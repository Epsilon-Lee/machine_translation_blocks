I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change , and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science .
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system .
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers , from 113 countries .
It &apos;s a big community . It &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
And every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics .
For us at Cambridge , it &apos;s as varied as the El Ni√±o oscillation , which affects weather and climate , to the assimilation of satellite data , to emissions from crops that produce biofuels , which is what I happen to study .
And in each one of these research areas , of which there are even more , there are PhD students , like me , and we study incredibly narrow topics , things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules .
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene , which is here . It &apos;s a small organic molecule . You &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .
But despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
It &apos;s a huge amount of stuff . It &apos;s equal to the weight of methane .
And because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmospheric system .
Because it &apos;s important to the atmospheric system , we go to all lengths to study this thing .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
Atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
But still , we look at the pieces .
We run enormous models on supercomputers ; this is what I happen to do .
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what &apos;s happening .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia . There are others .
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there .
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .
And this is the tower from below .
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .
And this plane , the model , BA146 , which was run by FAAM , normally flies 120 to 130 people .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
But we didn &apos;t just fly it . We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff .
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
And as you come around the banks in these valleys , the forces can get up to two Gs .
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they &apos;re on board .
So , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft doesn &apos;t look like any plane you would take on vacation .
It &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
And out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
And as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others .
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
In each one of those assessments that we write , we always tag on a summary , and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience .
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave .
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
Well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that .
People envision this as being very difficult .
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
We don &apos;t have to inject anything . We don &apos;t need radiation .
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter &apos;s mind taking place .
Now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
What &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
We &apos;ve collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he &apos;s inside the scanner .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
If he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
Chronic pain is an example . If you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
But if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
If we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain , we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .
What you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
This may shock you , but we &apos;re literally reading this person &apos;s brain in real time .
They &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
They &apos;re learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .
As they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
This is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients .
This is not &quot; The Matrix . &quot; You can only do this to yourself . You take control .
I &apos;ve seen inside my brain . You will too , soon .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences .
These are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that I don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
But I want to leave with you the big question .
We are the first generation that &apos;s going to be able to enter into , using this technology , the human mind and brain .
Where will we take it ?
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so I &apos;m going to dive straight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work .
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we have to get our shit together , and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .
I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging .
And then I &apos;m going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I &apos;m going to define as 30 years , applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .
Namely , essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
And of course , the last thing I &apos;m going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
That was easy . OK .
OK . Hands up : anyone in the audience who &apos;s not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
That &apos;s very good news , because I thought that was what the answer would be .
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
And here is that characteristic .
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .
Now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially , to talk about the comparison with foxhunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago .
I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .
And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me .
You know , a lot of people said , &quot; Well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
It &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
It &apos;s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . &quot;
But ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the British public , and certainly the majority of members of Parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s not just about life , of course -- -- it &apos;s about healthy life , you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun .
So really , this is how I would like to describe it .
It &apos;s a global trance .
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging .
And , I mean , OK , I &apos;m not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless .
There are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .
But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of proportion .
You know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about .
But the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
You know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong , then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what I say .
Now , there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is .
People worry about overpopulation ; they say , &quot; Well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing St. Giles carelessly .
And therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . &quot;
And that &apos;s true .
And you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
I don &apos;t agree with those answers . I think they basically don &apos;t work .
I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect .
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate , or a high death rate .
A high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies , in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .
And , I say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
If we vacillate , hesitate , and do not actually develop these therapies , then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies , but will not be , because we haven &apos;t developed them as quickly as we could -- we &apos;ll be denying those people an indefinite life span , and I consider that that is immoral .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
Aging is ghastly , but it &apos;s inevitable , so , you know , we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it &apos;s rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
But of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem .
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I &apos;m giving here .
A very simple definition .
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism .
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms , because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect .
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
That &apos;s a fine definition . So we can put it this way : we can say that , you know , we have this chain of events .
And there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
They &apos;re what I &apos;m calling here the &quot; gerontology approach &quot; and the &quot; geriatrics approach . &quot;
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .
Of course , it &apos;s a very short-term-ist strategy ; it &apos;s a losing battle , because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on .
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure .
But unfortunately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand metabolism very well .
In fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we &apos;re not really too good on yet .
We &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
Basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
So then , what do we do about that ?
I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
But it isn &apos;t .
Before I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m calling step two .
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 55 .
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; robust human rejuvenation . &quot; OK .
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live ?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it &apos;s simple , but it &apos;s not simple .
We can &apos;t just say , &quot; Well , if they &apos;re young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they &apos;ll live 30 years longer . &quot;
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
There are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose .
There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs .
Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames .
Fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .
We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
Computers : you can look at a more or less parallel time line , happening of course a bit later .
You can look at medical care . I mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
That in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp .
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game .
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
I &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
They &apos;ll never be perfect , but we &apos;ll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of , before we have any 200-year-olds .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot;
Well , it seems to get the point across .
So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
If you &apos;re already 100 , or even if you &apos;re 80 -- and an average 80-year-old , we probably can &apos;t do a lot for you with these therapies , because you &apos;re too close to death &apos;s door for the really initial , experimental therapies to be good enough for you .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
But if you &apos;re only 50 , then there &apos;s a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .
And of course , if you &apos;re a bit younger than that , then you &apos;re never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year-old -- we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these first-generation therapies .
But irrespective of that age , I &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
Alright , so finally I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the talk , my last seven-and-a-half minutes , on step one ; namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
I &apos;m calling it &quot; robust mouse rejuvenation , &quot; not very imaginatively .
And this is what it is .
I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average .
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday .
So , in other words , we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan , starting from the point that we started the therapies .
The question then is , what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ?
Which we can now , as I &apos;ve explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .
Secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
And thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
One has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame , in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities .
So , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
And finally , of course , I think it &apos;s fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier , the coping strategy .
That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice .
So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these mice , I &apos;m going to add a little bit to my description of aging .
I &apos;m going to use this word &quot; damage &quot; to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology .
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we &apos;re born .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
We can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .
And I &apos;m going to explain exactly what damage is And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
And the reason it &apos;s a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .
So there &apos;s a third approach , if we look at it this way .
We can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and I claim that the engineering approach is within range .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a losing battle , and it &apos;s something that we are within range of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t involve improving on evolution .
The engineering approach simply says , &quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
We know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
Why do I say that we &apos;re in range ? Well , this is basically it .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
It &apos;s a list of types of pathology that are age-related , and it &apos;s just an incomplete list .
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology .
And there are only seven of them .
They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them .
Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
One can say , &quot; OK , what are we made of ? &quot;
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
So , these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news , because it means that , you know , we &apos;ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years , so the fact that we haven &apos;t extended this list is a pretty good indication that there &apos;s no extension to be done .
However , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
I haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it .
We do need to really start trying .
So of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
I &apos;ve published a great deal on this ; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based , and there &apos;s quite a lot of detail there .
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I &apos;m predicting here .
So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better damn well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong .
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .
So , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
One thing is , you know , you &apos;ll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time , and everyone said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s obviously impossible . &quot;
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
We have various strategies -- there &apos;s the Methuselah Mouse Prize , which is basically an incentive to innovate , and to do what you think is going to work , and you get money for it if you win .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
But , I mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?
Not very long . OK .
It &apos;s got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this .
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
OK . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
Audience : Since you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it , why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 .
Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die .
So , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer .
I &apos;m going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question , which I happen to agree with , which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ; &#91; aging &#93; is simply a product of evolutionary neglect .
In other words , we have aging because it &apos;s hard work not to have aging ; you need more genetic pathways , more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly , and that carries on being true the longer you push it out .
So , to the extent that evolution doesn &apos;t matter , doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there &apos;s a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that &apos;s why there are no immortal species .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
If I project that , that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
That means that I &apos;m one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ?
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade .
So , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
Audience : I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
If that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate , especially neurons , but we don &apos;t want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway , because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function .
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells .
Trees epitomize stasis .
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations , but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing .
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir , and what I learned was that different species have different signatures , like a Picasso versus a Monet .
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , I simply measured and summed each of those lines .
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
You might have a guess .
The answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism , and one of those entities is our prisons .
Prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
Funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons , and I think the answer is yes .
In the year 2007 , I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections .
Working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons .
We give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
That , I think , is movement .
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state .
That , I think , is movement .
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands .
That , I think , is movement .
And just recently , we &apos;ve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities .
They &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
They &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they &apos;re placed in immobile booths like this .
For one hour a day they &apos;re brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards .
Although we can &apos;t bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
This is Mr. Lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
And so what we see , I think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks .
But if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
Thank you very much .
A few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
In 2006 , young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps .
And since then I &apos;ve followed the unfolding issue of worker rights .
In the last six months , more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled .
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
1.1 million of them .
Mainly Indian , Pakistani , Sri Lankan and Nepalese , these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air conditioning , and their passports taken away .
While it &apos;s easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we &apos;re equally , if not more , accountable .
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged , but the numbers are simply overwhelming .
In August 2008 , UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
And last summer , more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages , for the poor quality of food , and inadequate housing .
And then the financial collapse happened .
When the contractors have gone bust , as they &apos;ve been overleveraged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , documentation , passports , and tickets home for these workers .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
The question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a developer , if you know this is going on , as we go to the sights every single week , are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations ?
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
What good is it to build a zero-carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best ?
Now , recently I &apos;ve been told I &apos;ve been taking the high road .
But , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
So let &apos;s not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
And that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
Let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
Thank you .
We see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . We &apos;ve lived with them all our lives .
But there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
They seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations , and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients .
A few months ago , I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work .
They told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer &apos;s .
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie , the old lady .
I went in to see her .
It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence , but she &apos;d been very startled and very bewildered , because she &apos;d been seeing things .
And she told me -- the nurses hadn &apos;t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; People in Eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
I see a white building . It &apos;s snowing , a soft snow .
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I see a lot of children . They are walking up and down stairs .
They wear bright colors , rose and blue , like Eastern dress . &quot;
Sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not like a dream . It &apos;s like a movie . &quot;
She said , &quot; It &apos;s got color . It &apos;s got motion .
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
She said , &quot; All these people with Eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . &quot;
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
But she was frightened . She &apos;d lived 95 years and she &apos;d never had a hallucination before .
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
She had no control over them .
She said she didn &apos;t recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
And none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . She had no medical problems .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;
I said , &quot; There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
This was originally described , &quot; I said , &quot; right back in the 18th century , by a man called Charles Bonnet .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
And she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious .
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not crazy . I &apos;m not demented . I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
You don &apos;t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
Now with the original description in the 18th century , Charles Bonnet did not have them .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
And in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
But sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
So on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; And who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Alas , Grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . &quot;
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
It &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
Charles Lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
On one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
That was the only figure he recognized .
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding .
But when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
With him and with Rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; -- and I said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
With another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
On one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
And he turned around . And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
And then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
Once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned .
And then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
This was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
Now , I don &apos;t watch Sesame Street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; Why Kermit ? &quot; She said , &quot; Kermit the Frog means nothing to me .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
As a physician , I have to try and define what &apos;s going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they &apos;re not going insane .
Something like 10 percent , as I said , of visually impaired people get these .
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
In particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you &apos;re going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
Psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . They accuse you .
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations .
There is a film . You &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
Faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
Fascinatingly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating .
And in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
When images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
And it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
It &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes .
Around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
So you may not only have &quot; car &quot; cells , you may have &quot; Aston Martin &quot; cells .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Now , at this level , in what &apos;s called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
It &apos;s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome , you don &apos;t go to those higher levels .
You &apos;re in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
And instead of getting normal perception , you &apos;re getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
So , suddenly you see a face . Suddenly you see a car .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
When these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
But in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recognize the people . I can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
Think of the number of blind people .
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
Finally , I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
Charles Bonnet said , 250 years ago -- he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
Now , 250 years later , I think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
I &apos;m blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
Because you understand what &apos;s doing it , it doesn &apos;t make you worried ?
OS : Well they don &apos;t disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which I ignore .
They occasionally interest me , and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
I &apos;ve gone and had an fMRI myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things , which I also have , in visual migraine , I wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
You name it , I bred it , and I sold them to pet shops .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Growing up in a multicultural environment , we had African students in the house , and I learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
I became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and I focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
I started working in the industry , but I wasn &apos;t really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development , which is really true .
As long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
Actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
Well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures .
And actually , our product -- what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
You see an operator , a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
Rats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
Well don &apos;t talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
A clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
First of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
Once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
Once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
In the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
This consists of 400 square meters .
There &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
If the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way .
Maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
This is our team in Mozambique : one Tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows .
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people .
They have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
Moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
But with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
Question of scale .
If you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
And there &apos;s about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine , but worldwide last year , almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection .
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
Microscopy , the standard WHO procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
In Tanzania -- the numbers don &apos;t lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die .
It means that , if you have T.B. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on .
And if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in HIV-positives , it makes sense .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
is &quot; tering , &quot; which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar .
Already the old Chinese and the Greek , Hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals , trained rats on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 89 percent sensitivity , 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .
This is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
We &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
And by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
Just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
A cage like this -- A cage like this -- provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
I just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
Throughout last year , we &apos;ve been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
So this is really considerable .
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
So , to standardize this .
Also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
To conclude , I would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you , whether they are environmental , technological , animal , or human .
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work .
Thank you very much .
Well , Arthur C. Clarke , a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s , said that , &quot; We overestimate technology in the short term , and we underestimate it in the long term . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots .
That we &apos;re overestimating the technology in the short term .
But I am worried whether we &apos;re going to get the technology we need in the long term .
Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we , our society , is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future .
So I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
Back in 1957 , there was a Spencer Tracy , Katharine Hepburn movie .
So you know how it ended up , Spencer Tracy brought a computer , a mainframe computer of 1957 , in to help the librarians .
The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives , &quot; What are the names of Santa &apos;s reindeer ? &quot;
And they would look that up .
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job .
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn &apos;t much use for that job .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957 .
It wasn &apos;t until the Internet came into play , that the need for librarians went down .
And I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today .
And we can just ask : &quot; What are the names of Santa &apos;s reindeer ? &quot; and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask .
By the way , the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period , because librarians became partners of computers .
Computers became tools , and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper , and they calculated by hand .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C. &apos; s , the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers , not to replace office workers , but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers .
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
It increased their capabilities .
They no longer had to do the mundane computations , but they could do something much more .
Now today , we &apos;re starting to see robots in our lives .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse &apos;s aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients .
In fact , robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways .
But I think when it comes to factory robots , people are sort of afraid , because factory robots are dangerous to be around .
In order to program them , you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
And I think it &apos;s the sort of technology that &apos;s gone wrong .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with .
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
And Baxter , I see , as a way -- a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
And if the lighting isn &apos;t too extreme -- Ah , ah ! There it is . It &apos;s picked up the object off the conveyor .
It &apos;s going to come bring it over here and put it down .
And then it &apos;ll go back , reach for another object .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
By the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?
The eyes are on the screen there .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
So a person that &apos;s interacting with the robot understands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its motions .
Here Chris took the object out of its hand , and Baxter didn &apos;t go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
It &apos;s got a little bit of basic common sense , goes and picks the objects .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
You wouldn &apos;t want to do this with a current industrial robot .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It feels the force , understands that Chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface .
And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now .
And when he grabs an arm , it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen .
You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm .
He &apos;s going to put something in its hand , he &apos;s going to bring it over here , press a button and let go of that thing in the hand .
And the robot figures out , ah , he must mean I want to put stuff down .
It puts a little icon there .
He comes over here , and he gets the fingers to grasp together , and the robot infers , ah , you want an object for me to pick up .
That puts the green icon there .
He &apos;s going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from .
It just moves it around , and the robot figures out that was an area search .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
And now he &apos;s going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking .
So as we continue here , I want to tell you about what this is like in factories .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot , she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory .
She decided she really liked robots .
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better , one of the questions we asked them was , &quot; Do you want your children to work in a factory ? &quot;
The universal answer was &quot; No , I want a better job than that for my children . &quot;
And as a result of that , Mildred is very typical of today &apos;s factory workers in the U.S.
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
And as their tasks become more onerous on them , we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with , so that they can be part of the solution , so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
And so our vision is that Mildred who &apos;s the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer .
She lifts her game , like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do .
We &apos;re not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use .
They &apos;re tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes .
There &apos;s two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
This is the percentage of adults who are working age .
And it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
But over the next 40 years , it &apos;s going to change dramatically , even in China .
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
And turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boomers get to retirement age .
That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services .
But more than that , as we get older we get more frail and we can &apos;t do all the tasks we used to do .
If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers , before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
And as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
And I think we &apos;re really going to have to have robots to help us .
And I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older .
Getting the groceries in from the car , up the stairs , into the kitchen .
Or even , as we get very much older , driving our cars to go visit people .
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution .
So they don &apos;t have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them .
And so I really think that we &apos;re going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives . And that we will -- Here , Baxter , it &apos;s good .
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives .
Thanks very much .
Hi everyone . I &apos;m Sirena .
I &apos;m 11 years old and from Connecticut .
Well , I &apos;m not really sure why I &apos;m here .
I mean , what does this have to do with technology , entertainment and design ?
Well , I count my iPod , cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that .
So I did a little research on it .
Well , this is what I found .
Of course , I hope I can memorize it .
The violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings .
By playing the string , the string vibrates and produces a sound wave .
Sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think .
Okay . On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length , that changes the frequency of the sound wave .
Oh , my gosh !
Okay . This is sort of a technology but I can call it a 16th-century technology .
But actually , the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
Design -- I love its design .
I remember when I was little my mom asked me , would you like to play the violin or the piano ?
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day .
This is small and lightweight .
I can play from standing , sitting or walking .
And you know what ?
The best of all is that if I don &apos;t want to practice , I can hide it .
The violin is very beautiful .
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady but , whether you like it or not , it &apos;s been so for more than 400 years , unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated .
But I think it &apos;s very personal and unique that , although each violin looks pretty similar , that no two violins sound the same .
Even from the same maker or based on the same model .
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment , but actually , the instrument itself isn &apos;t very entertaining .
I mean , when I first got my violin and tried to play around , it was actually , really bad because it didn &apos;t sound like the way I &apos;d heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it wasn &apos;t entertaining at all .
But besides , my brother found this very funny .
Yuk , yuk , yuk .
A few years later I heard a joke about the greatest violinist , Jascha Heifetz .
After Mr. Heifetz &apos;s concert a lady came over and complimented , &quot; Oh , Mr. Heifetz , your violin sounded so great tonight . &quot;
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person , so he picked up his violin and said , &quot; Funny , I don &apos;t hear anything . &quot;
And now , I realize that as the musician , we human beings , we have a great mind , artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .
Now , I know why I &apos;m here .
At first I thought I was just going to be here to perform , but unexpectedly , I learned and enjoyed much more .
But ... although some of them were quite up there for me .
Like the multi-dimension stuff .
I mean , honestly , I &apos;d be happy enough if I can actually get my two dimension correct in school .
But actually , the most impressive thing to me is that ... well , actually , I would also like to stand this for all children is to say , thank you , to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better .
Thank you .
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy .
Because I was new to the city , I didn &apos;t have access to a stage , so I decided to create my own in public places .
So the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride .
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
And as you &apos;ll see now , I &apos;m not wearing pants .
So at this point -- at this point she &apos;s noticed me , but in New York there &apos;s weirdos on any given train car .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
She goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; Rape . &quot;
So she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .
Now in the meantime , I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And we &apos;ll act as if it &apos;s just an unfortunate mistake we &apos;ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold January day .
So at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
Now in the meantime , the two Danish guys to the left of the camera , they &apos;re cracking up .
They think this is the funniest thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
And I love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
And then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
At the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; Thank you . That &apos;s exactly what I needed today , &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do .
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
It &apos;s a prank , but it &apos;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
This January , we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city .
And also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
Well one day I was walking through Union Square , and I saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
And it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back-lit with florescent lighting , and she was very much onstage , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why she was doing it .
After about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this .
So I got inspired by that .
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do .
So this project is called Look Up More . We had 70 actors dress in black .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out &quot; Look Up More , &quot; the name of the project .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
So then I gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21 , and he danced .
There were several other activities .
We had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement .
And because it was in Union Square Park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon .
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around . &quot;
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately , and I said , &quot; Yes , you are correct .
I think I &apos;ll try to do that this weekend . Thank you . &quot;
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
We had about 80 people show up to participate , entering one-by-one .
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
And I told people , &quot; Don &apos;t work . Don &apos;t actually do work .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt .
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
And in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
The managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
That &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
Ultimately , the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
So we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them .
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators .
And it &apos;s a very depressing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crowded .
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
People are coming in from Queens , transferring from the E train to the 6 train .
And they &apos;re going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
He gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
And that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
So I &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is : &quot; These people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and I &apos;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments , but that one &apos;s always bothered me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
You know , every Saturday and Sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
And I &apos;ve never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , &quot; All those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
But I think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library .
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
And I think that &apos;s sort of the point of Improv Everywhere .
It &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
As long as it &apos;s fun and it seems like it &apos;s going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
And I think , as adults , we need to learn that there &apos;s no right or wrong way to play .
Thank you very much .
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells , like chalk .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by how nature makes materials , and there &apos;s a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure , but they &apos;re formed at the nanoscale .
They &apos;re formed at the nanoscale , and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures .
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures , like batteries and like solar cells ?
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did , in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure , using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ?
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish ?
Or , what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time , and do so in an environmentally friendly way ?
And so , going back to this abalone shell , besides being nano-structured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female abalone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; This is how to build an exquisite material .
Here &apos;s how to do it at room temperature and pressure , using non-toxic materials . &quot;
Same with diatoms , which are shown right here , which are glasseous structures .
Every time the diatoms replicate , they give the genetic information that says , &quot; Here &apos;s how to build glass in the ocean that &apos;s perfectly nano-structured .
And you can do it the same , over and over again . &quot;
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery ?
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .
But anyone who &apos;s ever had , or knows , small children knows they &apos;re incredibly complex organisms .
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don &apos;t want to do , it &apos;s very difficult .
So when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox , so that they can build a structure that will be important to me ?
Also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of Earth .
Basically , it took a billion years to have life on Earth .
And very rapidly , they became multi-cellular , they could replicate , they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source .
But it wasn &apos;t until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials .
Before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment , and organisms learned how to make hard materials .
And so that &apos;s what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table .
Now if you look at biology , there &apos;s many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you &apos;ve heard about that are already nano-structured .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV ?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
So here are some examples : these are some natural shells .
There are natural biological materials .
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nano-structured .
There &apos;s diatoms made out of SIO2 , and they &apos;re magnetotactic bacteria that make small , single-domain magnets used for navigation .
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale , and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
Now , going back to the abalone shell , the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And they can pull calcium out of the environment , put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate , calcium and carbonate .
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids , which says , &quot; This is how to build the structure .
Here &apos;s the DNA sequence , here &apos;s the protein sequence in order to do it . &quot;
And so an interesting idea is , what if you could take any material that you wanted , or any element on the periodic table , and find its corresponding DNA sequence , then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure , but not build an abalone shell -- build something that , through nature , it has never had the opportunity to work with yet .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT , I have a periodic table made that says , &quot; Welcome to MIT . Now you &apos;re in your element . &quot;
And you flip it over , and it &apos;s the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges .
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And I know it says MIT , and this is Caltech , but I have a couple extra if people want it .
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT , and I really wanted to give him a periodic table .
So I stayed up at night , and I talked to my husband , &quot; How do I give President Obama a periodic table ?
What if he says , &apos; Oh , I already have one , &apos; or , &apos; I &apos;ve already memorized it &apos; ? &quot;
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit .
And then afterward , I said , &quot; Sir , I want to give you the periodic table in case you &apos;re ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight . &quot;
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass .
And so he looked at it , and he said , &quot; Thank you . I &apos;ll look at it periodically . &quot;
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , &quot; And people at MIT , they give out periodic tables . &quot;
So basically what I didn &apos;t tell you is that about 500 million years ago , organisms starter making materials , but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it .
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly .
And so we use a virus that &apos;s a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that &apos;s job is to infect bacteria .
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it .
And by doing that , it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein .
Now if you take all billion viruses , and you can put them in one drop of liquid , you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .
And through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you &apos;d like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
So basically , viruses can &apos;t replicate themselves ; they need a host .
Once you find that one out of a billion , you infect it into a bacteria , and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence .
And so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales .
And these viruses are long and skinny , and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries .
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab .
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
And so through a process of selection evolution , we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking , high-powered battery that &apos;s all made at room temperature , basically at the bench top .
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference .
I brought it here .
You can see it in this case -- that &apos;s lighting this LED .
Now if we could scale this , you could actually use it to run your Prius , which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car .
But it &apos;s basically -- you can pull one out of a billion .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
Basically , you make an amplification in the lab , and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
And what we &apos;ve been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna , and you get an energy transfer across the virus .
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
My students promised me it would work .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
When you shine light on them , you can see them bubbling .
In this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
And basically , by controlling the genes , you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
We &apos;ve been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device .
And what we &apos;ve found is through genetic engineering , we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward .
So this is a virus-based solar cell .
Through evolution and selection , we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell .
So I hope that I &apos;ve convinced you that there &apos;s a lot of great , interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force , or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials , to make things that nature hasn &apos;t yet dreamed of making .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
For the last 8 years , I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means .
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : Where is the Palestinian Gandhi ?
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers .
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
This divide between what &apos;s happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don &apos;t have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful .
So I &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank , Gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be Palestine .
I believe that what &apos;s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus .
About seven years ago , they faced extinction , because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank .
Through inspired local leadership , they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
Let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground .
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel .
Here in Budrus , we realized the wall would steal our land .
Israeli The fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror .
Today you &apos;re invited to a peaceful march .
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters .
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that .
But I think the girls could do it .
Fatah Party Member : We must empty our minds of traditional thinking .
Hamas Party Member : We were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
Israeli Activist : I was sure we were all going to die .
But there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
Israeli A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the &#91; unclear &#93; .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Julia Bacha : When I first heard about the story of Budrus , I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago , in 2003 .
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful .
The residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories .
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem .
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow , or even survive , in Palestine .
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue , it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight .
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room .
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit .
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior , since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it .
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
In fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today .
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank , in Gaza and in East Jerusalem , I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation .
In a village called Wallajeh , which sits very close to Jerusalem , the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus .
They were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the West Bank or Jerusalem .
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
So we organized a screening .
A week later , they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .
The organizers say that the villagers , upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film , felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing , that people cared .
So they kept on going .
On the Israeli side , there is a new peace movement called Solidariot , which means solidarity in Hebrew .
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools .
They report that Israelis who had never been active before , upon seeing the film , understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities .
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior .
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil &apos;in , Ni &apos;lin , Wallajeh , in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible , valued and effective in their work .
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don &apos;t pay attention to these efforts , they are invisible , and it &apos;s as if they never happened .
But I have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply .
If they multiply , their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
Let &apos;s give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere .
Thank you .
As a culture , we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future , and where we might move forward from this point .
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling .
But I want to tell you a different story here today .
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
My work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustainability , teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food , how to build buildings using local materials , how to generate their own energy , and so on .
I lived in Ireland , built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland , and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing .
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and moderating the outputs at the other end .
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly .
And in order to introduce you to that , I &apos;ve got something here that I &apos;m going to unveil , which is one of the great marvels of the modern age .
And it &apos;s something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate .
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
This is a liter of oil .
This bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials , medicine , modern clothing , laptops , a whole range of different things .
It gives us an energy return that &apos;s unimaginable , historically .
We &apos;ve based the design of our settlements , our business models , our transport plans , even the idea of economic growth , some would argue , on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity .
Yet , when we take a step back , and look over the span of history , at what we might call the petroleum interval , it &apos;s a short period in history where we &apos;ve discovered this extraordinary material , and then based a whole way of life around it .
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability .
And it &apos;s increasingly clear that we aren &apos;t going to be able to rely on the fact that we &apos;re going to have this at our disposal forever .
For every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
And that gap continues to widen .
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling .
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
And that &apos;s why , now , the new breakthroughs , the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta , or at the bottom of the oceans .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
But of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
The moment when the world on average passes this peak , people wonder when that &apos;s going to happen .
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high .
But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
No . But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are .
There is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underpins this transition approach .
But the thing that I notice , as I talk to climate scientists , is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes , as the data that &apos;s coming in , which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about .
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100 , in their worst case scenario .
Actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years &apos; time .
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms , it would offset all the savings that we need to make , in carbon , over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change .
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
But I &apos;m always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us .
&quot; The generation that lived at the top of the mountain , that partied so hard , and so abused its inheritance . &quot;
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil , before we had fossil fuels , and people relied on their own muscle , animal muscle energy , or a little bit of wind , little bit of water energy .
We had stories like &quot; The Seven-League Boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal .
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot , where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words , this pot would just make as much food as you liked , without you having to do any work , provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge .
Otherwise you &apos;d flood your entire town with warm porridge .
There is the story of &quot; The Elves and the Shoemaker . &quot;
The people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them .
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet .
We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco .
And we have the elves in the form of China .
But we don &apos;t appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been .
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we &apos;re going to go .
And I would argue that there are four . There is the idea of business as usual , that the future will be like the present , just more of it .
But as we &apos;ve seen over the last year , I think that &apos;s an idea that is increasingly coming into question .
And in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
There is the idea of hitting the wall , that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse .
This is a popular story in some places .
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely .
And it &apos;s an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks , the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis , that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints , the idea that we &apos;ll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side , the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can &apos;t create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse .
And as we sit , exchanging free ideas with each other , there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers , extracting the minerals to make all of those things .
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances , usually at the expense of the local , more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past , which we &apos;ve so effectively devalued and dismantled .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face , and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s viral . It seems to spread under the radar very , very quickly .
It &apos;s open source . It &apos;s something which everybody who &apos;s involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
It &apos;s self-organizing . There is no great central organization that pushes this ; people just pick up an idea and they run with it , and they implement it where they are .
It &apos;s solutions-focused . It &apos;s very much looking at what people can do where they are , to respond to this .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
Transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they &apos;re doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it feels historic . It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
People have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it .
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience .
And I think , in many ways , the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
And it &apos;s really about how systems , settlements , withstand shock from the outside .
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don &apos;t just unravel and fall to pieces .
And I think it &apos;s a more useful concept than sustainability , as I said .
When our supermarkets have only two or three days &apos; worth of food in them at any one time , often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .
Looking through the lens of resilience , we really question how we &apos;ve let ourselves get into a situation that &apos;s so vulnerable .
Resilience runs much deeper : it &apos;s about building modularity into what we do , building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us .
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association , in 1897 .
This is at a time when the city of Bristol , which is quite close to here , was surrounded by commercial market gardens , which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town , and created a lot of employment for people , as well .
There was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
So how does this transition idea work ?
So basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
They pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town .
They show films , they give talks , and so on .
It &apos;s a process which is playful and creative and informative .
Then they start to form working groups , looking at different aspects of this , and then from that , there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable .
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland , where I was teaching , and has since spread .
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .
They are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
But what do they actually do ? You know , it &apos;s a kind of nice idea , but what do they actually do on the ground ?
Well , I think it &apos;s really important to make the point that actually you know , this isn &apos;t something which is going to do everything on its own .
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on .
We need national responses . We need local government responses .
But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front , making unelectable policies electable , over the next 5 to 10 years .
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies , community-owned energy companies , where the community can invest money into itself , to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
Newent in the Forest of Dean : big polytunnel they built for the school ; the kids are learning how to grow food .
Promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who don &apos;t have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they aren &apos;t using anymore .
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .
This is Lewes in Sussex , who have recently launched the Lewes Pound , a currency that you can only spend within the town , as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy .
You take it anywhere else , it &apos;s not worth anything .
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan , which is basically to develop a plan B for the town .
Most of our local authorities , when they sit down to plan for the next five , 10 , 15 , 20 years of a community , still start by assuming that there will be more energy , more cars , more housing , more jobs , more growth , and so on .
What does it look like if that &apos;s not the case ? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody ?
As a friend of mine says , &quot; Life is a series of things you &apos;re not quite ready for . &quot;
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
From three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has virally swept around the world .
We &apos;re getting a lot of interest from government . Ed Miliband , the energy minister of this country , was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener .
Which he did -- -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea .
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities , Leicestershire and Somerset . And in Stroud , the transition group there , in effect , wrote the local government &apos;s food plan .
And the head of the council said , &quot; If we didn &apos;t have Transition Stroud , we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
As we see the spread of it , we see national hubs emerging .
In Scotland , the Scottish government &apos;s climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions .
I think I &apos;d like to just return at the end to the idea of stories .
Because I think stories are vital here .
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves , we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here .
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing .
Stories about the community that &apos;s produced its own 21 pound note , for example , the school that &apos;s turned its car park into a food garden , the community that &apos;s founded its own energy company .
And for me , one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden . Because the last time that was done , when Eleanor Roosevelt did it , it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States .
So the question I &apos;d like to leave you with , really , is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive , how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions , while also building resilience ?
Personally , I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
But let us honor what it has bought us , and move forward from this point .
Because if we cling to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable .
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the Oil Age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other .
Thank you very much .
My name is Emiliano Salinas and I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
As a child , I had a pretty normal life : I would go to school , play with my friends and cousins .
But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed .
What I &apos;m about to say , at least some of what I &apos;m about to say , will cause controversy .
Firstly , because I &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
And secondly , because what I &apos;m going to say is true , and it will make a lot of people nervous because it &apos;s something we don &apos;t want to hear .
But it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I &apos;m Carlos Salinas de Gortari &apos;s son from the fact that I &apos;m a citizen concerned about the country &apos;s current situation .
Don &apos;t worry .
It &apos;s not necessary for understanding the importance of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
What we don &apos;t agree on is what the problem actually is .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
But we won &apos;t be able to take care of any of those things if we don &apos;t solve the real problem we have in Mexico first .
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
We are a country of victims .
Historically , we &apos;ve always acted as victims of something or somebody .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
If only we stopped feeling like victims , if we stopped acting as victims , our country would change so much !
I &apos;m going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible , involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands .
I &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
Today , much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we &apos;re going through .
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
Daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
It &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
And if we don &apos;t do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
And that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
But , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear -- and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
Let &apos;s think about Mexican streets : they &apos;re unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
So streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
We need to confront this fear .
We need to move Mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
We need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico .
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
This shows that society is desperate and it &apos;s taking the law into its own hands .
Unfortunately , violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence .
If I &apos;m violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
So civil action is vital , but it &apos;s also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
It &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
Two years ago , in Galena City , Chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , Eric Le Bar√≥n .
His brothers , Benjam√≠n and Juli√°n , got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action : to pay the ransom , to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help .
In the end , Benjam√≠n and Juli√°n decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
So what did they do ?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Bar√≥n to go to Chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
They sent a message to the kidnappers : &quot; If you want your ransom come and get it .
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Seven days later , Eric was set free and was able to return home .
This is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjam√≠n Le Bar√≥n was murdered .
But Juli√°n Le Bar√≥n keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year .
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
With a thousand Juli√°ns working together , Mexico would be a very different country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
I was born in Mexico , I grew up in Mexico and along the way , I learned to love Mexico .
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love Mexico .
I &apos;ve traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year &apos;s floods .
The passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
I think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
Our mother , Mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Mahatma Gandhi , one of the greatest civil fighters of all time , said , &quot; Be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative .
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , El Grito , the Day of the Dead , San Miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn &apos;t disappear from this world .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
The battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
2000 years ago , the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican .
He said , &quot; Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living . &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;d like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to June 24 , 1833 .
The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge .
It &apos;s the first night of the meeting , and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever .
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it &apos;s the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge , who hadn &apos;t even left his house in years until that day .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
&quot; You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers . &quot;
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs .
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association .
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience .
He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist .
&quot; If &apos; philosophers &apos; is taken to be too wide and lofty a term , &quot; he said , &quot; then , by analogy with &apos; artist , &apos; we may form &apos; scientist . &apos; &quot; This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public , only 179 years ago .
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school , and it kind of blew me away .
I mean , how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833 ?
What were scientists called before ?
What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment ?
Prior to this meeting , those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs .
Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils , like Charles Darwin , for example , or , the hired help of a nobleman , like Joseph Priestley , who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen .
After this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in 1812 : Charles Babbage , John Herschel , Richard Jones and William Whewell .
These were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
Charles Babbage , I think known to most TEDsters , invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer .
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere , and , in his spare time , co-invented photography .
I &apos;m sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time .
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx .
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist , as well as the words anode , cathode and ion , but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides .
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813 , the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts .
They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
It was time for a new revolution , which they pledged to bring about , and what &apos;s so amazing about these guys is , not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams , but they actually carried them out , even beyond their wildest dreams .
And I &apos;m going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made .
About 200 years before , Francis Bacon and then , later , Isaac Newton , had proposed an inductive scientific method .
Now that &apos;s a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws , which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise .
However , in 1809 , David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different , deductive method .
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics , this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers , university students and members of the public .
Reading one of Herschel &apos;s books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say , &quot; Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me .
It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge . &quot;
It also shaped Darwin &apos;s scientific method , as well as that used by his peers .
&#91; Science for the public good &#93; Previously , it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen , or for one &apos;s own personal gain .
For example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
Whewell &apos;s worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters &apos; knowledge to all ship captains .
Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa , and , as he complained to Whewell , he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage &apos;s engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society .
In the days before pocket calculators , the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers , insurance agents , ship captains , engineers ‚Äî were to be found in lookup books like this , filled with tables of figures .
These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers , but these calculations were really difficult .
I mean , this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year .
Each month required 1,365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
Babbage &apos;s difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables .
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans .
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California , and it calculates accurately . It actually works .
Later , Babbage &apos;s analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
It was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea Babbage took from Jacquard &apos;s loom .
Tragically , Babbage &apos;s engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non-human computers would have no usefulness for the public .
&#91; New scientific institutions &#93; Founded in Bacon &apos;s time , the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world .
By the 19th century , it had become a kind of gentleman &apos;s club populated mainly by antiquarians , literary men and the nobility .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies , including the British Association .
These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results .
They reinstated the tradition of the Q &amp; amp ; A after scientific papers were read , which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly .
And for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
Members were encouraged to bring their wives , daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association , and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one , they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well .
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members .
&#91; External funding for science &#93; Up to the 19th century , natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies .
Occasionally , there were prizes , such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century , for solving the so-called longitude problem , but prizes were only given after the fact , when they were given at all .
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club , the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy , the tides , fossil fish , shipbuilding , and many other areas .
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research , but they also encouraged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question .
Eventually , the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit , and this has become -- fortunately it &apos;s become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today .
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
They would have been deeply dismayed by today &apos;s disjunction between science and the rest of culture .
It &apos;s shocking to realize that only 28 percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy , and this was tested by asking simple questions like , &quot; Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time ? &quot;
and &quot; What proportion of the Earth is covered in water ? &quot;
Once scientists became members of a professional group , they were slowly walled off from the rest of us .
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends .
Charles Darwin said , &quot; I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work . &quot;
In fact , &quot; Origin of Species &quot; was written for a general and popular audience , and was widely read when it first appeared .
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten , that science is not only for scientists .
Thank you .
I want to talk about the election .
For the first time in the United States , a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
And he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race , of any party -- in history .
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier -- Democrats really like seeing this transition here , where almost every state becomes bluer , becomes more democratic -- even states Obama lost , like out west , those states became more blue .
In the south , in the northeast , almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
No big surprise , Obama couldn &apos;t do better than Kerry there .
Or in Arizona , which is John McCain &apos;s home , Obama didn &apos;t have much improvement .
But there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
This kind of Arkansas , Tennessee , Oklahoma , West Virginia region .
Now if you look at &apos; 96 , Bill Clinton -- the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in &apos; 96 , you see real big differences in this part of the country right here , the kind of Appalachians , Ozarks , highlands region , as I call it : 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in &apos; 96 to how Obama did in 2008 .
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas , but these are very , very profound differences .
So , when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas , you know .
There is a book written called , &quot; What &apos;s the Matter with Kansas ? &quot;
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas .
He lost badly but every Democrat does .
He lost no worse than most people do .
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations .
We think of a bunch of rednecks , quote , unquote , with guns .
And we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama .
We think it &apos;s a matter of race . And is this fair ?
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas , and this part of the country ?
And the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
We know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people .
Actually we didn &apos;t ask them , but when they conducted exit polls in every state , in 37 states , out of the 50 , they asked a question , that was pretty direct , about race .
They asked this question .
In deciding your vote for President today , was the race We &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; Yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
We &apos;re looking for this behavior among white voters or , really , non-black voters .
So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
In Louisiana , about one in five white voters said , &quot; Yes , one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American . &quot;
If those people had voted for Obama , even half of them , Obama would have won Louisiana safely .
Same is true with , I think , all of these states you see on the top of the list .
Meanwhile , California , New York , we can say , &quot; Oh we &apos;re enlightened &quot; but you know , certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted , I suppose , manifestation of racially-based voting .
Here is the same data on a map .
You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said , &quot; Yes , Barack Obama &apos;s race was a problem for me . &quot;
You see , comparing the map to &apos; 96 , you see an overlap here .
This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country .
So we have to ask why .
Is racism predictable in some way ?
Is there something driving this ?
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don &apos;t understand , and Kentucky ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time -- things like income , and religion , education .
Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November 4th ?
And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships , one of which is education , where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red , and you see this part of the country , the kind of Appalachians region , is less educated . It &apos;s just a fact .
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
The other variable that &apos;s important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
States that are more rural -- even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine -- they exhibit a little bit of this racially-based voting against Barack Obama .
So it &apos;s the combination of these two things : it &apos;s education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we &apos;ll talk about more in a moment .
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they &apos;re both very rural , and they are educationally impoverished .
So yes , racism is predictable .
These things , among maybe other variables , but these things seem to predict it .
We &apos;re going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the General Social Survey .
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
One simple question they asked is , &quot; Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? &quot;
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different .
In cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race , but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
Probably because if you live on a farm , you might not have a lot of neighbors , period .
But nevertheless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
So what we &apos;re going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .
And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes , not a lot of difference .
This was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
But you see Democrats versus Republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action , which is kind of a political question , a policy question about race , if you will -- not much difference here .
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period .
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really .
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will , &quot; Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage ? &quot;
There is a big difference .
People who don &apos;t have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do .
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
And likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , &quot; Would you not vote for a qualified black president ? &quot;
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say , &quot; That would give me a problem . &quot;
So it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
It &apos;s about who you live with .
Racism is predictable . And it &apos;s predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you , people of other races .
So if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races .
I have a couple of very obvious , I suppose , ideas for maybe how to do that .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
But also not everyone wants to live in a city , certainly not a city like New York .
So we can think more about things like street grids .
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing , Michigan .
It &apos;s a traditional Midwestern community , which means you have real grid .
You have real neighborhoods and real trees , and real streets you can walk on .
And you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
And as a result it &apos;s a very tolerant community , which is different , I think , than something like this , which is in Schaumburg , Illinois , where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that .
I think that actually this type of urban design , which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan .
But also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad .
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU , have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas , and vice versa . Do it at the high school level .
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
But the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what I call designable .
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn &apos;t , we can start to design solutions to it .
So that &apos;s all I have to say . Thank you very much .
Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart , which is beauty .
I do the philosophy of art , aesthetics , actually , for a living .
I try to figure out intellectually , philosophically , psychologically , what the experience of beauty is , what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it .
Now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
I mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby &apos;s face , Berlioz &apos;s &quot; Harold in Italy , &quot; movies like &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; or the plays of Chekhov , a central California landscape , a Hokusai view of Mt . Fuji , &quot; Der Rosenkavalier , &quot; a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match , Van Gogh &apos;s &quot; Starry Night , &quot; a Jane Austen novel , Fred Astaire dancing across the screen .
This brief list includes human beings , natural landforms , works of art and skilled human actions .
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
I can , however , give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have .
And we get it not from a philosopher of art , not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic .
No , this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding , and you know who I mean : Charles Darwin .
Of course , a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question , &quot; What is beauty ? &quot;
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
It &apos;s whatever moves you personally .
Or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder .
People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums , while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth .
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere .
There are many differences among the arts , but there are also universal , cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values .
How can we explain this universality ?
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric , largely pleistocene environments , where we became fully human , but also by the social situations in which we evolved .
This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory .
I mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
Now , I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty , with its emotional intensity and pleasure , belongs to our evolved human psychology .
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations .
Beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
As many of you will know , evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms .
The first of these is natural selection -- that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions , such as the horrid smell of rotting meat , or fears , such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff .
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure , our liking for sweet , fat and proteins , which in turn explains a lot of popular foods , from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs .
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
The peacock &apos;s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
No , the peacock &apos;s tail results from the mating choices made by peahens .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
Darwin himself , by the way , had no doubts that the peacock &apos;s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen .
He actually used that word .
Now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .
Beauty is nature &apos;s way of acting at a distance , so to speak .
I mean , you can &apos;t expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape .
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
So evolution &apos;s trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure , the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved .
This landscape shows up today on calendars , on postcards , in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand .
It &apos;s a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees .
The trees , by the way , are often preferred if they fork near the ground , that is to say , if they &apos;re trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix .
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it .
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful , even by people in countries that don &apos;t have it .
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience .
But , someone might argue , that &apos;s natural beauty .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
And once again , I &apos;d like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet .
Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old , along with a few small , realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period .
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and crafts fair , as well as ochre body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries , until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single , thin stone blades , sometimes rounded ovals , but often in what are to our eyes an arresting , symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form .
These Acheulian hand axes -- they &apos;re named after St. Acheul in France , where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands , scattered across Asia , Europe and Africa , almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed .
Now , the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can &apos;t have been made for butchering animals .
And the plot really thickens when you realize that , unlike other pleistocene tools , the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges .
And some , in any event , are too big to use for butchery .
Their symmetry , their attractive materials and , above all , their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
So what were these ancient -- I mean , they &apos;re ancient , they &apos;re foreign , but they &apos;re at the same time somehow familiar .
What were these artifacts for ?
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call &quot; fitness signals &quot; -- that is to say , displays that are performances like the peacock &apos;s tail , except that , unlike hair and feathers , the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted .
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability , conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .
Over tens of thousands of generations , such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable .
You know , it &apos;s an old line , but it has been shown to work -- &quot; Why don &apos;t you come up to my cave , so I can show you my hand axes ? &quot;
Except , of course , what &apos;s interesting about this is that we can &apos;t be sure how that idea was conveyed , because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language .
It &apos;s hard to grasp , but it &apos;s an incredible fact .
This object was made by a hominid ancestor , Homo erectus or Homo ergaster , between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language .
Stretching over a million years , the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history .
By the end of the hand axe epic , Homo sapiens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by , who knows , telling jokes , storytelling , dancing , or hairstyling .
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
For us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
But still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances .
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall , human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
We find beauty in something done well .
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone , don &apos;t be so sure it &apos;s just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful .
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it , even before they could put their love into words .
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
It &apos;s a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors .
Our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotion in art , to the beauty of music , to the night sky , will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists .
Thank you .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
The question is , Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown ?
Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture -- The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx .
Where &apos;d that come from ?
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language .
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information .
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries .
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
Also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- &quot; sh . &quot;
It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; something &quot; just like the the English word &quot; something &quot; -- some undefined , unknown thing .
Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; al . &quot;
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs .
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; sh &quot; sound .
So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; ck &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai .
Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
X is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in Spanish .
And I thought that was worth sharing .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table -- peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
And I said , &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
And she told me , she said , &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot;
The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
It all started back in 1977 .
I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
And I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses -- and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot;
I said , &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; A job . &quot;
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experimental education program .
It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention -- kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the &apos; 70s -- and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot;
Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
Chris , could you stand up and let them see you -- a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
This film is called &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot;
He proposed the film to me -- it &apos;s a great title .
He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot;
But the film has really gone places .
Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
That &apos;s the smile I use -- that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
&quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot;
You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does , like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
I &apos;ll make something -- I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive .
And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it -- even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
There are four countries around the board .
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich ; some are poor .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these crises , we have -- let &apos;s see -- ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
So I also have in the game a saboteur -- some child -- it &apos;s basically a troublemaker -- and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; The Art of War . &quot;
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old -- and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow -- at first they do -- the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
John Hunter : I offered them a -- Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
And so I apologize to them as well .
I say , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot;
It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
We were all upset with her , &quot; Why are you doing this ?
This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot;
This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
But come to find out , a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them , I put in a letter .
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot;
There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
&quot; Sure . &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
One week he said , &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot;
And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
He says , &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; We have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And the game is won .
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about warfare .
But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You think I &apos;ve lost my way , and somebody &apos;s going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .
I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years .
And in that time , I have seen a lot of changes .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English .
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi .
And one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses -- medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
How did those students get all that knowledge ?
Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
It &apos;s not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
But sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
A language dies every 14 days .
Now , at the same time , English is the undisputed global language .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
But I do know that I &apos;ve seen a lot of changes .
When I first came out to the Gulf , I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
But nevertheless , I was recruited by the British Council , along with about 25 other teachers .
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait .
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
And of course , the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .
Okay .
Now this is the major change that I &apos;ve seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today .
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum , and no longer the sole domain of mother England , it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth .
And why not ?
After all , the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
But if you &apos;re not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
We put a stop sign , and we stop them in their tracks .
They can &apos;t pursue their dream any longer , &apos; til they get English .
Now let me put it this way : if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would I stop him from entering my British University ?
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough .
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
&quot; But , &quot; I hear you say , &quot; what about the research ?
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
So the books are in English , the journals are done in English , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to translation ?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age , there was lots of translation then .
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic , into Persian , and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages .
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong ; I am not against teaching English , all you English teachers out there .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am against using it as a barrier .
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English , or Chinese ?
We need more than that . Where do we draw the line ?
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English , which is quite arbitrary .
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today &apos;s intelligentsia stand did not have to have English , they didn &apos;t have to pass an English test .
Case in point , Einstein .
He , by the way , was considered remedial at school because he was , in fact , dyslexic .
But fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an English test .
Because they didn &apos;t start until 1964 with TOEFL , the American test of English .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
Now you might think , you and me , &quot; Those fees aren &apos;t bad , they &apos;re okay , &quot; but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently : &quot; Education : The Great Divide . &quot;
Now I get it , I understand why people would want to focus on English .
They want to give their children the best chance in life .
And to do that , they need a Western education .
Because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities , that I put on earlier .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
Let me tell you a story about two scientists , two English scientists .
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
They really didn &apos;t know what to do , until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb , whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
But if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
It &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad , we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know , and they know it in their own language .
When a language dies , we don &apos;t know what we lose with that language .
This is -- I don &apos;t know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn &apos;t study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the kerosene lamp , it had smoke and it damaged his eyes .
And anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home .
When he received his award , he said these lovely words : &quot; The children can lead Africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot;
A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
People who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or metaphorical , cannot pass our exams , and we can never know what they know .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
Thank you very much .
John Hockenberry : It &apos;s great to be here with you , Tom .
And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work .
In you work there &apos;s always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force .
Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work ?
Tom Shannon : Yeah , the subject matter that I &apos;m looking for , it &apos;s usually to solve a question .
I had the question popped into my head : What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres ?
And in proportion , what would the size of the sphere and the length , and what would the taper be to the Earth ?
And so I went about and made that sculpture , turning it out of solid bronze .
And I did one that was about 35 feet long .
The sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end .
And so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other .
JH : Is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
And I &apos;m wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces .
TS : Well , like the magnetically levitated objects -- like that silver one there , that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets , trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground .
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .
JH : Now is this electromagnetic here , or are these static ?
TS : Those are permanent magnets , yeah .
JH : Because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise .
TS : Yeah .
It &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
JH : I agree .
TS : The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism , so it &apos;s a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything .
The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth &apos;s magnetic field protects us from the sun .
So there &apos;s this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe .
But with the pendulum , it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up .
My sculptures are normally very simplified .
I try to refine them down to very simple forms .
But the paintings become very complex , because I think the fields that are supporting them , they &apos;re billowing , and they &apos;re interpenetrating , and they &apos;re interference patterns .
JH : And they &apos;re non-deterministic .
I mean , you don &apos;t know necessarily where you &apos;re headed when you begin , even though the forces can be calculated .
So the evolution of this -- I gather this isn &apos;t your first pendulum .
TS : No .
TS : The first one I did was in the late 70 &apos;s , and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it .
I threw it into an orbit , and it only had one color , and when it got to the center , the paint kept running out , so I had to run in there , didn &apos;t have any control over the spigot remotely .
So that told me right away : I need a remote control device .
But then I started dreaming of having six colors .
I sort of think about it as the DNA -- these colors , the red , blue , yellow , the primary colors and white and black .
And if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces , which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appearing .
JH : It looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
TS : Yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of canvases .
I &apos;ll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here .
I want to just say -- so this is Jack , Nick and Louie .
JH : Thanks guys .
TS : So here are the -- JH : All right , I &apos;ll get out of the way here .
TS : I &apos;m just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody &apos;s shoes in the front .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
I &apos;m doing this as a demo , and it &apos;s more playful , but inevitably , all of this can be used .
I can redeem this painting , just continuing on , doing layers upon layers .
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks , and I &apos;m contemplating it , and I &apos;ll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the depth of it .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio-controlled airplane valves .
TS : Yes , they &apos;re servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes .
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom .
You can always be changing colors , put aluminum paint , or I could put anything into this .
It could be tomato sauce , or anything could be dispensed -- sand , powders or anything like that .
JH : So many forces there .
You &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the centrifugal force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
Each of these beautiful paintings , are they images in and of themselves , or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas ?
TS : Well , this painting here , I wanted to do something very simple , a simple , iconic image of two ripples interfering .
So the one on the right was done first , and then the one on the left was done over it .
And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before .
And then when I did the second one , it really disturbed the piece -- these big blue lines crashing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap .
There are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes .
What it &apos;s also about , just the little events , the events of the interpenetration of -- JH : Two stars , or -- TS : Two things that happened -- there &apos;s an interference pattern , and then a third thing happens .
There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening , and I &apos;m very interested in that .
Like the occurrence of moire patterns .
Like this green one , this is a painting I did about 10 years ago , but it has some -- see , in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery .
And that &apos;s something that in painting I &apos;ve never seen done .
I &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
JH : Is that a literal part of the image , or is my eye making that interference pattern -- is my eye completing that interference pattern ?
TS : It is the paint actually , makes it real .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
If I throw a very concentric circle , or concentric ellipse , it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines , which get closer and closer together , which describes how gravity works .
There &apos;s something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy .
And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology .
Some of these paintings , when you look at them very close , odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles , elephants .
There are lots of things that appear .
When you look into it , it &apos;s sort of like looking at cloud patterns , but sometimes they &apos;re very modeled and highly rendered .
And then there are all these forms that we don &apos;t know what they are , but they &apos;re equally well-resolved and complex .
So I think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we &apos;re familiar with in biology , it &apos;s also making other forms that we &apos;re not familiar with .
And maybe it &apos;s the kind of forms we &apos;ll discover underneath the surface of Mars , where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface .
JH : Oh , let &apos;s hope so . Oh , my God , let &apos;s .
Oh , please , yes . Oh , I &apos;m so there .
You know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- I suppose it &apos;s an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life .
Is that relevant to your work ?
TS : As it turns out , this device kind of comes in handy , because I don &apos;t have to have the fine motor skills to do , that I can operate slides , which is more of a mental process .
I &apos;m looking at it and making decisions : It needs more red , it needs more blue , it needs a different shape .
And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much , much simpler way .
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
I guess Parkinson &apos;s kind of creeps up over the years , but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms .
In my case , my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also .
I &apos;m left-handed , and so I draw .
All my creations really start on small drawings , which I have thousands of , and it &apos;s my way of just thinking .
I draw with a simple pencil , and at first , the Parkinson &apos;s was really upsetting , because I couldn &apos;t get the pencil to stand still .
JH : So you &apos;re not a gatekeeper for these forces .
You don &apos;t think of yourself as the master of these forces .
You think of yourself as the servant .
TS : Nature is -- well , it &apos;s a godsend .
It just has so much in it .
And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature , humans are of the universe .
The universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe .
And we are expressions of the universe , basically .
As humans , ultimately being part of the universe , we &apos;re kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .
And to interface with it , with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do , giving them pigment and paint just like an artist , it &apos;s a good ally .
It &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
JH : Well , I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elemental force gets revealed , and that &apos;s the beauty here .
Tom , thank you so much . It &apos;s been really , really great .
TS : Thank you , John .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
This is a floppy disk -- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
And we actually know where Brain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot;
And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
So here standing up is Basit .
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
And we found it right over here three seconds ago -- the previous one , six seconds ago .
And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
It &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers -- somebody else &apos;s computers -- to these guys .
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
Same thing with every single password and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
And they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another -- moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exploit file .
Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file -- well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
But just keep staring at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
So obviously I Googled for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg -- he &apos;s in his early 20s -- about his cat , about his girlfriend .
And he drives a very nice car .
In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
And he put blogged images about the car accident -- that &apos;s his Mercedes -- right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; I rest my case . &quot;
So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
This is what runs everything around us .
PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around -- everything is being run by computers .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reliant on these computers working .
We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
It &apos;s actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
Now I told you -- I love the Internet . I do .
Think about all the services we have online .
Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs -- these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
Thank you very much .
Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot;
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; Julian Po . &quot;
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
No one is exactly shocked .
But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
Were we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
It might give them pause .
Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City .
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
&quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
There is no equality in the United States .
&#91; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Marriage &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Freedom &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
&#91; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
I want to take the project across the country .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; gays &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box .
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
Can you quantify your openness ?
Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; Grey . &quot;
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
Thank you .
So , I &apos;d like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .
But before I do that , I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics , which require huge amounts of energy to create and , because of their disposal issues , are slowly poisoning our planet .
I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years .
Not like that .
We &apos;re using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials , which perform a lot like plastics during their use , but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives .
But first , I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category .
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam , but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff .
In a single cubic foot of this material -- about what would come around your computer or large television -- you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol .
Yet , after just a few weeks of use , you &apos;ll throw this material in the trash .
And this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops .
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
The EPA estimates , in the United States , by volume , this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills .
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river .
If it &apos;s not picked up by a human , like me and you , it &apos;ll stay there for thousands and thousands of years .
Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
They &apos;re basically fouling up Earth &apos;s respiratory and circulatory systems .
And because these materials are so prolific , because they &apos;re found in so many places , there &apos;s one other place you &apos;ll find this material , styrene , which is made from benzene , a known carcinogen .
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
So , for all these reasons , I think we need better materials , and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials .
The first is feedstocks .
Today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
We recognize this is a finite resource , and it &apos;s simply crazy to do this , to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package .
Second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials .
I say far less , because 10 percent isn &apos;t going to cut it .
We should be talking about half , a quarter , one-tenth the energy content .
And lastly , and I think perhaps most importantly , we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature &apos;s recycling system .
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years .
I fit into it , you fit into it , and a hundred years tops , my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing .
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years .
This is crazy .
But nature provides us with a really good model here .
When a tree &apos;s done using its leaves -- its solar collectors , these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season , it doesn &apos;t pack them up , take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves .
It just drops them , the shortest distance possible , to the forest floor , where they &apos;re actually upcycled into next year &apos;s topsoil .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
And what we &apos;ve discovered is , by using a part of the mushroom you &apos;ve probably never seen -- analogous to its root structure ; it &apos;s called mycelium -- we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics .
Now , mycelium is an amazing material , because it &apos;s a self-assembling material .
It actually takes things we would consider waste -- things like seed husks or woody biomass -- and can transform them into a chitinous polymer , which you can form into almost any shape .
In our process , we basically use it as a glue .
And by using mycelium as a glue , you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry , and you can create materials with many different properties , materials that are insulating , fire-resistant , moisture-resistant , vapor-resistant -- materials that can absorb impacts , that can absorb acoustical impacts .
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts , not petroleum .
And because they &apos;re made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
So I &apos;d like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials .
The first is selecting a feedstock , preferably something that &apos;s regional , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool , physically filling an enclosure , a mold , in whatever shape you want to get .
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles , and that &apos;s where the magic happens , because the organism is doing the work in this process , not the equipment .
The final step is , of course , the product , whether it &apos;s a packaging material , a table top , or building block .
Our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production .
So we &apos;ve created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts .
If you &apos;re in China , you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull .
If you &apos;re in Northern Europe or North America , you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .
We then process these husks with some basic equipment .
And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale .
So what you &apos;re seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas , in this case .
It &apos;s a waste product .
And what they &apos;re doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system , which cleans , cooks , cools and pasteurizes these materials , while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium .
This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape , though today we &apos;re making corner blocks .
And it &apos;s when this lid goes on the part , that the magic really starts .
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .
It &apos;ll actually begin to digest these wastes and , over the next five days , assemble them into biocomposites .
Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark , quietly self-assembling materials -- and everything from building materials to , in this case , a packaging corner block .
So I &apos;ve said a number of times that we grow materials .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to picture how that happens .
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse .
And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen , because , over the five-day period , what they do is extend out and through this material , using the energy that &apos;s contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix .
This matrix self-assembles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
And what parts of the seed husk we don &apos;t digest , actually become part of the final , physical composite .
So in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
The last step , of course , is application .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment .
They used to use a plastic packaging buffer , but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material .
Best of all , when it gets to the customer , it &apos;s not trash .
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing , and it &apos;s going to improve the local soil .
So , why mycelium ?
The first reason is local open feedstocks .
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls , because you have multiple choices .
The next is self-assembly , because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process .
You don &apos;t need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility .
So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world .
Biological yield is really important .
And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product , even the parts that aren &apos;t digested become part of the structure , we &apos;re getting incredible yield rates .
Natural polymers , well ... I think that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years , in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans .
They &apos;re not going to clog up Earth &apos;s ecosystems . They work great .
And while , today , we can practically guarantee that yesterday &apos;s packaging is going to be here in 10,000 years , what I want to guarantee is that in 10,000 years , our descendants , our children &apos;s children , will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth .
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .
I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon , which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it .
My own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather accidentally .
I had bought a copy of this book , &quot; The Universe and Dr. Einstein &quot; -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle .
A few years after that , in Bangalore , I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night , and I picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
And as it happened , I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .
And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could partake in the joy of science , and also the joy of communicating it to others .
And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes , detectors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail .
So it took me from places like Chile -- the Atacama Desert in Chile -- to Siberia , to underground mines in the Japanese Alps , in Northern America , all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole .
And today I would like to share with you some images , some stories of these trips .
I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe .
And I first begin with a pie chart -- and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos .
All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we &apos;re all made of -- and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which permeates the fabric of space-time , that makes up another 73 percent .
So if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our exploration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
And most of the experiments , telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy .
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors .
And the reason why they have to go underground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth , the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays , ambient radio activity , even our own bodies . You might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment .
So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector .
And I went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there -- this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960 .
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
And the miners in the early part of the last century worked , literally , in candlelight .
And today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
And , among other things , they &apos;re looking for dark matter .
There is another way to search for dark matter , which is indirectly .
If dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos .
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules .
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light , a flash of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then , indirectly , something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .
But you need very , very large volumes of water in order to do this .
You need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard .
This is Lake Baikal .
It is the largest lake in the world . It &apos;s 800 km long .
It &apos;s about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
And what the Russians are doing is they &apos;re building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light .
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there .
This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And the line of black dots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice camp where the physicists are working .
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don &apos;t have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and submersibles to do their work .
So they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter .
They have to drill holes in the ice , dive down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice melts .
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it &apos;s full of cracks .
And you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire sea-like lake underneath , moving .
I still don &apos;t understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working .
And these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
And just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a shoestring budget .
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack .
And it &apos;s that basic , but they do this every year .
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile , to see something called The Very Large Telescope .
The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively .
I can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope .
And you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
And these telescopes , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
And the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror .
Each mirror , there are four of them , is made of a single piece of glass , a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic , that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is &#91; to &#93; imagine a city like Paris , with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower , if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy , you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high .
And that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert .
The dry air is really good for telescopes , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies .
Finally , I want to take you to Antarctica .
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
This is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
Some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in Antarctica .
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight , which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere , the upper stratosphere , 40 km up .
And that &apos;s where they do their experiments , and then the balloon , the payload , is brought down .
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica .
That &apos;s an American C-17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And I don &apos;t know if you can read the lettering , but it says , &quot; Ivan the Terribus . &quot;
And that &apos;s taking us to McMurdo .
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
And you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole .
Because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
This is McMurdo itself . About a thousand people work here in summer , and about 200 in winter when it &apos;s completely dark for six months .
I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .
This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km .
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
So you &apos;re using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
And the engineers , the technicians , the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf , because Antarctica -- I won &apos;t go into the reasons why -- but it &apos;s one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches , except for the weather .
The weather , as you can imagine , this is summer , and you &apos;re standing on 200 ft of ice .
And there &apos;s a volcano behind , which has glaciers at the very top .
And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric , parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium .
And that process takes about two hours .
And the weather can change as they &apos;re putting together this whole assembly .
For instance , here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with helium .
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium .
Now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station .
And this particular balloon , because it has to launch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge balloon .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
In order to minimize the weight , it &apos;s very thin , it &apos;s as thin as a sandwich wrapper .
And if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in Texas .
Here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get barefoot into the boxes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
That &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
Here &apos;s the balloon being filled up with helium , and you can see it &apos;s a gorgeous sight .
Here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end .
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side , and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute , and then the parachute is then connected to the payload .
And remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
They &apos;re wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
Radio : Okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
Anil Ananthaswamy : And I &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
This is an observatory in the Himalayas , in Ladakh in India .
And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side .
And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being .
And both require silence of some sort .
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes , the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it &apos;s silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
And it was very obvious that , if we destroy these silent places on Earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space .
Thank you .
My story is a little bit about war .
It &apos;s about disillusionment .
It &apos;s about death .
And it &apos;s about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .
And perhaps also , there &apos;s a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up , fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century .
I don &apos;t believe in straightforward narratives .
I don &apos;t believe in a life or history written as decision &quot; A &quot; led to consequence &quot; B &quot; led to consequence &quot; C &quot; -- these neat narratives that we &apos;re presented with , and that perhaps we encourage in each other .
I believe in randomness , and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .
I &apos;m colorblind .
I was born unable to see most colors .
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time , and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes .
And I &apos;d always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy .
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside .
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot .
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot , and sure enough , I failed .
I couldn &apos;t see all the blinking different lights , So I had to choose another career , and this was in fact relatively easy for me , because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood , which was international relations .
As a child , I read the newspaper thoroughly .
I was fascinated by the Cold War , by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles , the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
in Angola or Afghanistan .
These things really interested me .
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat .
And I , one day , I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said , &quot; Daddy , I want to be a diplomat . &quot;
And he turned to me , and he said , &quot; Carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . &quot;
And my ambition was sealed .
In 1989 , I entered the British Foreign Service .
That year , 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat , and 20 of us succeeded .
And as those numbers suggest , I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world .
Being a diplomat , then and now , is an incredible job , and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it .
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events .
I traveled to the Gaza Strip .
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry .
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary .
I met Yasser Arafat .
I negotiated with Saddam &apos;s diplomats at the U.N.
Later , I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban .
And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan , surrounded by my Special Forces escort , who , themselves , had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines , because it was so dangerous .
And that was exciting -- that was fun .
It was really interesting .
And it &apos;s a great cadre of people , incredibly close-knit community of people .
And the pinnacle of my career , as it turned out , was when I was posted to New York .
I &apos;d already served in Germany , Norway , various other places , but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation .
And my responsibility was the Middle East , which was my specialty .
And there , I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process , the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later , if you wish -- but above all , my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject , and I was steeped in the issue .
And anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy .
We went through several wars during my time in New York .
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time .
So it was kind of the best of time , worst of times kind of experience .
I lived the high-life .
Although I worked very long hours , I lived in a penthouse in Union Square .
I was a single British diplomat in New York City ; you can imagine what that might have meant .
I had a good time .
But in 2002 , when my tour came to an end , I decided I wasn &apos;t going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London .
I decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the New School , Bruce .
In some inchoate , inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work , with me .
I was exhausted , and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn &apos;t quite put my finger on .
And I decided to take some time out from work .
The Foreign Office was very generous .
You could take these special unpaid leave , as they called them , and yet remain part of the diplomatic service , but not actually do any work .
It was nice .
And eventually , I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo , which was then under U.N. administration .
And two things happened in Kosovo , which kind of , again , shows the randomness of life , because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage .
But they were random things .
One was that , in the summer of 2004 , the British government , somewhat reluctantly , decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War , a very limited subject .
And I testified to that inquiry in secret .
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years I &apos;d read it .
And indeed , our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq &apos;s WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors , let alone to us .
Secondly , the government had ignored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still .
The third reason , I won &apos;t go into .
But anyway , I gave that testimony , and that presented me with a crisis .
What was I going to do ?
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues , of my ministers , who had , in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood .
And so I was in crisis .
And this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
I moaned about it , I hesitated , I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife , and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service .
I felt -- there &apos;s a scene in the Al Pacino movie &quot; The Insider , &quot; which you may know , where he goes back to CBS after they &apos;ve let him down over the tobacco guy , and he goes , &quot; You know , I just can &apos;t do this anymore . Something &apos;s broken . &quot;
And it was like that for me . I love that movie .
I felt just something &apos;s broken .
I can &apos;t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them .
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .
And it was a very , very uncomfortable , unpleasant feeling .
And I started to fall .
And today , that fall hasn &apos;t stopped ; I &apos;m still falling .
But , in a way , I &apos;ve got used to the sensation of it .
And in a way , I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff , wondering what to do .
A second thing happened in Kosovo , which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water , forgive me .
A second thing happened in Kosovo , which kind of delivered the answer , which I couldn &apos;t really answer , which is , &quot; What do I do with my life ? &quot;
I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat , to be serving my country .
I wanted to be an ambassador , and my mentors , my heroes , people who got to the top of my profession , and here I was throwing it all away .
A lot of my friends were still in it .
My pension was in it .
And I gave it up .
And what was I going to do ?
And that year , in Kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which I saw .
In March 2004 , there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo .
18 people were killed .
It was anarchy .
And it &apos;s a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can &apos;t stop that rampaging mob who &apos;s coming down the street .
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they &apos;ve had enough burning and killing .
And that is not a very nice feeling to see , and I saw it .
And I went through it . I went through those mobs .
And with my Albanian friends , we tried to stop it , but we failed .
And that riot taught me something , which isn &apos;t immediately obvious and it &apos;s kind of a complicated story .
But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future .
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then , and the Kosovo government , let alone the Kosovo people , were not actually participating in those talks .
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo , and the Kosovars weren &apos;t part of it .
And funnily enough , they were frustrated about that .
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration .
It wasn &apos;t the only reason , and life is not simple , one reason narratives .
It was a complicated thing , and I &apos;m not pretending it was more simple than it was .
But that was one of the reasons .
And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise , it gave my wife the inspiration .
She said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you advise the Kosovars ?
Why don &apos;t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &quot;
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
They were not allowed diplomats .
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process , which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo .
And so that was the idea .
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat , the world &apos;s first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot .
And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo .
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him , &quot; Look , I &apos;m proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy .
I know this stuff . It &apos;s what I do . Why don &apos;t I come and help you ? &quot;
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said , &quot; Yes , Carne . Come . &quot;
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government .
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo .
And Kosovo became independent .
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we &apos;re advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them -- and I &apos;m not big on definitions .
We &apos;re advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island .
We &apos;re advising the Burmese opposition , the government of Southern Sudan , which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years .
We &apos;re advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara , who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession .
We &apos;re advising various island states in the climate change negotiations , which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen .
There &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when I was beginning Independent Diplomat , I went to a party in the House of Lords , which is a ridiculous place , but I was holding my drink like this , and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
And we started talking , and he said -- I told him what I was doing , and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York .
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York .
And he said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you see my colleagues in New York ? &quot;
And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? What If ! , which some of you have probably heard of .
And one thing led to another , and I ended up having a desk in ? What If ! in New York , when I started Independent Diplomat .
And watching ? What If !
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara .
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy , like business , is a business of solving problems , and yet the word innovation doesn &apos;t exist in diplomacy ; it &apos;s all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they &apos;ve always done things .
And Independent Diplomat , today , tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ? What If ! .
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office .
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think .
And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we &apos;re dealing with , but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients .
It &apos;s not easy , because our clients , by definition , are having a difficult time , diplomatically .
There are , I don &apos;t know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they &apos;re the same thing .
The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing , and I recommend it .
And it &apos;s a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump .
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is fragmenting .
States mean less than they used to , and the power of the state is declining .
That means the power of others things is rising .
Those other things are called non-state actors .
They may be corporations , they may be mafiosi , they may be nice NGOs , they may anything , any number of things .
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .
If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world , then that means , who is left to deal with them , who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ?
Us .
If they can &apos;t do it , who &apos;s left to deal with it ?
We have no choice but to embrace that reality .
What this means is it &apos;s no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global affairs , or chaos in Somalia , or what &apos;s going on in Burma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia .
Ask me how later , particularly if you eat fish , interestingly enough , but that connection is there .
We are all intimately connected .
And this isn &apos;t just Tom Friedman , it &apos;s actually provable in case after case after case .
What that means is , instead of asking your politicians to do things , you have to look to yourself to do things .
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way .
There aren &apos;t neat examples , but one example is this : the way the world is changing is embodied in what &apos;s going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council .
The U.N. was established in 1945 .
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict .
Today , 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states , involving non-state parties -- guerillas , separatists , terrorists , if you want to call them that , people who are not normal governments , who are not normal states .
That is the state of the world today .
When I realized this , and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars , and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren &apos;t actually there , weren &apos;t actually invited to give their views to the Security Council , I thought , this is wrong .
Something &apos;s got to be done about this .
So I started off in a traditional mode .
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council .
We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks , the Ethiopians , the Israelis -- you name them , we went to see them -- the secretary general , all of them , and said , &quot; This is all wrong .
This is terrible that you don &apos;t consult these people who are actually affected .
You &apos;ve got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think .
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think .
It &apos;ll be great . You can have an exchange .
You can actually incorporate these people &apos;s views into your decisions , which means your decisions will be more effective and durable . &quot;
Super-logical , you would think .
I mean , incredibly logical . So obvious , anybody could get it .
And of course , everybody got it . Everybody went , &quot; Yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
Come back to us in maybe six months . &quot;
And of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything .
The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago , when I was there 10 years ago .
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought , what can we do about it .
And I thought , I &apos;m buggered if I &apos;m going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done .
So what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re actually going to set up these meetings ourselves .
So now , Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council .
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups , the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots , rebels from Aceh , and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council , and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want .
So there &apos;s actually a conversation , which has never before happened .
And of course , describing all this , any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult , and I entirely agree with you .
The chances of failure are very high , but it certainly won &apos;t happen if we don &apos;t try to make it happen .
And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today , and I think that outputs is what matters , not process , not technology , frankly , so much either .
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad remains in power .
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran .
You &apos;ve got to look at the outputs , and you got to say to yourself , &quot; What can I do to produce that particular output ? &quot;
That is the politics of the 21st century , and in a way , Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation , that change , that is happening to all of us .
That &apos;s my story . Thanks .
Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about 100 years ago .
The thought that you wouldn &apos;t want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
They thought , &quot; Who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot;
And so , in fact , he actually set about doing a variety of things .
Built the Tesla coil . This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s .
And the idea was , it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth .
We &apos;ll never know if this stuff worked . Actually , I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s .
But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much .
I mean , think about how much we love this .
If you just walk outside , there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world , putting up wires to get power from where it &apos;s created to where it &apos;s used .
The other thing is , we love batteries .
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us , there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year for power that , generally speaking , is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power .
So , before I got here , I thought , &quot; You know , I am from North America .
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States . &quot;
So I thought I &apos;d better look it up first .
So definition number six is the North American definition of the word &quot; suck . &quot;
Wires suck , they really do .
Think about it . Whether that &apos;s you in that picture or something under your desk .
The other thing is , batteries suck too .
And they really , really do .
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
40 billion of these things built .
This is what happens .
They fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
So when you talk about expensive power , the cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds .
Think about that .
The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that .
So fortunately , one of the other definitions of &quot; suck &quot; that was in there , it does create a vacuum .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance .
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters .
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency -- by the way , that &apos;s still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be , to do the same thing .
But were able to light that , and do it very successfully .
This was actually the experiment . So you can see the coils were somewhat larger .
The light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint .
This all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife &apos;s cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power .
And he was thinking , &quot; With all the electricity that &apos;s out there in the walls , why couldn &apos;t some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep ? &quot;
And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer .
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
And those two coils of wire are really , really close to each other , and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly , only over a very short distance .
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
It &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award , which is nicknamed the Genius Award , last September , for his discovery .
So how does it work ?
Imagine a coil . For those of you that are engineers , there &apos;s a capacitor attached to it too .
And if you can cause that coil to resonate , what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency , by the way .
And if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called strongly couple , and transfer magnetic energy between them .
And then what you do is , you start out with electricity , turn it into magnetic field , take that magnetic field , turn it back into electricity , and then you can use it .
Number one question I get asked .
I mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
You know . What about safety ?
The first thing is this is not a &quot; radiative &quot; technology .
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
There aren &apos;t electric fields here . It &apos;s a magnetic field .
It stays within either what we call the source , or within the device .
And actually , the magnetic fields we &apos;re using are basically about the same as the Earth &apos;s magnetic field .
We live in a magnetic field .
And the other thing that &apos;s pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do .
They &apos;ve pretty much set field exposure limits , which all of the things in the stuff I &apos;ll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
Those cords under your desk , I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries .
There are industrial applications .
And then finally , electric vehicles .
These electric cars are beautiful .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
Imagine driving into your garage -- we &apos;ve built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage , and the car charges itself , because there is a mat on the floor that &apos;s plugged into the wall .
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
Then there &apos;s all kinds of other applications . Implanted medical devices , where people don &apos;t have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
So what I &apos;d like to do is take a couple minutes and show you , actually , how it works .
And what I &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field .
We put one on the back of the television set .
By the way , I do make it look a little bit easier than it is .
There &apos;s lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it .
But then what &apos;s going to happen is , it will create a field .
It will cause one to get created on the other side .
And if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
The 10 seconds actually are because we -- I don &apos;t know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord .
Generally , you have to go over and hit the button . So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
It causes one to be created out here .
And as I said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
This is a commercially -- available color television set .
Imagine , you get one of these things . You want to hang them on the wall .
How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
Think about it . You don &apos;t want those ugly cords coming down .
Imagine if you can get rid of it .
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety .
So , there is nothing going on . I &apos;m okay .
And I &apos;ll do it again , just for safety &apos;s sake .
Almost immediately , though , people ask , &quot; How small can you make this ? Can you make this small enough ? &quot;
Because remember Dr. Soljacic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cellphone beeping .
So , I wanted to show you something .
We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
This a Google G1 .
You know , it &apos;s the latest thing that &apos;s come out .
It runs the Android operating system .
I think I heard somebody talk about that before .
It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it .
And if I can get the camera -- okay , great -- you &apos;ll see , as I get sort of close ...
you &apos;re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados .
So , you know they don &apos;t make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones .
So we put a little sleeve on the back , but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center .
And Nokia as well .
You &apos;ll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back , to do that , and it probably beeps , actually , as it goes on as well .
But they typically use it to light up the screen .
So , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
They could go in the floor . They could go , actually , underneath your desktop .
So that when you walk in or you come in from home , if you carry a purse , it works in your purse .
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
And think of what that would do for you .
So I think in closing , sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine , I thought I &apos;d put up one more slide .
And for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . &quot;
So , thank you very much .
If you really want to understand the problem that we &apos;re facing with the oceans , you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics .
We can &apos;t solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way .
So I &apos;m going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
We &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
And then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me , you know , &quot; What do you worry about the most ?
What frightens you ? &quot;
for me , it &apos;s ocean acidification .
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So I will spend a little time at the end .
I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room .
And I think we all found it , simultaneously , an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience .
I sat in this large negotiation hall , at one point , for three or four hours , without hearing the word &quot; oceans &quot; one time .
It really wasn &apos;t on the radar screen .
The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states , the low-lying island states .
And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like Kiribati and Nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
You know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .
It &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don &apos;t have a clear target ?
Now , you &apos;ve heard about &quot; two degrees &quot; : that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees .
But there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
We &apos;ve also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Should it be 450 ? Should it be 400 ?
There &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
Most of the science that is behind these numbers , these potential targets , is based on studies on land .
And I would say , for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be , we would argue that they must be much lower .
You know , from an oceanic perspective , 450 is way too high .
Now there &apos;s compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350 .
We are , right now , at 390 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere .
We &apos;re not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450 , so we &apos;ve got to accept we &apos;re going to do an overshoot , and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what &apos;s the pathway back to 350 .
Now , why is this so complicated ?
Why don &apos;t we know some of these things a little bit better ?
Well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
There &apos;s all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
There &apos;s air-sea interactions .
Here in Galapagos , we &apos;re affected by El Ninos and La Nina .
But the entire planet warms up when there &apos;s a big El Nino .
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
That changes our climate .
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
And we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
And then we have the human-induced causes of climate change as well .
We &apos;re changing the characteristics of the surface of the land , the reflectivity .
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .
So here &apos;s the thing . It sounds like a simple question .
Is CO2 produced by man &apos;s activities causing the planet to warm up ?
But to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change .
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things .
You know , thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes .
And we &apos;ve got it worked out , and we can say , &quot; Yes , CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now . &quot;
Now , we have many ways to study natural variability .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change , right .
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO2 double what it is today .
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done with this ship .
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle .
It looks downright tropical there .
One day where we had calm seas and sun , which was the reason I could get off the ship .
Most of the time it looked like this .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
and winds averaging about 40 knots for most of the voyage and up to 70 or 80 knots .
So that trip just ended , and I can &apos;t show you too many results from that right now , but we &apos;ll go back one more year , to another drilling expedition I &apos;ve been involved in .
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish .
It &apos;s the ANDRILL project .
And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet .
This is a crazy thing , this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm , drilling at temperatures of minus 40 .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
That &apos;s the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .
So , this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica .
Now , West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as 2,000 meters deep .
So that ice sheet is partly floating , and it &apos;s exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about .
Because it &apos;s partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north .
When that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
So we drill back in time to see how often that &apos;s happened , and exactly how fast that ice can melt .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor .
So it &apos;s the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled .
It took about 10 years to put this project together .
And here &apos;s what we found .
Now , there &apos;s 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses .
But it turns out , you know , the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description .
You know , we saw this in the core samples as they came up .
We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there &apos;s gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand .
That &apos;s the kind of material in the deep sea .
It can only get there if it &apos;s carried out by ice .
So we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
This sediment is 100 percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants .
And these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
And we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water , between gravels and these plant sediments .
So what that means is , what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region , this ice shelf , melted back and formed anew about 35 times .
And this is in the past four million years .
This was completely unexpected .
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic .
In fact , the lore for many years has been , &quot; The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago , and it &apos;s been there ever since . &quot;
And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again , and sea level went up and down , six meters at a time .
What caused it ?
Well , we &apos;re pretty sure that it &apos;s very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica , just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth .
But here &apos;s the key thing : you know , the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold , that the planet warmed up enough -- and the number &apos;s about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade -- the planet warmed up enough that it became ...
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
And you know what ?
We &apos;ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica , the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , is starting to melt .
We do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century .
And it could be larger than that .
This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati , you know , where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
This is a bleached coral , coral that died during the 1982- &apos; 83 El Nino .
This is from Champion Island .
It &apos;s about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony .
And it &apos;s covered with algae . That &apos;s what happens .
When these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
And so , when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event , it leaves this indelible record .
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .
So one of the things thought of in the &apos; 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event .
And just so you know , 1982- &apos; 83 , that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos .
Then there was similar mortality in &apos; 97- &apos; 98 .
And what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events .
We saw no other mass mortality events .
So these events in our recent past really are unique .
So they &apos;re either just truly monster El Ninos , or they &apos;re just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming .
Either case , it &apos;s bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands .
Here &apos;s how we sample the corals .
This is actually Easter Island . Look at this monster .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
And it been growing for about 600 years .
Now , Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral .
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 -- and collected a little nugget and sent it to me .
And we started working on it , and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this .
So we have a diamond drill .
We &apos;re not killing the colony ; we &apos;re taking a small core sample out of the top .
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
So we &apos;ve done that all over the Eastern Pacific .
We &apos;re starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well .
I &apos;ll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands .
And we &apos;ve been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay .
That the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .
If you go on the ground there , it looks like this , and this is the grandaddy coral .
It &apos;s 11 meters in diameter , and we know that it started growing in the year 1584 .
Imagine that .
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters , until 1954 , when the earthquake happened .
Now the reason we know it &apos;s 1584 is that these corals have growth bands .
When you cut them , slice those cores in half and x-ray them , you see these light and dark bands .
Each one of those is a year .
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral , and there &apos;s a whole bunch of things we can do .
But in this case , we measured the different isotopes of oxygen .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .
In this example here , we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders , so we know the temperature of the water the coral &apos;s growing in .
Then after we harvest a coral , we measure this ratio , and now you can see , those curves match perfectly .
In this case , at these islands , you know , corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water .
And of course , our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here .
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
So , what we do : It &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years , Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
There &apos;s a whole family of curves here .
But what &apos;s happening : we &apos;re looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet .
And there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
We do similar things with ice cores .
We work with tree rings .
And that &apos;s how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century , right ?
And I chose this one because it &apos;s complicated and messy looking , right .
This is as messy as it gets .
You can see there &apos;s some signals there .
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
Some of them show greater variability .
But they all tell us what the natural variability is .
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere ; some are from the entire globe .
But here &apos;s what we can say : what &apos;s natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down .
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
And there is natural variability caused by the Sun , caused by El Ninos .
A century-scale , decadal-scale variability , and we know the magnitude ; it &apos;s about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade .
But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black .
And there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
You know , we &apos;ve warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century , and there &apos;s nothing that resembles what we &apos;ve seen in the last century .
You know , that &apos;s the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that &apos;s truly different .
So I &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
I like it as a component of global change to talk about , because , even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic , and I talk to that community fairly often , you cannot deny the simple physics of CO2 dissolving in the ocean .
You know , we &apos;re pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
Right now , about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea , right ?
And as it does so , it makes the ocean more acidic .
So , you cannot argue with that .
That is what &apos;s happening right now , and it &apos;s a very different issue than the global warming issue .
It has many consequences .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate -- plants and animals both .
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid .
So one of the things we &apos;re seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells .
At some point , as this transience , as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues , that material &apos;s actually going to start to dissolve .
And on coral reefs , where some of the main framework organisms disappear , we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .
But it &apos;s not just the carbonate producers that are affected .
There &apos;s many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean .
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean .
So , all of these things -- greater metabolic demands , reduced reproductive success , changes in respiration and metabolism .
You know , these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .
So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere , We used to do it just with ice cores , but in this case , we &apos;re going back 20 million years .
And we take samples of the sediment , and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean , and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere .
And here &apos;s the thing : you have to go back about 15 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were about what they are today .
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were double what they are today .
Now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , That &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that &apos;s going on right now .
So , Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year : &quot; The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release . &quot;
And I think that may very well be true , so I &apos;ll close with this .
You know , we do need the protected areas , absolutely , but for the sake of the oceans , we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions as soon as possible .
Thank you very much .
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it .
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is .
The 404 page is that .
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
It &apos;s effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can &apos;t find it .
And it serves you the 404 page .
It &apos;s inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
And I just want you to think a little bit about , remember for yourself , it &apos;s annoying when you hit this thing .
Because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
And that &apos;s where it &apos;s actually also interesting to think about , where does 404 come from ?
It &apos;s from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors , which , when I started digging into them , it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples couselor .
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey .
Yes .
But these things are everywhere .
They &apos;re on sites big , they &apos;re on sites small .
This is a global experience .
What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks .
And that &apos;s not a good experience when you &apos;re used to experiences like this .
You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone .
A 404 page is not what you &apos;re looking for .
You get that , and it &apos;s like a slap in the face .
Trying to think about how a 404 felt , and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there &apos;s the guy behind the counter and you &apos;re over there and there &apos;s no skim milk .
And you say , &quot; Hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot;
And they walk out from behind the counter and they &apos;ve got no pants on .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , I didn &apos;t want to see that . &quot;
That &apos;s the 404 feeling .
I mean , I &apos;ve heard about that .
So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator , and we had eight startups sitting around there .
And those startups are focused on what they are , not what they &apos;re not , until one day Athletepath , which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes , found this video .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
Renny Gleeson : You just ... no , he &apos;s not okay .
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place .
Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404 .
So this turned into a contest .
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
Stayhound , which helps you find pet sitters through your social network , commiserated with your pet .
Each one of them found this .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
At 4 : 04 the next day , we gave out $ 404 in cash .
And what they learned was that those little things , done right , actually matter , and that well-designed moments can build brands .
So you take a look out in the real world , and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself .
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
This is an error page , but what if this error page was also an opportunity ?
So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
Because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you &apos;re not , or it can remind me of why I should love you .
Thank you .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
When Patrick Henry , the governor of Virginia , said these words in 1775 , he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come .
At the time , these words were earmarked and targeted against the British , but over the last 200 years , they &apos;ve come to embody what many Westerners believe , that freedom is the most cherished value , and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them .
Who could blame them ?
Over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development .
In the United States over the past hundred years , incomes have increased 30 times , and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty .
Meanwhile , American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
It &apos;s no surprise , then , that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis , President Obama said , &quot; The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill .
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched . &quot;
Thus , there &apos;s understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth , liberal democracy , and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights .
However , to many who live in the emerging markets , this is an illusion , and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was signed in 1948 , was unanimously adopted , what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries , and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights .
This schism has only grown wider .
Today , many people who live in the emerging markets , where 90 percent of the world &apos;s population lives , believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point , and what is actually important is delivering on food , shelter , education and healthcare .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy .
Now , I know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; Well actually , this is hard to grasp , &quot; because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct .
But I ask you today , what would you do if you had to choose ?
What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote ?
Over the last 10 years , I &apos;ve had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries , many of them in the emerging markets , in Latin America , Asia , and my own continent of Africa .
I &apos;ve met with presidents , dissidents , policymakers , lawyers , teachers , doctors and the man on the street , and through these conversations , it &apos;s become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there &apos;s actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not saying people in the emerging markets don &apos;t understand democracy , nor am I saying that they wouldn &apos;t ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders .
Of course they would .
However , I am saying that on balance , they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from , and how it is their governments can deliver for them , than whether or not the government was elected by democracy .
The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by China .
And rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
Instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time .
explaining to you first why economically they &apos;ve come to this belief .
First of all , it &apos;s China &apos;s economic performance over the past 30 years .
She &apos;s been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
It &apos;s not just in economics , but it &apos;s also in terms of living standards .
We see that in China , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
Today , it &apos;s closer to 82 percent .
So in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
Second , China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct .
Today , the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world .
They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems , one with private capitalism , another one broadly with state capitalism .
However , these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient , which is a measure of income equality .
Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China &apos;s income equality has been improving in recent times , whereas that of the United States has been declining .
Thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at China &apos;s amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country -- she &apos;s been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States -- but even if you look to places like Africa , China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo , which is 9,000 miles , or three times the distance of New York to California .
Now this is something that people can see and point to .
Perhaps it &apos;s no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey , when surveyed , Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
Finally , China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces .
If you travel to Mogadishu , Mexico City or Mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
However , through a network of state-owned enterprises , the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas , using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions .
Ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s no surprise that around the world , people are pointing at what China is doing and saying , &quot; I like that . I want that .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
That is the system that seems to work . &quot;
I &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance .
In particular , there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth .
In fact , countries like Taiwan , Singapore , Chile , not just China , have shown that actually , it &apos;s economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy .
In a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year , your democracy will last about eight and a half years .
If your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year , then you &apos;re likely to only get 33 years of democracy .
And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water .
What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable .
But perhaps it &apos;s also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy , because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies , democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace .
The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world &apos;s countries today are democratic , 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don &apos;t have free speech or freedom of movement .
But also , we &apos;re finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years .
What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we &apos;ve got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen .
What might that world look like ?
Well , the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism ; greater protectionisms of nation-states ; but also , as I just pointed out a moment ago , ever-declining political rights and individual rights .
The question that is left for us in general is , what then should the West be doing ?
And I suggest that they have two options .
The West can either compete or cooperate .
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model , and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy , this is basically going against headwinds , but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy , and state capitalism .
Now the fact of the matter is , if the West decides to compete , it will create a wider schism .
The other option is for the West to cooperate , and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility what political and economic system works best for them .
Now I &apos;m sure some of you in the room will be thinking , well , this is like ceding to China , and this is a way , in other words , for the West to take a back seat .
But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential , they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want .
instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China , the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior , the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world , perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today .
Indeed , the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States .
Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
In fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
At its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
It &apos;s the model that put food on the table .
It &apos;s the refrigerators .
It put a man on the moon .
But the fact of the matter is , although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say , &quot; I want that , I like that , &quot; there &apos;s now a new person in town in the form of a country , China .
Today , generations are looking at China and saying , &quot; China can produce infrastructure , China can produce economic growth , and we like that . &quot;
Because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way , to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time .
As you leave here today , I would like to leave you with a very personal message , which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals , and this is really about being open-minded , open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world , creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people , has to be based in being open-minded , because these systems have good things and they have bad things .
Just to illustrate , I went into my annals of myself .
That &apos;s a picture of me .
Awww .
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969 .
At the time of my birth , blacks were not issued birth certificates , and that law only changed in 1973 .
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government .
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , I &apos;ve gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views .
In this vein , we can increase economic growth .
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
But also , it &apos;s going to require that we look at our assumptions , assumptions and strictures that we &apos;ve grown up with around democracy , around private capitalism , around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms .
We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth .
Ultimately , it &apos;s about transforming the world and making it a better place .
Thank you very much .
So anyway , who am I ?
I usually say to people , when they say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
I say , &quot; I do hardware , &quot; because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do .
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event , to which he replied , &quot; How quaint . &quot;
And I sort of really was dumbstruck .
And I really should have said something smart .
And now I &apos;ve had a little bit of time to think about it , I would have said , &quot; Well , you know , if we look at the next 100 years and we &apos;ve seen all these problems in the last few days , most of the big issues -- clean water , clean energy -- and they &apos;re interchangeable in some respects -- and cleaner , more functional materials -- they all look to me to be hardware problems .
This doesn &apos;t mean we should ignore software , or information , or computation . &quot;
And that &apos;s in fact probably what I &apos;m going to try and tell you about .
So , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
Now , TED sends you a lot of spam if you &apos;re a speaker about &quot; do this , do that &quot; and you fill out all these forms , and you don &apos;t actually know how they &apos;re going to describe you , and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist .
And I &apos;ve always been nervous about the term &quot; futurist , &quot; because you seem doomed to failure because you can &apos;t really predict it .
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have , and said , &quot; You know , well , if I have to talk about the future , what is it ? &quot;
And George Homsey , a great guy , said , &quot; Oh , the future is amazing .
It is so much stranger than you think .
We &apos;re going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut , and we &apos;re going to make your poo smell like peppermint . &quot;
So , you may think that &apos;s sort of really crazy , but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible .
So , this isn &apos;t my work , but it &apos;s work of good friends of mine at MIT .
This is called the registry of standard biological parts .
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very , very bright individuals .
Basically , what they &apos;re doing is looking at biology as a programmable system .
Literally , think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program .
Now , this is actually becoming such an interesting idea .
This is a state diagram . That &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
This one is a two-bit counter .
So that &apos;s essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches .
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology .
And from the results of the same competition last year , a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off .
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do &quot; if-then-for &quot; statements in materials , in structure .
This is a pretty interesting trend , because we used to live in a world where everyone &apos;s said glibly , &quot; Form follows function , &quot; but I think I &apos;ve sort of grown up in a world -- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday ; I was in a lab associated with his -- where it &apos;s really a world where information defines form and function .
I spent six years thinking about that , but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons I write . These are called &quot; HowToons . &quot;
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta .
Took me six years at MIT , and about that many pages to describe what I was doing , and it took him one page . And so this is our muse Tucker .
He &apos;s an interesting little kid -- and his sister , Celine -- and what he &apos;s doing here is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl .
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things , so he starts chocolate-dipping edges , changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity .
In theory , if you program those sufficiently , you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure .
In this case , he &apos;s done self-replication of a complex 3D structure .
And that &apos;s what I thought about for a long time , because this is how we currently make things .
This is a silicon wafer , and essentially that &apos;s just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff , sort of layered up .
The feature side is -- you know , people will say , &#91; unclear &#93; down around about 65 nanometers now .
On the right , that &apos;s a radiolara .
That &apos;s a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans .
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers , and it &apos;s a complex 3D structure .
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way .
The secret to biology is , it builds computation into the way it makes things . So this little thing here , polymerase , is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA .
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .
I thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems , like higher speed semiconductors , etc .
So , this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system .
And this is sort of Babbage &apos;s revenge .
These are little mechanical computers .
These are five-state state machines .
So , that &apos;s about three light switches lined up .
In a neutral state , they won &apos;t bind at all .
Now , if I make a string of these , a bit string , they will be able to replicate .
So we start with white , blue , blue , white .
That encodes ; that will now copy . From one comes two , and then from two comes three .
And so you &apos;ve got this sort of replicating system .
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose , father of Roger Penrose , the tiles guy .
He did a lot of this work in the &apos; 60s , and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it &apos;s now coming back .
So now I &apos;m going to show you the hands-free , autonomous self-replication .
So we &apos;ve tracked in the video the input string , which was green , green , yellow , yellow , green .
We set them off on this air hockey table .
You know , high science uses air hockey tables -- -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy , but what you &apos;re actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here .
So we &apos;ve got autonomous replication of bit strings .
So , why would you want to replicate bit strings ?
Well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure .
So I was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version : Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing ?
So what I &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape -- the B -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here , and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design , was that you don &apos;t need digital logic to do computation .
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips .
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process .
So , Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday , I believe , but I &apos;ll show you again .
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles .
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity , and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out .
Now , hopefully , those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that , and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure , and in fact , you know , I can now take a dog , carve it up and then reassemble it so it &apos;s a linear string that will fold from a sequence . And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits .
So , you know , it &apos;s a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently .
And the universe is now a compiler .
And so I &apos;m thinking about , you know , what are the programs for programming the physical universe ?
And how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ?
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
Having totally absorbed this philosophy , I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently .
With the universe as a computer , you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations .
You set a couple of boundary conditions , like gravity , the surface tension , density , etc . , and then you press &quot; execute , &quot; and magically , the universe produces you a perfect ball lens .
So , this actually applied to the problem of -- so there &apos;s a half a billion to a billion people in the world don &apos;t have access to cheap eyeglasses .
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ?
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .
If it &apos;s circular , you make a spherical lens .
If it &apos;s elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens .
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that &apos;s part of the extra program .
And literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error , from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder .
And then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
You know , I &apos;ll do a Julia Childs here .
This is three minutes of UV light .
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you &apos;ve cooked it . Pop it out .
I &apos;ve seen this video , but I still don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to end right .
So you reverse this . This is a very old movie , so with the new prototypes , actually both surfaces are flexible , but this will show you the point .
Now you &apos;ve finished the lens , you literally pop it out .
That &apos;s next year &apos;s Yves Klein , you know , eyeglasses shape .
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters .
And as I rotate it against this side shot , you &apos;ll see that that has cylinder , and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system .
So , this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things , like this .
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment , called &quot; electronic rope . &quot;
So literally , you think about a rope . It has very complex structure in the weave .
And under no load , it &apos;s one structure .
Under a different load , it &apos;s a different structure . And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor .
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope .
Just by thinking about the physics of the world , materials as the computer , you can start to do things like this .
I &apos;m going to segue a little here .
I guess I &apos;m just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this .
One thing I &apos;m really interested about this right now is , how , if you &apos;re really taking this view of the universe as a computer , how do we make things in a very general sense , and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ?
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems , share the information and work on those things together .
So , a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time , and unless Lisa Randall changes that , we &apos;ll continue to move in linear time .
So that means anything you do , or anything you make , you produce a sequence of steps -- and I think Lego in the &apos; 70s nailed this , and they did it most elegantly .
But they can show you how to build things in sequence .
So , I &apos;m thinking about , how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things , so you end up with this sort of guy , right ?
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
You know , Cameron Sinclair yesterday said , &quot; How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity ? &quot;
And if you &apos;ve seen Amy Smith , she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti .
And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things , so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other &apos;s source code for structure .
I don &apos;t know exactly how to do this yet , but , you know , it &apos;s something being actively thought about .
So , you know , that leads to questions like , is this a compiler ? Is this a sub-routine ?
Interesting things like that .
Maybe I &apos;m getting a little too abstract , but you know , this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe , or a different universe view , that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly . It was great to hear Bill Joy .
They &apos;re starting to invest in materials science , but these are the new things in materials science .
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? And it &apos;s not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it &apos;s sort of an analog computer .
But it &apos;s definitely an interesting new worldview .
I &apos;ve gone too far . So that sounds like it &apos;s it .
I &apos;ve probably got a couple of minutes of questions , or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction , so I may have to explain that .
So maybe I &apos;ll do that with this short video .
So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite , which also happens to be a minimal energy surface .
So returning to the droplet , again , thinking about the universe in a new way .
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp .
And why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite ?
So that &apos;s a kite the size of your house .
And so you want that to tow boats very fast .
So I &apos;ve been working on this a little , also , with a couple of other guys .
But , you know , this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again , this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe .
You could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape .
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . So that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
When we think of games , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
Maybe you &apos;re ticked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . You &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
All these things happen to me .
But when we think about games , a lot of times we think about stuff like this : first-person shooters , or the big , what we would call AAA games , or maybe you &apos;re a Facebook game player .
This is one my partner and I worked on .
Maybe you play Facebook games , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re making right now . This is a lighter form of game .
Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations .
This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out .
Or maybe you &apos;re in your living room , you know , playing with the Wii with the kids , or something like that , and , you know , there &apos;s this whole range of games , and that &apos;s very much what I think about .
I make my living from games . I &apos;ve been lucky enough to do this since I was 15 , which also qualifies as I &apos;ve never really had a real job .
But we think about games as fun , and that &apos;s completely reasonable , but let &apos;s just think about this .
So this one here , this is the 1980 Olympics .
Now I don &apos;t know where you guys were , but I was in my living room . It was practically a religious event .
And this is when the Americans beat the Russians , and this was -- yes , it was technically a game .
Hockey is a game . But really , was this a game ?
I mean , people cried . I &apos;ve never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly .
And so this was just an amazing experience .
Or , you know , if anybody here is from Boston -- So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after , I believe , 351 years , when they won the World Series , it was amazing .
I happened to be living in Springfield at the time , and the best part of it was -- is that -- you would close the women &apos;s door in the bathroom , and I remember seeing &quot; Go Sox , &quot; and I thought , really ?
Or the houses , you &apos;d come out , because every game , well , I think almost every game , went into overtime , right ?
So we &apos;d be outside , and all the other lights are on in school , and kids weren &apos;t going to school .
But it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s the Red Sox , right ?
I mean , there &apos;s education , and then there &apos;s the Red Sox , and we know where they &apos;re stacked .
So this was an amazing experience , and again , yes , it was a game , but they didn &apos;t write newspaper articles , people didn &apos;t say -- you know , really , &quot; I can die now because the Red Sox won . &quot; And many people did .
So games , it means something more to us .
It absolutely means something more .
So now , just , this is an abrupt transition here .
There was three years where I actually did have a real job , sort of .
I was the head of a college department teaching games , so , again , it was sort of a real job , and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them .
And I was at a dinner . Part of the job of it , when you &apos;re a chair of a department , is to eat , and I did that very well , and so I &apos;m out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson .
So this is Zig in this photograph . This is also one of Zig &apos;s photographs . He &apos;s a photographer .
And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he &apos;s got Zig &apos;s Indian Reservation . And this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional shots . This is a rain dancer .
And this is one of my favorite shots here .
So you can look at this , and maybe you &apos;ve even seen things like this . This is an expression of culture , right ?
And this is actually from his Degradation series .
And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just , look at that little boy there .
Can you imagine ? Now let &apos;s , we can see that &apos;s a traditional Native American . Now I just want to change that guy &apos;s race .
Just imagine if that &apos;s a black guy .
So , &quot; Honey , come here , let &apos;s get your picture with the black guy . &quot;
Right ? Like , seriously , nobody would do this .
It baffles the mind . And so Zig , being Indian , likewise it baffles his mind . His favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his , which I don &apos;t have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians .
So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer , and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred , and it was on an Indian reservation . He &apos;d taken his camera up there to photograph it , but when he got there , he discovered he couldn &apos;t do it . He just couldn &apos;t capture the picture . And so they were talking back and forth about this question . Do you take the picture or not ?
And that was fascinating to me as a game designer , because it never occurs to me , like , should I make the game about this difficult topic or not ?
Because we just make things that are fun or , you know , will make you feel fear , you know , that visceral excitement .
But every other medium does it .
So this is my kid . This is Maezza , and when she was seven years old , she came home from school one day , and like I do every single day , I asked her , &quot; What &apos;d you do today ? &quot;
So she said , &quot; We talked about the Middle Passage . &quot;
Now , this was a big moment . Maezza &apos;s dad is black , and I knew this day was coming . I wasn &apos;t expecting it at seven . I don &apos;t know why , but I wasn &apos;t .
Anyways , so I asked her , &quot; How do you feel about that ? &quot;
So she proceeded to tell me , and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here .
So the ships start in England , they come down from England , they go to Africa , they go across the ocean -- that &apos;s the Middle Passage part ‚Äî they come to America where the slaves are sold , she &apos;s telling me .
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president , and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation , and now they &apos;re free .
Pause for about 10 seconds .
&quot; Can I play a game , Mommy ? &quot;
And I thought , that &apos;s it ? And so , you know , this is the Middle Passage , this is an incredibly significant event , and she &apos;s treating it like , basically some black people went on a cruise , is more or less how it sounds to her .
And so , to me , I wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
I &apos;m a game designer , so I have this stuff sitting around my house .
So I said , &quot; Yeah , you can play a game , &quot; and I give her a bunch of these , and I tell her to paint them in different families . These are pictures of Maezza when she was ‚Äî God , it still chokes me up seeing these .
So she &apos;s painting her little families .
So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat .
This was the boat . It was made quickly obviously .
And so the basic gist of it is , I grabbed a bunch of families , and she &apos;s like , &quot; Mommy , but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things . &quot;
And she says , &quot; They want to go . &quot; And I said , &quot; Honey , no they don &apos;t want to go . This is the Middle Passage .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother , and as we &apos;re going across the ocean , following these rules , she realizes that she &apos;s rolling pretty high , and she says to me , &quot; We &apos;re not going to make it . &quot;
And she realizes , you know , we don &apos;t have enough food , and so she asks what to do , and I say , &quot; Well , we can either &quot; -- Remember , she &apos;s seven -- &quot; We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don &apos;t get sick and we make it to the other side . &quot;
And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month , right ?
After a month she says to me , &quot; Did this really happen ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; And so she said , &quot; So , if I came out of the woods &quot; ‚Äî this is her brother and sister ‚Äî &quot; If I came out of the woods , Avalon and Donovan might be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; But I &apos;d get to see them in America . &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; But what if I saw them ? You know , couldn &apos;t we stay together ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; So Daddy could be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
And she was fascinated by this , and she started to cry , and I started to cry , and her father started to cry , and now we &apos;re all crying . He didn &apos;t expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage , but there it goes .
And so , we made this game , and she got it .
She got it because she spent time with these people .
It wasn &apos;t abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie .
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
This is the game , which I &apos;ve ended up calling The New World , because I like the phrase .
I don &apos;t think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .
But when this happened , I saw the whole planet .
I was so excited . It was like , I &apos;d been making games for 20-some years , and then I decided to do it again .
My history is Irish .
So this is a game called S√≠och√°n Leat . It &apos;s &quot; peace be with you . &quot;
It &apos;s the entire history of my family in a single game .
I made another game called Train .
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics , and if you &apos;re going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and I &apos;ll let you figure out what that &apos;s about on your own .
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears .
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
I was crazy when I decided to start it , but I &apos;m in the middle of it now .
It &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
And the one I &apos;m working on right now , which is -- because I &apos;m right in the middle of it , and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers .
And originally it was a math problem more or less .
Like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal immigration .
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican ‚Äî the more I learned that , you know , for all of us , food is a basic need , but , and it is obviously with Mexicans too , but it &apos;s much more than that .
It &apos;s an expression of love . It &apos;s an expression of ‚Äî God , I &apos;m totally choking up way more than I thought .
I &apos;ll look away from the picture .
It &apos;s an expression of beauty . It &apos;s how they say they love you .
It &apos;s how they say they care , and you can &apos;t hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying &quot; food &quot; in the first sentence .
And so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games .
And so games , for a change , it changes how we see topics , it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics , and it changes ourselves .
We change as people through games , because we &apos;re involved , and we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re learning as we do so . Thank you .
I &apos;ll start with my favorite muse , Emily Dickinson , who said that wonder is not knowledge , neither is it ignorance .
It &apos;s something which is suspended between what we believe we can be , and a tradition we may have forgotten .
And I think , when I listen to these incredible people here , I &apos;ve been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas , so many visions .
And yet , when I look at the environment outside , you see how resistant architecture is to change .
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
We can think them out . We can create incredible things .
And yet , at the end , it &apos;s so hard to change a wall .
We applaud the well-mannered box .
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me ; to create something that has never been , a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits .
And I think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil .
It &apos;s based on wonder .
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities , the greatest spaces that we have had .
And I think that is indeed what architecture is . It is a story .
By the way , it is a story that is told through its hard materials .
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities .
If you think of the great buildings , of the cathedrals , of the temples , of the pyramids , of pagodas , of cities in India and beyond , you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea , but by people .
So , anything that has been made can be unmade .
Anything that has been made can be made better .
There it is : the things that I really believe are of important architecture .
These are the dimensions that I like to work with .
It &apos;s something very personal .
It &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings , to live in cities , to connect ourselves in a social space .
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
It &apos;s the only profession where you have to believe in the future .
You can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better .
And it is that belief that I think drives society .
And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us .
And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas , ideas that are not small . Think of the great cities .
Think of the Empire State Building , the Rockefeller Center .
They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way .
And yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy .
So again , I am a believer in the expressive .
I have never been a fan of the neutral .
I don &apos;t like neutrality in life , in anything .
I think expression .
And it &apos;s like espresso coffee , you know , you take the essence of the coffee .
That &apos;s what expression is .
It &apos;s been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .
And yet , I believe it is the expression -- expression of the city , expression of our own space -- that gives meaning to architecture .
And , of course , expressive spaces are not mute .
Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know .
Expressive spaces may disturb us .
And I think that &apos;s also part of life .
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile , but to reach out across the abyss of history , to places we have never been , and would have perhaps been , had we not been so lucky .
So again , radical versus conservative .
Radical , what does it mean ? It &apos;s something which is rooted , and something which is rooted deep in a tradition .
And I think that is what architecture is , it &apos;s radical .
It &apos;s not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms .
It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing .
It &apos;s not something that has a good ending or a bad ending .
It &apos;s actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way .
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture .
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
It &apos;s like the old Las Vegas used to be .
It &apos;s about conserving emotions , conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them .
And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses .
Therefore I believe it should not be cool .
There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture .
I &apos;ve always been an opponent of it . I think emotion is needed .
Life without emotion would really not be life .
Even the mind is emotional .
There is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere , in the philosophical mystery of what we are .
So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space , into city life .
And of course , we are all about the struggle of emotions .
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place .
And of course , the confrontation of the cool , the unemotional with emotion , is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered .
I think that is the progress of cities .
It &apos;s not only the forms of cities , but the fact that they incarnate emotions , not just of those who build them , but of those who live there as well .
Inexplicable versus understood . You know , too often we want to understand everything .
But architecture is not the language of words .
It &apos;s a language . But it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write .
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story , but the story is very short , which says , &quot; We have no story to tell you . &quot;
So the important thing actually , is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions , which might be totally inexplicable in words , because they operate in proportions , in materials , in light .
They connect themselves into various sources , into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn &apos;t really frontal but is really embedded in the lives , and in the history of a city , and of a people .
So again , the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion , which has reduced architecture into banality .
Hand versus the computer .
Of course , what would we be without computers ?
Our whole practice depends on computing .
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand ; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power .
Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive , in all its physiological obscurity , has a source , though the source is unknown , though we don &apos;t have to be mystical about it .
We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy .
And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer , but are not computer drawings -- drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known , not normal , not seen , yet the hand -- and that &apos;s what I really , to all of you who are working -- how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer .
I think that &apos;s part of what the complexity of architecture is .
Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good . But I don &apos;t believe it .
Listening to all of you , the complexity of thought , the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming .
And I think we shouldn &apos;t shy away in architecture , You know , brain surgery , atomic theory , genetics , economics are complex complex fields .
There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple .
It is complex . Space is complex .
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds .
And as wondrous as it is , it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired .
And yet , our lives are complex .
Our emotions are complex .
Our intellectual desires are complex .
So I do believe that architecture as I see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have , in every intimacy that we possess .
Of course that means that architecture is political .
The political is not an enemy of architecture .
The politeama is the city . It &apos;s all of us together .
And I &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more .
So again , the evasion of that sphere , which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture , the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me .
And I do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to grapple with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique .
Because architecture is also the asking of questions .
It &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
It &apos;s also , just like life , the asking of questions .
Therefore it is important that it be real .
You know we can simulate almost anything .
But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart , the human soul .
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere .
So the reality of architecture is visceral . It &apos;s not intellectual .
It &apos;s not something that comes to us from books and theories .
It &apos;s the real that we touch -- the door , the window , the threshold , the bed -- such prosaic objects . And yet , I try , in every building , to take that virtual world , which is so enigmatic and so rich , and create something in the real world .
Create a space for an office , a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real .
Unexpected versus habitual .
What is a habit ? It &apos;s just a shackle for ourselves .
It &apos;s a self-induced poison .
So the unexpected is always unexpected .
You know , it &apos;s true , the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
You know Frank Gehry &apos;s buildings , they will continue to be unexpected in the future .
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
And of course habits are enforced by architecture .
When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles , of those lights , of those materials .
We think the world really looks like our buildings .
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them .
So again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
And I often think of the raw and the refined .
What is raw ? The raw , I would say is the naked experience , untouched by luxury , untouched by expensive materials , untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture .
So the rawness , I think , in space , the fact that sustainability can actually , in the future translate into a raw space , a space that isn &apos;t decorated , a space that is not mannered in any source , but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature , might be refractive to our desires .
A space that doesn &apos;t always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us , but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities , other experiences , that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture .
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy .
And so I do like something which is pointed , not blunt , something which is focused on reality , something that has the power , through its leverage , to transform even a very small space .
So architecture maybe is not so big , like science , but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about .
And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done , what has been done , how the world has remained both in between stability and instability .
And of course buildings have their shapes .
Those shapes are difficult to change .
And yet , I do believe that in every social space , in every public space , there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought , that blunt technique , but something that pinpoints , and can point in various directions forward , backward , sideways and around .
So that is indeed what is memory .
So I believe that my main interest is to memory .
Without memory we would be amnesiacs .
We would not know which way we were going , and why we are going where we &apos;re going .
So I &apos;ve been never interested in the forgettable reuse , rehashing of the same things over and over again , which , of course , get accolades of critics .
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way .
But I rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness .
So again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
Without the memory there would be no story to tell .
There would be nowhere to turn .
The memorable , I think , is really our world , what we think the world is .
And it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mute .
It &apos;s an art of communication .
It tells a story . The story can reach into obscure desires .
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available .
It can reach into millennia that have been buried , and return them in a just and unexpected equity .
So again , I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me .
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city .
Cities should be full of vibrations , full of sound , full of music .
And that indeed is the architectural mission that I believe is important , is to create spaces that are vibrant , that are pluralistic , that can transform the most prosaic activities , and raise them to a completely different expectation .
Create a shopping center , a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment .
And these are our dreams .
And of course risk . I think architecture should be risky .
You know it costs a lot of money and so on , but yes , it should not play it safe .
It should not play it safe , because if it plays it safe it &apos;s not moving us in a direction that we want to be .
And I think , of course , risk is what underlies the world .
World without risk would not be worth living .
So yes , I do believe that the risk we take in every building .
Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent .
Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying , as they should be , for a pioneering city .
Risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws , into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready-made thing .
And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be .
It &apos;s about space . It &apos;s not about fashion .
It &apos;s not about decoration .
It &apos;s about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated , cannot be simulated in any other sphere .
And there of course is the space that we need to breathe , is the space we need to dream .
These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us , but are important for everybody in this world .
So again , it &apos;s not about the changing fashions , changing theories .
It &apos;s about carving out a space for trees .
It &apos;s carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city .
A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density .
And I think that is really the nature of architecture .
Now I am a believer in democracy .
I don &apos;t like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .
Where people cannot speak , cannot vote , cannot do anything .
We too often admire those buildings . We think they are beautiful .
And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn &apos;t give freedom to its people , I don &apos;t admire those buildings .
So democracy , as difficult as it is , I believe in it .
And of course , at Ground Zero what else ?
It &apos;s such a complex project .
It &apos;s emotional . There is so many interests .
It &apos;s political . There is so many parties to this project .
There is so many interests . There &apos;s money . There &apos;s political power .
There are emotions of the victims .
And yet , in all its messiness , in all its difficulties , I would not have liked somebody to say , &quot; This is the tabula rasa , mister architect -- do whatever you want . &quot;
I think nothing good will come out of that .
I think architecture is about consensus .
And it is about the dirty word &quot; compromise . &quot; Compromise is not bad .
Compromise , if it &apos;s artistic , if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it &apos;s not that far away .
And yet , compromise , consensus , that is what I believe in .
And Ground Zero , despite all its difficulties , it &apos;s moving forward .
It &apos;s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . Freedom Tower , the memorial .
And that is where I end .
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others , looking at America from that point of view .
This is America . This is liberty .
This is what we dream about . Its individuality , demonstrated in the skyline . It &apos;s resilience .
And finally , it &apos;s the freedom that America represents , not just to me , as an immigrant , but to everyone in the world . Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original , incredible design that you came up with ?
Daniel Libeskind : Look . We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian , that we can determine everything that happens .
We have to rely on others , and shape the process in the best way possible .
I came from the Bronx . I was taught not to be a loser , not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight .
You have to fight for what you believe . You don &apos;t always win everything you want to win . But you can steer the process .
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful , will be inspiring , will tell other generations of the sacrifices , of the meaning of this event .
Not just for New York , but for the world .
Thank you so much , Daniel Libeskind .
I &apos;m talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
I &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
I &apos;d like to tell you the story of these three children , Pranitha , Shaheen and Anjali .
Pranitha &apos;s mother was a woman in prostitution , a prostituted person .
She got infected with HIV , and towards the end of her life , when she was in the final stages of AIDS , she could not prostitute , so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker .
By the time we got the information , we reached there , Pranitha was already raped by three men .
Shaheen &apos;s background I don &apos;t even know .
We found her in a railway track , raped by many , many men , I don &apos;t know many .
But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body .
And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body .
We still don &apos;t know who her parents are , who she is .
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally .
Anjali &apos;s father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
You &apos;re seeing here images of three years , four-year-olds , and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation .
In this country , and across the globe , hundreds and thousands of children , as young as three , as young as four , are sold into sexual slavery .
But that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
They are sold in the name of organ trade .
camel jockeying , anything , everything .
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
And I tell you stories from there .
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager .
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .
I don &apos;t remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .
Yes , there were eight men who defiled me , raped me , but that didn &apos;t go into my consciousness .
I never felt like a victim , then or now .
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today -- is this huge outrageous anger .
Two years , I was ostracized , I was stigmatized , I was isolated , because I was a victim .
And that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
We , as a society , we have PhDs in victimizing a victim .
Right from the age of 15 , when I started looking around me , I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices , but have absolutely no respite , because we don &apos;t allow them to come in .
Where does their journey begin ?
Most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
I had this I.S. officer &apos;s daughter , who is 14 years old , studying in ninth standard , who was raped chatting with one individual , and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine , who was trafficked .
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families , and children from well-to-do families , who are getting trafficked .
These people are deceived , forced .
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution .
Some pay the price for it .
They &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
They are voiceless , &#91; unclear &#93; , nameless people .
But the rest , who succumb into it , go through everyday torture .
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends , or who want to have a family with you .
These are men who buy you for an hour , for a day , and use you , throw you .
Each of the girls that I have rescued -- I have rescued more than 3,200 girls -- each of them tell me one story in common ...
one story about one man , at least , putting chili powder in her vagina , one man taking a cigarette and burning her , one man whipping her .
We are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us .
And we are silent about them .
We think it is easy money .
We think it is shortcut .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections , sexually transmitted infections , HIV , AIDS , syphilis , gonorrhea , you name it , substance abuse , drugs , everything under the sun .
And one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her .
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
She believes , &quot; Yes , this is it , this is what my destiny is about . &quot;
And this is normal , to get raped by 100 men a day .
And it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
It &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilitated .
It &apos;s in that context that I work .
It &apos;s in that context that I rescue children .
I &apos;ve rescued children as young as three years , and I &apos;ve rescued women as old as 40 years .
When I rescued them , one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin .
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected .
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive .
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain .
And for me , I was my greatest experience .
Understanding my own self , understanding my own pain , my own isolation , was my greatest teacher .
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
She works for a very big company , a workshop in Hyderabad , making furnitures .
She earns around 12,000 rupees .
She is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
Why welding and why not computers ?
We felt , one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage .
They did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world , very easily , and not feel very shy about it .
We have trained girls as carpenters , as masons , as security guards , as cab drivers .
And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field , gaining confidence , restoring dignity , and building hopes in their own lives .
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons .
What has been my challenge ?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
I &apos;ve been beaten up more than 14 times in my life .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
I &apos;ve lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue .
My biggest challenge is society .
It &apos;s you and me .
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own .
A very supportive friend of mine , a well-wisher of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 rupees for vegetables .
When her mother fell sick she said , &quot; Sunitha , you have so much of contacts .
Can you get somebody in my house to work , so that she can look after my mother ? &quot;
And there is a long pause .
And then she says , &quot; Not one of our girls . &quot;
It &apos;s very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic A-C hall .
It &apos;s very nice for discussion , discourse , making films and everything .
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
It &apos;s not nice to give them employment in our factories , our companies .
It &apos;s not nice for our children to study with their children .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
If I &apos;m here today , I &apos;m here not only as Sunitha Krishnan .
I &apos;m here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking .
They need your compassion .
They need your empathy .
They need , much more than anything else , your acceptance .
Many times when I talk to people , I keep telling them one thing : don &apos;t tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem .
Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m here for , asking for your support , demanding for your support , requesting for your support .
Can you break your culture of silence ?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story ?
Tell them this story . Convince them to tell the story to another two persons .
I &apos;m not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings , or Medha Patkars , or something like that .
I &apos;m asking you , in your limited world , can you open your minds ? Can you open your hearts ?
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Because they are also a part of us .
They are also part of this world .
I &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
They died of AIDS last year .
I &apos;m asking you to help them , accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy , not as charity , but as human beings who deserve all our support .
I &apos;m asking you this because no child , no human being , deserves what these children have gone through .
Thank you .
The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the 12th of January in 2010 .
Haiti was a game changer .
The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince , claiming the lives of some 320,000 people , rendering homeless about 1.2 million people .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
I remember standing on the roof of the Ministry of Justice in downtown Port-au-Prince .
It was about two meters high , completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake .
For those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that Haiti was something different .
Haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper-connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices .
Because out of the urban devastation in Port-au-Prince came a torrent of SMS texts -- people crying for help , beseeching us for assistance , sharing data , offering support , looking for their loved ones .
This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered .
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet , but 80 percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands .
And we were unprepared for this , and they were shaping the aid effort .
Outside Haiti also , things were looking different .
Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers were scouring the Internet , converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open-source maps , layering them with all sorts of important information -- people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map -- and putting these on the Web for everybody -- the media , the aid organizations and the communities themselves -- to participate in and to use .
Back in Haiti , people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS .
People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress , were signaling their need for help .
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince , entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations .
They understood more than we did people &apos;s innate need to be connected .
Never having been confronted with this type of situation before , we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource , how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology .
We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voil√† , which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International .
We had basically three requirements .
We wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
We didn &apos;t want to shout ; we needed to listen as well .
We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities .
We didn &apos;t need to talk to the whole country at the same time .
And we wanted it to be easy to use .
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
It has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather-related disasters .
It &apos;s used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
And it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
But does it work ?
We have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
Some 74 percent of people received the data .
Those who were intended to receive the data , 74 percent of them received it .
96 percent of them found it useful .
83 percent of them took action -- evidence that it is indeed empowering .
And 73 percent of them shared it .
The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region .
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
Technology is transformational .
Right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command .
One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera .
Kibera is one of Africa &apos;s largest slums .
It &apos;s on the outskirts of Nairobi , the capital city of Kenya .
It &apos;s home to an unknown number of people -- some say between 250,000 and 1.2 million .
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map , Kibera is represented as a lush , green national park devoid of human settlement .
Young people living in Kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
They have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible .
People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information , real-time information , Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use .
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
You can find out about the latest security incident .
You can find out about places of worship .
You can find out about the health centers .
You can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
They also have their own news network on YouTube with 36,000 viewers at the moment .
They &apos;re showing us what can be done with mobile , digital technologies .
They &apos;re showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible .
And they are giving a voice to themselves .
They are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
And we &apos;re seeing from all points on the globe similar stories .
In Mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation .
And if people are migrating into urban , unfamiliar , concrete environments , they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge .
In Nigeria , open-source SMS tools are being used by the Red Cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria .
My colleague , Jason Peat , who runs this program , tells me it &apos;s 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
And not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices .
We are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile subscriptions .
By 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones in the world .
The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the Developing World , compared to 20 percent today .
We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart , fast mobile devices .
People are understanding , from Cairo to Oakland , that there are new ways to come together , there are new ways to mobilize , there are new ways to influence .
A transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models .
The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing .
We need to , for example , embrace the big data , the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data .
One idea that I &apos;d like you to consider , for instance , is to take a look at our IT departments .
They &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
We need people in our organizations who know what it &apos;s like to work with big data .
We need technology as a core organizational principle .
We need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question , &quot; What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data ? &quot;
and convert it to humanitarian good .
The possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations , not only ensure that people &apos;s right to information is met , or that they have their right to communicate , but I think in the future , humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard , that they &apos;re truly participating , that they &apos;re truly empowered in the humanitarian world .
It has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort .
We now have the tools . We now have the possibilities .
There are no more reasons not to do it .
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital .
Thank you very much .
Humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors , where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye : microorganisms .
Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems .
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans , and with the human-built environment .
And today , architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments , like this building here -- environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering , heating and air conditioning .
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors , it &apos;s important to understand how this affects our health .
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air .
And we looked at three different types of rooms .
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated , which are the data points in the blue .
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study .
And we also sampled the outdoor air .
If you look at the x-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .
So if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
But if you look at the blue data points , which is mechanically ventilated air , it &apos;s not as diverse .
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
If you look at the y-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you &apos;re outdoors .
So to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram , which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .
The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart .
And the first things that you can see from this graph is , if you look at the blue data points , which are the mechanically ventilated air , they &apos;re not simply a subset of the green data points , which are the outdoor air .
What we &apos;ve found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans .
It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit .
And this is because we &apos;re all constantly shedding microbes .
So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .
And when you &apos;re outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
Why does this matter ?
It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States .
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .
And the model that we &apos;re working with in hospitals , and also with many , many different buildings , is to keep the outdoors out .
And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health .
And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections , or hospital-acquired infections , this is a clue that it &apos;s a good time to reconsider our current practices .
So just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we &apos;re working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
I &apos;ve heard somebody say that you &apos;re as healthy as your gut .
And for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
Thank you .
The great texts of the ancient world don &apos;t survive to us in their original form .
They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them .
And so it is with Archimedes , the great Greek mathematician .
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books , and they &apos;re called A , B and C.
And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564 .
And B was last heard of in the Pope &apos;s Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311 .
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906 , and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the 19th of January , 1999 .
And this is Codex C here .
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book .
It &apos;s buried treasure .
Because this book is actually a prayer book .
It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the 14th of April , 1229 .
And to make his prayer book he used parchment .
But he didn &apos;t use new parchment , he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts , and there were seven of them .
And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven .
He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
He erased all of their texts , and then he cut the sheets down in the middle , he shuffled them up , and he rotated them 90 degrees , and he wrote prayers on top of these books .
And essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for 700 years , and we have a prayer book .
The prayer book was discovered by this guy , Johan Ludvig Heiberg , in 1906 .
And with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts .
They weren &apos;t in A and B at all ; they were completely new texts by Archimedes , and they were called &quot; The Method &quot; and &quot; The Stomachion . &quot;
And it became a world famous manuscript .
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it .
Forgeries were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mold .
This book is the definition of a write-off .
It &apos;s the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution .
But it &apos;s not in an institution , it was bought by a private owner in 1998 .
Why did he buy this book ?
Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe .
He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous .
He wanted to make that which was expensive free .
And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle .
Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes , and he promised to pay for all the work .
And it was an expensive job , but actually it wouldn &apos;t be as much as you think because these people , they didn &apos;t come from money , they came from Archimedes .
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds .
They came from particle physics , they came from classical philology , they came from book conservation , they came from ancient mathematics , they came from data management , they came from scientific imaging and program management .
And they got together to work on this manuscript .
The first problem was a conservation problem .
And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : There was glue on the spine of the book .
And if you look at this photograph carefully , the bottom half of this is rather brown .
And that glue is hide glue .
Now if you &apos;re a conservator , you can take off this glue reasonably easily .
The top half is Elmer &apos;s wood glue .
It &apos;s polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn &apos;t dissolve in water once it &apos;s dry .
And it &apos;s much tougher than the parchment that it was written on .
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes , we had to take this book apart .
So it took four years to take apart .
And this is a rare action shot , ladies and gentlemen .
Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax , because this was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church and they &apos;d used candle wax .
And the candle wax was dirty , and we couldn &apos;t image through the wax .
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
It &apos;s hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is , but it came out in little bits very often .
And normally in a book , you wouldn &apos;t worry about the little bits , but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text .
So , tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place .
Then , having done that , we started to image the manuscript .
And we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light .
Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light , you see different things .
And here is an image of a page imaged in 14 different wavebands of light .
But none of them worked .
So what we did was we processed the images together , and we put two images into one blank screen .
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript .
And the image on the left is the normal red image .
And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image .
And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing .
If you merge them together into one digital canvas , the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright .
The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark .
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another .
And it &apos;ll come out dark but red , and then you can start to read it rather clearly .
And that &apos;s what it looks like .
Now that &apos;s a before and after image , but you don &apos;t read the image on the screen like that .
You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in , and you can just read it now .
If you process the same two images in a different way , you can actually get rid of the prayer book text .
And this is terribly important , because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.
And there we are , I can give them to you .
With this kind of imaging -- this kind of infrared , ultraviolet , invisible light imaging -- we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries .
How were we going to do that ?
Well we took the manuscript , and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging .
So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom .
And that electron disappears .
And as it disappears , an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place .
And when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
It sheds an X-ray .
And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits .
And what we wanted to get was the iron .
Because the ink was written in iron .
And if we can map where this X-ray that comes out , where it comes from , we can map all the iron on the page , then theoretically we can read the image .
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this .
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California , which is a particle accelerator .
Electrons go around one way , positrons go around the other .
They meet in the middle , and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton .
Now we weren &apos;t actually going to put Archimedes in that beam .
But as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed X-rays .
And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
This is called synchrotron radiation , and it &apos;s normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing .
But we wanted it to look at atoms , at iron atoms , so that we could read the page from before and after .
And lo and behold , we found that we could do it .
It took about 17 minutes to do a single page .
So what did we discover ?
Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called &quot; The Stomachion . &quot;
And this didn &apos;t exist in Codices A and B.
And we knew that it involved this square .
And this is a perfect square , and it &apos;s divided into 14 bits .
But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits .
And now we think we know .
He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits and still make a perfect square .
Anyone want to guess the answer ?
It &apos;s 17,152 divided into 536 families .
And the important point about this is that it &apos;s the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics .
And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics .
The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made , the scribe had made his book out of , and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides .
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.
He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes .
And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of Philip of Macedon .
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon .
This was a bad idea , because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great , and they lost the battle of Chaeronea .
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world ; Hyperides found himself on trial for treason .
And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial -- and it &apos;s a great speech : &quot; Best of all , &quot; he says , &quot; is to win .
But if you can &apos;t win , then you should fight for a noble cause , because then you &apos;ll be remembered .
Consider the Spartans .
They won enumerable victories , but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends .
The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of Thermopylae where they were butchered to a man , but fought for the freedom of Greece . &quot;
It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off .
He lived for another 10 years , then the Macedonian faction caught up with him .
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory , and no one knows what they did with his body .
So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity , speaking to us , not from the grave , because his grave doesn &apos;t exist , but from the Athenian law courts .
Now I should say at this point that normally when you &apos;re looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you don &apos;t find unique texts .
And to find two in one manuscript is really something .
To find three is completely weird .
And we found three .
Aristotle &apos;s &quot; Categories &quot; is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy .
And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it , possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry .
Now all this data that we collected , all the images , all the raw images , all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a Creative Commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose .
Why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
He did this because he understands data as well as books .
Now the thing to do with books , if you want to ensure their long-term utility , is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them .
The thing to do with data , if you want it to survive , is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible .
And that &apos;s what he did .
And institutions can learn from this .
Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web , at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y &apos;s site or the University Library of X &apos;s site , which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data .
What you want to do is to aggregate it all together .
Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn &apos;t going to be built by institutions .
It &apos;s going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
And that is the future of the Web .
And it &apos;s an attractive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example , and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy -- all the raw data , all the descriptions , all the metadata .
under a Creative Commons license .
Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts , but the data is fantastic .
And the result of this is that if you do a Google search on images right now and you type in &quot; Illuminated manuscript Koran &quot; for example , 24 of the 28 images you &apos;ll find come from my institution .
Now , let &apos;s think about this for a minute .
What &apos;s in it for the institution ?
There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution .
You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing , but let &apos;s talk about selfish things .
Because what &apos;s really in it for the institution is this : Now why do people go to the Louvre ?
They go to see the Mona Lisa .
Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa ?
Because they already know what she looks like .
And they know what she looks like because they &apos;ve seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere .
Now , there is no need for these restrictions at all .
And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
Why don &apos;t we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet .
Thank you very much indeed .
Africa is booming .
Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled , and this boom is impacting on everyone .
Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade .
That means if an African child is born today , rather than three days ago , they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan .
It &apos;s that quick .
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent : 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa .
The battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest World Bank data .
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that .
This shouldn &apos;t surprise us , because actually , everybody grows .
If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D. , there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of growth .
But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians , my ancestors , were actually part of the Industrial Revolution , and in the 19th century , growth began to accelerate , and you saw that get quicker and quicker , and it &apos;s been impacting everyone .
It doesn &apos;t matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland .
Everybody gets involved . It &apos;s just a matter of when the inevitable happens .
Among the reasons I think it &apos;s happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa .
I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s , the greatest politician in the world was African , but I &apos;m meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time , and they &apos;re doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries .
And the West is engaging with that .
which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40 .
At the same time , our debt level &apos;s gone up to 120 and we &apos;re all feeling slightly miserable as a result .
Politics gets weaker when debt is high .
When public sector debt is low , governments don &apos;t have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe .
And it &apos;s not just the public sector which is looking so good .
The private sector as well .
Again , in the West , we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain , the U.K. , and the U.S.
That &apos;s an awful lot of debt .
Africa , many African countries , are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP .
If there &apos;s any continent that can do what China has done -- China &apos;s at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart -- if anyone can do what China has done in the last 30 years , it &apos;ll be Africa in the next 30 .
So they &apos;ve got great government finances , great private sector debt .
Does anyone recognize this ? In fact , they do .
Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years .
Back in the &apos; 70s , no one touched the continent with a barge pole .
And this investment is actually Western-led .
We hear a lot about China , and they do lend a lot of money , but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe , America , Australia , Canada .
Ten percent &apos;s come from India .
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now .
It &apos;s the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia .
And they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
And this very encouraging story , I think , is partly demographic-led .
And it &apos;s not just about African demographics .
I &apos;m showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world , and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second .
Ten years ago , say you &apos;re Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory , by chance .
You might choose China , which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line , where there &apos;s 200 million young people , and every year until 2010 that &apos;s getting bigger .
Which means you &apos;re going to have new guys knocking on the door saying , &quot; Give us a job , &quot; and , &quot; I don &apos;t need a big pay rise , just please give me a job . &quot;
Now , that &apos;s completely changed now .
This decade , we &apos;re going to see a 20- to 30-percent fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China .
So where do you set up your new factory ?
You look at South Asia , and people are .
They &apos;re looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh , and they &apos;re also looking at Africa .
And they &apos;re looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050 .
Now , there &apos;s a problem with lots of young people coming into any market , particularly when they &apos;re young men .
A bit dangerous , sometimes .
I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic ?
If you look at the red line here , what you &apos;re going to see is that in 1975 , just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-Saharan Africa .
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s ?
Nobody else did .
They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories , because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent .
Today , sub-Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975 .
They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth .
So what &apos;s Africa looking like today ?
This is how I look at Africa .
It &apos;s a bit odd , because I &apos;m an economist .
Each little box is about a billion dollars , and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle .
South Africa is playing a role .
But when I &apos;m thinking about the future , I &apos;m actually most interested in Central , Western and Southern Africa .
If I look at Africa by population , East Africa stands out as so much potential .
And I &apos;m showing you something else with these maps .
I &apos;m showing you democracy versus autocracy .
Fragile democracies is the beige color .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
And what you &apos;ll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies .
Why does that matter ?
Because what people want is what politicians try , they don &apos;t always succeed , but they try and deliver .
And what you &apos;ve got is a reinforcing positive circle going on .
In Ghana in the elections , in December 2012 , the battle between the two candidates was over education .
One guy offered free secondary school education to all , not just 30 percent .
The other guy had to say , I &apos;m going to build 50 new schools .
He won by a margin .
So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
Education is helping growth and investment , and that &apos;s giving budget revenues , which is giving governments more money , which is helping growth through education .
It &apos;s a positive , virtuous circle .
But I get asked this question , and this particular question makes me quite sad : It &apos;s , &quot; But what about corruption ?
How can you invest in Africa when there &apos;s corruption ? &quot;
And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth .
When you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest priority .
And the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita GDP , basically every country with a per capita GDP of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
Three out of 10 . That &apos;s not good .
Every poor country is corrupt .
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt .
How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
You see the middle class grow .
And the way to do that is to invest , not to say I &apos;m not investing in that continent because there &apos;s too much corruption .
Now , I don &apos;t want to be an apologist for corruption .
I &apos;ve been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe -- not in Africa , actually .
But what I &apos;m saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing .
Now I &apos;m going to let you in on a little not-so-secret .
Economists aren &apos;t great at forecasting .
Because the question really is , what happens next ?
And if you go back to the year 2000 , what you &apos;ll find is The Economist had a very famous cover , &quot; The Hopeless Continent , &quot; and what they &apos;d done is they &apos;d looked at growth in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent -- and they said , what &apos;s going to happen in the next 10 years ?
They assumed two percent , and that made it a pretty hopeless story , because population growth was two and a half .
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s .
Now 2012 , The Economist has a new cover , and what does that new cover show ?
That new cover shows , well , Africa rising , because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent .
I would like to see if you can all now become economists , because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent , what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa ?
Very good . I think you &apos;re secretly saying to your head , probably five and a half percent .
You &apos;re all economists , and I think , like most economists , wrong .
No offense .
What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done , and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof , suddenly shooting through the roof .
India is one of those examples .
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
Actually , for the first 20 years , the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , India didn &apos;t really grow .
It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half .
If that &apos;s familiar , that &apos;s exactly what happened in sub-Sahara in the &apos; 80s and the &apos; 90s .
And then something happened in 1980 .
Boom ! India began to explode .
It wasn &apos;t a &quot; Hindu rate of growth , &quot; &quot; democracies can &apos;t grow . &quot; Actually India could .
And if I lay sub-Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story , it &apos;s remarkably similar .
Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-Saharan African growth is slightly better than India .
And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this , I &apos;m saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa , I &apos;m saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India , I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where you &apos;re looking backwards .
And that tells me this : that Africa is going to go from a $ 2 trillion economy today to a $ 29 trillion economy by 2050 .
Now that &apos;s bigger than Europe and America put together in today &apos;s money .
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years .
The population &apos;s going to double from one billion to two billion , so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years .
And when I present this in Africa -- Nairobi , Lagos , Accra -- I get one question .
&quot; Charlie , why are you so pessimistic ? &quot;
And you know what ?
Actually , I think they &apos;ve got a point .
Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned , yes from the positives in Asia and India , but also the negatives ?
Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made .
Surely , the technologies that we &apos;re talking about here this last week , surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster ?
And I think here we can play a role .
Because technology does let you help .
You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now .
No , not right now , just 30 seconds .
You can go and buy some of the great tunes .
My iPod &apos;s full of them .
Buy African products .
Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that &apos;s happening .
Invest .
Perhaps hire people , give them the skills that they can take back to Africa , and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West .
And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa , the 21st century is their century .
Thank you very much .
So I have a strange career .
I know it because people come up to me , like colleagues , and say , &quot; Chris , you have a strange career . &quot;
And I can see their point , because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist .
And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions , and I was only 14 years old .
No , no , I wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
But after that , I actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department , and I wasn &apos;t doing any neuroscience .
Later , I would work on evolutionary genetics , and I would work on systems biology .
But I &apos;m going to tell you about something else today .
I &apos;m going to tell you about how I learned something about life .
And I was actually a rocket scientist .
I wasn &apos;t really a rocket scientist , but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it &apos;s warm ; whereas now I &apos;m in the mid-West , and it &apos;s cold .
But it was an exciting experience .
One day a NASA manager comes into my office , sits down and says , &quot; Can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside Earth ? &quot;
And that came as a surprise to me , because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation .
Yet , I had a very good answer .
I said , &quot; I have no idea . &quot;
And he told me , &quot; Biosignatures , we need to look for a biosignature . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; It &apos;s any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate And I said , &quot; Really ?
Because isn &apos;t that easy ?
I mean , we have life .
Can &apos;t you apply a definition , like for example , a Supreme Court-like definition of life ? &quot;
And then I thought about it a little bit , and I said , &quot; Well , is it really that easy ?
Because , yes , if you see something like this , then all right , fine , I &apos;m going to call it life -- no doubt about it .
But here &apos;s something . &quot;
And he goes , &quot; Right , that &apos;s life too . I know that . &quot;
Except , if you think life is also defined by things that die , you &apos;re not in luck with this thing , because that &apos;s actually a very strange organism .
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase , and actually goes backwards and backwards until it &apos;s like a little embryo again , and then actually grows back up , and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies .
So it &apos;s actually life , but it &apos;s actually not as we thought life would be .
And then you see something like that .
And he was like , &quot; My God , what kind of a life form is that ? &quot;
Anyone know ?
It &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; Hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
Except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that .
So he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t .
And then , of course , NASA also had a big announcement , and President Clinton gave a press conference , about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite .
Except that nowadays , it &apos;s heavily disputed .
If you take the lesson of all these pictures , then you realize , well actually maybe it &apos;s not that easy .
Maybe I do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction .
So can life be defined ?
Well how would you go about it ?
Well of course , you &apos;d go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
No , of course you don &apos;t do that ; you put it somewhere in Google .
And then you might get something .
And what you might get -- and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to , you throw away .
And then you might come up with something like this .
And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts .
Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane ?
Oh , it &apos;s actually a really , really , important set of concepts .
So I &apos;m highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to , but in fact on processes only .
And if you take a look at that , this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life .
And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with .
Because the idea was that , with concepts like that , maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life .
And so if you go and ask yourself , &quot; What on Earth is artificial life ? &quot; , let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about .
And it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses .
And for those of you who aren &apos;t old enough , you have no idea how this infection was working -- namely , through these floppy disks .
But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that , if you look at the rate at which the infection worked , they show this spiky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .
And it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses , a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we &apos;re used to , at least on the viral level .
So is that life ? Not as far as I &apos;m concerned .
Why ? Because these things don &apos;t evolve by themselves .
In fact , they have hackers writing them .
But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided , &quot; Why don &apos;t we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve ? &quot;
And this was Steen Rasmussen .
And he designed this system , but it really didn &apos;t work , because his viruses were constantly destroying each other .
But there was another scientist who had been watching this , an ecologist .
And he went home and says , &quot; I know how to fix this . &quot;
And he wrote the Tierra system , and , in my book , is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems -- except for the fact that these programs didn &apos;t really grow in complexity .
So having seen this work , worked a little bit on this , this is where I came in .
And I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity , more and more complex problems constantly evolving .
And of course , since I really don &apos;t know how to write code , I had help in this .
I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me .
That &apos;s Charles Offria on the left , Titus Brown on the right .
They are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University , but I can assure you , back in the day , we were not a respectable team .
And I &apos;m really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together .
But what is this system like ?
Well I can &apos;t really go into the details , but what you see here is some of the entrails .
But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure .
There &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
And all different strains are colored in different colors .
And as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spreading .
Any time there is a program that &apos;s better at surviving in this world , due to whatever mutation it has acquired , it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction .
So I &apos;m going to show you a movie where you &apos;re going to see that kind of dynamic .
And these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves .
We write our own stuff , replicate it , and are very proud of ourselves .
And we put them in , and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation .
By the way , this is highly accelerated , so it &apos;s like a thousand generations a second .
But immediately the system goes like , &quot; What kind of dumb piece of code was this ?
This can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly . &quot;
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation , like this one , which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before , until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved .
And this process goes on and on and on .
So what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we &apos;re used to life &#91; going . &#93; But what the NASA people had asked me really was , &quot; Do these guys have a biosignature ?
Can we measure this type of life ?
Because if we can , maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Well , perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process .
In fact , it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be . &quot;
And the thing I came up with -- I have to first give you an introduction about the idea , and maybe that would be a meaning detector , rather than a life detector .
And the way we would do that -- I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys , as opposed to text that &#91; is &#93; in our books .
And I would like to do it in such a way that I don &apos;t actually have to be able to read the language , because I &apos;m sure I won &apos;t be able to .
As long as I know that there &apos;s some sort of alphabet .
So here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys .
And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts , it looks like that .
And I &apos;m telling you , this is very robust across English texts .
And if I look at French texts , it looks a little bit different , or Italian or German .
They all have their own type of frequency distribution , but it &apos;s robust .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it writes about politics or about science .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a poem or whether it &apos;s a mathematical text .
It &apos;s a robust signature , and it &apos;s very stable .
As long as our books are written in English -- because people are rewriting them and recopying them -- it &apos;s going to be there .
So that inspired me to think about , well , what if I try to use this idea in order , not to detect random texts from texts with meaning , but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life .
But first I have to ask : what are these building blocks , like the alphabet , elements that I showed you ?
Well it turns out , we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks .
We could use amino acids , we could use nucleic acids , carboxylic acids , fatty acids .
In fact , chemistry &apos;s extremely rich , and our body uses a lot of them .
So that we actually , to test this idea , first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids .
And here &apos;s the result .
Here is , in fact , what you get if you , for example , look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or , in fact , in a laboratory , where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there .
What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there &apos;s some trace elements of the other ones .
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids , but there is no life .
But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers , because there &apos;s bacteria all over the place ; or you take water anywhere on Earth , because it &apos;s teaming with life , and you make the same analysis ; the spectrum looks completely different .
Of course , there is still glycine and alanine , but in fact , there are these heavy elements , these heavy amino acids , that are being produced because these are valuable to the organism .
And some other ones that are not used in the set of 20 , they will not appear at all in any type of concentration .
So this also turns out to be extremely robust .
It doesn &apos;t matter what kind of sediment you &apos;re using to grind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
Anywhere there &apos;s life , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , as opposed to that distribution .
And it is detectable not just in amino acids .
Now you could ask : well , what about these Avidians ?
The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .
So this is the distribution that you get if , in fact , there is no life .
They have about 28 of these instructions .
And if you have a system where they &apos;re being replaced one by the other , it &apos;s like the monkeys writing on a typewriter .
Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency .
But if you now take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw , it looks like this .
So there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms , and their frequency is going to be high .
And there &apos;s actually some instructions that you only use once , if ever .
So they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random .
In this case , the frequency is lower .
And so now we can see , is that really a robust signature ?
I can tell you indeed it is , because this type of spectrum , just like what you &apos;ve seen in books , and just like what you &apos;ve seen in amino acids , it doesn &apos;t really matter how you change the environment , it &apos;s very robust ; it &apos;s going to reflect the environment .
So I &apos;m going to show you now a little experiment that we did .
And I have to explain to you , the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about .
Here , in fact , that &apos;s the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency .
And below there , I show , in fact , the mutation rate in the environment .
And I &apos;m starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that , even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world , if you drop it in , it gets mutated to death immediately .
So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate .
But then I &apos;m going to slowly turn down the heat , so to speak , and then there &apos;s this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live .
And indeed , we &apos;re going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time .
So let &apos;s see what that looks like .
So first , nothing , nothing , nothing .
Too hot , too hot .
Now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
And now what I did there is , I was being nasty , I just turned up the heat again and again .
And of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
And I &apos;m just showing this to you again because it &apos;s so nice .
You hit the viability threshold .
The distribution changes to &quot; alive ! &quot;
And then , once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self-reproduce , you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes .
And then that signature is lost .
What do we learn from that ?
Well , I think we learn a number of things from that .
One of them is , if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we &apos;re not talking about things like plants , and we &apos;re not talking about amino acids , and we &apos;re not talking about bacteria , but we think in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life , not as something that is so special to Earth , but that , in fact , could exist anywhere .
Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information , of storing information within physical substrates -- anything : bits , nucleic acids , anything that &apos;s an alphabet -- and make sure that there &apos;s some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information .
And if you can do that , then you have life .
So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone , without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear , as far as the type of life on Earth is .
And that in a sense removes us again , like all of our scientific discoveries , or many of them -- it &apos;s this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we &apos;re special because we &apos;re alive .
Well we can make life . We can make life in the computer .
Granted , it &apos;s limited , but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it .
And once we have that , then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say , if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate , then we can go out and try other worlds , figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be , figure enough about the normal chemistry , the geochemistry of the planet , so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life , and then look for large deviations from this -- this thing sticking out , which says , &quot; This chemical really shouldn &apos;t be there . &quot;
Now we don &apos;t know that there &apos;s life then , but we could say , &quot; Well at least I &apos;m going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from . &quot;
And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it .
And so that &apos;s really the only take-home message that I have for you .
Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets .
And if we remove the mystery of life , then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with that .
And thank you very much .
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today -- we think of financial and economic primarily -- the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue -- our ability to address modern conflicts as they are , to go to the source of what they &apos;re all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them .
We who are diplomats , we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states .
And I can tell you , our agenda is full .
There is trade , there is disarmament , there is cross-border relations .
But the picture is changing , coming onto the scene .
We loosely call them &quot; groups . &quot;
They may represent social , religious , political , economic , military realities .
And we struggle with how to deal with them .
The rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict , the ones we used to read about .
The red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
These are quite different , and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy .
And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries .
And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
So in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
Another acknowledgment we &apos;ve seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily .
They may have to be dealt with with military means , but they cannot be solved by military means .
They need political solutions .
And we , therefore , have a problem , because they escape traditional diplomacy .
And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
Plus , during the last decade , we &apos;ve been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous .
After 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us .
It was black or white .
And groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
And who would talk to terrorists ?
The West , as I would see it , comes out of that decade weakened , because we didn &apos;t understand the group .
So we &apos;ve spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others .
Now I &apos;m not naive .
You cannot talk to everybody all the time .
And there are times you should walk .
And sometimes military intervention is necessary .
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary .
And my country relies on its security through military alliance , that &apos;s clear .
But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .
Let us turn to Afghanistan .
10 years after that military intervention , that country is far from secure .
The situation , to be honest , is very serious .
Now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem-solver .
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , I met the commander of ISAF , the international troops .
And he told me that , &quot; This can be won militarily , minister .
We just have to persevere . &quot;
Now four COM ISAF &apos;s later , we hear a different message : &quot; This cannot be won militarily .
We need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
We can only solve this through a political solution .
And it is not us who will solve it ; Afghans have to solve it . &quot;
But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 , 2002 .
They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
Everybody seems to agree with that .
It was very controversial to say three , four , five years ago .
Now everybody agrees .
But now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know .
Because we didn &apos;t talk .
We didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
The International Committee of the Red Cross , the ICRC , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral .
And that &apos;s one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk .
My point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
And you don &apos;t have to agree when you sit down with the other side .
And you can always walk .
But if you don &apos;t talk , you can &apos;t engage the other side .
And the other side which you &apos;re going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree .
Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process , &quot; You don &apos;t make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . &quot;
It &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
Let me go one step further .
This is Tahrir Square .
There &apos;s a revolution going on .
The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter .
It will last for a long , long time .
And who knows what it will be called in the end .
That &apos;s not the point .
The point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the Arab world , a revolution bottom-up -- people &apos;s revolution .
Social groups are taking to the streets .
And we find out in the West that we know very little about what &apos;s happening .
Because we never talk to the people in these countries .
Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups , because they were terrorists .
So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution , we find out how little we know .
Right now , the discussion goes , &quot; Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood ?
Should we talk to Hamas ?
If we talk to them , we may legitimize them . &quot;
I think that is wrong .
If you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing .
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we don &apos;t accept majority rights ?
Because they may turn out to be a majority .
How can we escape &#91; having &#93; a double-standard , if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time How will we ever be interlocutors ?
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .
But talking can be done in different ways .
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level .
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
There &apos;s a big array of the ways of dealing with this .
So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come , we will further radicalization , I believe .
We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel .
And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side .
The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this .
And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily .
And the reason is what happened in South Africa : Nelson Mandela .
When Mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , &quot; It &apos;s time to take up the arms , it &apos;s time to fight , &quot; he would have been followed .
And I think the international community would have said , &quot; Fair enough .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
Now as you know , Mandela didn &apos;t do that .
In his memoirs , &quot; Long Road to Freedom , &quot; he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being , also being a human being .
So he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
Now South African friends will know that was very painful .
So what can we learn from all of this ?
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals , not between groups , not between governments -- but it is very necessary .
If we &apos;re going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts , if we &apos;re going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations .
We have to connect with these profound changes .
And what is dialogue really about ?
When I enter into dialogue , I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward .
We know from our personal experiences that it &apos;s easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
And I wouldn &apos;t say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
Sometimes you have to .
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .
The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue .
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy , not only between states , but also within states .
We are seeing some new signs .
We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .
All of a sudden , NGOs were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
And they brought their knowledge .
And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up .
This is perhaps a first element of a change .
we should draw examples from these different illustrations , not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society .
And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times , climate change .
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations , unless we are able to make civil society and people , not part of the problem , but part of the solution ?
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization .
It &apos;s crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom-up .
We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
What is it that makes people trust each other , not only between states , but also within states ?
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?
The good thing is that we are not powerless .
We have never had as many means of communication , means of being connected , means of reaching out , means of including .
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it .
Now , I hope , in the coming years , that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving , among the Afghans , inside the Palestinian population , between the peoples of Palestine and Israel .
And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world , we are not powerless .
We need to improve the necessary skills , and we need the courage to use them .
In my country , I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together , not as a government initiative , but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .
And when tension increased , they already had that dialogue , and that was a strength to deal with different issues .
Our modern Western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
How are we going to settle and build a bigger &quot; We &quot; to deal with our issues if we don &apos;t improve our skills of communication ?
and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
Thank you for your attention .
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
These are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
I &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
It &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
And it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
So , we have this ability as well .
And in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
So , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
And so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
So fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
It &apos;s a huge driver for culture and I think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
We evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
But of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada , where I live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
So the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
In winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
And in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
Well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
And in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
And during this time , there &apos;s a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
So , cut to the modern day .
We &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
And you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but I believe we should understand the costs .
Thank you .
So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers : Thomas Starzl , who performed the world &apos;s first successful liver transplant in 1967 , and Sir Roy Calne , who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.
in the following year .
I returned to Singapore and , in 1990 , performed Asia &apos;s first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure , but against all odds .
Now when I look back , the transplant was actually the easiest part .
Next , raising the money to fund the procedure .
But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country .
But 20 years on , my patient , Surinder , is Asia &apos;s longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date .
And perhaps more important , I am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son .
But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .
The truth is , there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around .
As the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
In the United States alone , 100,000 men , women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs , and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs .
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation .
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living , related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver graft , to a relative or loved one .
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors .
And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy .
How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from , for example , a submissive spouse , an in-law , a servant , a slave , an employee ?
Where and how can we draw the line ?
In my part of the world , too many people live below the poverty line .
And in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant , I received my next assignment , and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners .
I was also pregnant at the time .
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman &apos;s life .
But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison &apos;s high-security death row , as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room .
And at each time , I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners &apos; eyes follow me .
And for two years , I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 4 : 30 am on a Friday morning , driving to the prison , getting down , gloved and scrubbed , ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner , remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon .
No doubt , I was informed , the consent had been obtained .
But , in my life , the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict -- conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk .
In my team , the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience .
Some of us may have been sublimated , but really none of us remained the same .
I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos .
And in my mind , I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence .
It made me wonder if there could be a better way -- a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide .
Now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
And in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells .
In 1988 , at the University of Minnesota , I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .
I witnessed the technical difficulty .
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells .
I thought to myself , why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells ? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ .
And at that time , stem cell research had gained momentum , following the isolation of the world &apos;s first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s .
The observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology , and this inspired a shift in my mindset , from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells .
And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants .
Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells .
Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage , chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types .
But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells .
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues , I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells , adipose tissue , or fat , yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I , I think , would be very happy to get rid of anyway .
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells .
And adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood , in our bone marrow , in our fat , our skin and other organs .
And as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
And here is the limitation : adult stem cells are mature cells , and , like mature human beings , these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types , as embryonic stem cells &#91; can &#93; .
But in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States , made an astounding discovery .
They discovered that adult cells , taken from you and me , could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells , which they termed IPS cells , or induced pluripotent stem cells .
And so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells .
And in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants .
If this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
Indeed , there is a lot of hype , but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions .
Heart disease , stroke , diabetes , spinal cord injury , muscular dystrophy , retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant , personally , to you ?
In May 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
I was about to start a robotic operation , but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room , I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness .
Earlier that week , I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing -- yes , I fell .
And I started to see floaters and stars , which I casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure .
What happened to me might have been catastrophic , if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access .
And I had my vision restored , but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position .
This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients , and especially those with retinal diseases .
37 million people worldwide are blind , and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision .
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants , now in a research phase , may one day restore vision , or part vision , to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide .
Indeed , we live in both challenging as well as exciting times .
As the world population ages , scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells .
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured , our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .
And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue .
Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body , or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver .
As we speak , there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
What lies ahead ?
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly .
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure .
Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
While still in a research phase , stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology .
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings -- small , incremental steps , cells rather than organs , repair rather than replacement .
Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs .
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
As we speak , the world &apos;s first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval .
And in the U.K. , neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial .
The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers .
Each one has his story .
My story has been about my journey from organs to cells -- a journey through controversy , inspired by hope -- hope that , as we age , you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life .
Thank you .
I want to discuss with you this afternoon why you &apos;re going to fail to have a great career .
I &apos;m an economist . I do dismal .
End of the day , it &apos;s ready for dismal remarks .
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career .
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
You &apos;re going to fail , too ‚Äî ‚Äî because ‚Äî Goodness , you &apos;re all cheery about failing .
Canadian group , undoubtedly .
Those trying to have good careers are going to fail , because , really , good jobs are now disappearing .
There are great jobs and great careers , and then there are the high-workload , high-stress , bloodsucking , soul-destroying kinds of jobs , and practically nothing in between .
So the people looking for good jobs are going to fail .
I &apos;m going to talk about those looking for great jobs , great careers , and why you &apos;re going to , why you &apos;re going to fail .
First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you , &quot; If you want a great career , you have to pursue your passion , you have to pursue your dreams , you have to pursue , the greatest fascination in your life , &quot; you hear it again and again and then you decide not to do it . It doesn &apos;t matter how many times you download Steven J. &apos; s Stanford commencement address , you still look at it and decide not to do it .
I &apos;m not quite sure why you decide not to do it .
You &apos;re too lazy to do it . It &apos;s too hard .
You &apos;re afraid if you look for your passion and don &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re an idiot , so then you make excuses about why you &apos;re not going to look for your passion .
And they are excuses , ladies and gentlemen .
We &apos;re going to go through a whole long list , your creativity , and thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career .
So , for example , one of your great excuses is , &quot; Well , great careers are really and truly , for most people , just a matter of luck , so I &apos;m going to stand around , I &apos;m going to try to be lucky , and if I &apos;m lucky , I &apos;ll have a great career . If not , I &apos;ll have a good career . &quot;
But a good career is an impossibility , so that &apos;s not going to work .
Then , your other excuse is , &quot; Yes , there are special people who pursue their passions , but they are geniuses .
They are Steven J. I &apos;m not a genius .
When I was five , I thought I was a genius , but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since . &quot; Mm ?
&quot; And now I know I am completely competent . &quot;
Now , you see , if this was 1950 , being completely competent , that would have given you a great career .
But guess what ? This is almost 2012 , and saying to the world , &quot; I am totally , completely competent , &quot; is damning yourself with the faintest of praise .
And then , of course , another excuse : &quot; Well , I would do this , I would do this , but , but , well , after all , I &apos;m not weird .
Everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive . A little strange ? Mm ? Mm ? Okay ?
You know , a fine line between madness and genius .
I &apos;m not weird . I &apos;ve read Steven J. &apos; s biography .
Oh my goodness . I am not that person . I am nice .
I am normal . I &apos;m a nice , normal person , and nice , normal people don &apos;t have passion .
Ah . But I still want a great career .
I &apos;m not prepared to pursue my passion , so I know what I &apos;m going to do , because I have , I have a solution , I have a strategy .
It &apos;s the one Mommy and Daddy told me about .
Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard , I &apos;d have a good career . So , if you work hard and have a good career , if you work really , really , really hard , you &apos;ll have a great career . Doesn &apos;t that , like , mathematically make sense ? &quot;
Hmm . Not .
But you &apos;ve managed to talk yourself into that .
You know what ? Here &apos;s a little secret .
You want to work ? You want to work really , really , really hard ?
You know what ? You &apos;ll succeed . The world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard , but are you so sure that that &apos;s going to give you a great career when all the evidence is to the contrary ?
So let &apos;s assume , let &apos;s deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion .
You actually understand that you really had better do it , never mind the excuses . You &apos;re trying to find your passion , and you &apos;re so happy .
You found something you &apos;re interested in .
I have an interest ! I have an interest ! You tell me .
You say , &quot; I have an interest ! &quot; I say , &quot; That &apos;s wonderful !
And what , what are you trying to tell me ? That you ‚Äî &quot; &quot; Well , I have an interest . &quot;
I say , &quot; Do you have passion ? &quot;
&quot; I have an interest , &quot; you say .
Your interest is compared to what ?
&quot; Well , I &apos;m interested in this . &quot;
And what about the rest of humanity &apos;s activities ?
&quot; I &apos;m not interested in them . &quot;
You &apos;ve looked at them all , have you ?
&quot; No . Not exactly . &quot;
Passion is your greatest love .
Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent .
Passion , interest -- it &apos;s not the same thing .
Are you really going to go to your sweetie and say , &quot; Marry me ! You &apos;re interesting . &quot;
Won &apos;t happen . Won &apos;t happen , and you will die alone .
What you want , what you want , what you want , is passion . It is beyond interest .
You need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is .
I have a friend , proposed to his sweetie .
He was an economically rational person .
He said to his sweetie , &quot; Let us marry .
Let us merge our interests . &quot;
Yes he did .
&quot; I love you truly , &quot; he said . &quot; I love you deeply . I love you more than any other woman I &apos;ve ever encountered .
I love you more than Mary , Jane , Susie , Penelope , Ingrid , Gertrude , Gretel -- I was on a German exchange program then . &quot;
&quot; I love you more than ‚Äî &quot; All right ! She left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her .
After he got over his surprise at being , you know , turned down , he concluded he &apos;d had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person , although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed , it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part .
But the point stands . You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny , or are you afraid of the word &quot; destiny &quot; ?
Does the word &quot; destiny &quot; scare you ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , and if you don &apos;t find the highest expression of your talent , if you settle for &quot; interesting , &quot; what the hell ever that means , do you know what will happen at the end of your long life ?
Your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery , and there , beside your gravesite will be a tombstone , and inscribed on that tombstone , it will say , &quot; Here lies a distinguished engineer who invented Velcro . &quot;
But what that tombstone should have said , in an alternative lifetime , what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent , was , &quot; Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics , who formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive . &quot;
Velcro , indeed .
One was a great career .
One was a missed opportunity .
But then , there are some of you , in spite of all these excuses , you will find , you will find your passion , and you &apos;ll still fail .
You &apos;re going to fail , because , because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have invented a new excuse , any excuse to fail to take action , and this excuse I &apos;ve heard so many times .
&quot; Yes , I would pursue a great career , but I value human relationships more than accomplishment .
I want to be a great friend . I want to be a great spouse .
I want to be a great parent , and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment . &quot;
What do you want me to say ?
Now , do you really want me to say now , tell you , &quot; Really , I swear I don &apos;t kick children . &quot;
Hmm ? Look at the worldview you &apos;ve given yourself .
You &apos;re a hero no matter what , and I , by suggesting , ever so delicately , that you might want a great career , must hate children . I don &apos;t hate children . I don &apos;t kick them .
Yes , there was a little kid wandering through this building when I came here , and no , I didn &apos;t kick him .
Course , I had to tell him that the building was for adults only and to get out .
He mumbled something about his mother , and I told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway .
Last time I saw him , he was on the stairs crying .
What a wimp .
But what do you mean ? That &apos;s what you expect me to say .
You really think , you really think it &apos;s appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield ?
You know what will happen someday , you , you ideal parent , you ?
The kid will come to you someday and say , &quot; I know what I want to be .
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot;
You are so happy . It &apos;s the conversation a parent wants to hear , because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next .
Says your kid , &quot; I have decided I want to be a magician .
I want to perform magic tricks on the stage . &quot;
And what do you say ?
You say , you say , &quot; Umm ... that &apos;s risky , kid .
Might fail , kid . Don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid .
You know , I don &apos;t know , kid , you should think about that again , kid , you &apos;re so good at math , why don &apos;t you ‚Äî &quot; And the kid interrupts you , and says , &quot; But it is my dream . It is my dream to do this . &quot;
And what are you going to say ?
You know what you &apos;re going to say ?
&quot; Look kid . I had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot;
So how are you going to finish the sentence with your &quot; but &quot; ?
&quot; ... But . I had a dream too , once , kid , but I was afraid to pursue it . &quot;
Or , are you going to tell him this ?
&quot; I had a dream once , kid .
But then you were born . &quot;
Do you , do you really want to use your family , do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid and see your jailers ?
There was something you could have said to your kid when he or she said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
You could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , &quot; Go for it , kid , just like I did . &quot;
But you won &apos;t be able to say that because you didn &apos;t . So you can &apos;t .
And so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children .
Why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion ?
You know why .
In your heart of hearts , you know why , and I &apos;m being deadly serious .
You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships .
It is because you are ‚Äî You know what you are .
You &apos;re afraid to pursue your passion .
You &apos;re afraid to look ridiculous .
You &apos;re afraid to try . You &apos;re afraid you may fail .
Great friend , great spouse , great parent , great career .
Is that not a package ? Is that not who you are ?
How can you be one without the other ?
But you &apos;re afraid .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career , unless -- unless , that most evocative of all English words -- unless .
But the unless word is also attached to that other , most terrifying phrase , &quot; If only I had ... &quot; &quot; If only I had ... &quot; If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain , it will hurt a lot .
So , those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to have a great career , unless ...
Unless .
Thank you .
&apos; Theme and variations &apos; is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .
I was asked , I guess about six years ago , to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca .
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree .
And that was enormously liberating to me .
Perhaps it &apos;s not a very insightful observation , but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero , in this case that remarkable painting that &apos;s in the Uffizi , &quot; The Duke of Montefeltro , &quot; who faces his consort , Battista .
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject , I did the following series of drawings .
That &apos;s the real Piero della Francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history .
And these , I &apos;ll just show these without comment .
It &apos;s just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro , who &apos;s a great , great figure in the Renaissance , and probably the basis for Machiavelli &apos;s &quot; The Prince . &quot;
He apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile .
And this is Battista .
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history , they &apos;re facing the same direction .
Whoops ! Passed each other .
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero , this is from &quot; The Resurrection of Christ &quot; -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat .
And now , four large panels : this is upper left ; upper right ; lower left ; lower right .
Incidentally , I &apos;ve never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism .
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn &apos;t seem to be an argument there .
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife , and I saw this sign , and I said , &quot; That is a fabulous piece of design . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s so persuasive , because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage , and since most people are so suspicious of garages , and know that they &apos;re going to be ripped off , they use the word &apos; reliable . &apos; But everybody says they &apos;re reliable .
But , reliable Dutchman &quot; -- -- &quot; Fantastic ! &quot;
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word , nobody calls Dutch people &quot; Dutchmen &quot; anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman , you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike , preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland , and so on .
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of &quot; Dutchman . &quot;
Now , if you think I &apos;m exaggerating at all in this , all you have to do is substitute something else , like &quot; Indonesian . &quot;
Or even &quot; French . &quot;
Now , &quot; Swiss &quot; works , but you know it &apos;s going to cost a lot of money .
I &apos;m going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts , where I teach , and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says , &quot; Do something with this . &quot;
And so he did .
And this was the text -- &quot; In words as fashion the same rule will hold / Alike fantastic if too new or old / Be not the first by whom the new are tried / Nor yet the last to lay the old aside . &quot;
I could make nothing of that .
And I really struggled with this one .
And the first thing I did , which was sort of in the absence of another idea , was say I &apos;ll sort of write it out and make some words big , and I &apos;ll have some kind of design on the back somehow , and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something .
So I took another crack at it -- you &apos;ve got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board .
I thought that something would come out of it , like &quot; Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope &quot; because it &apos;s by Alexander Pope , but I sort of made a mess out of it , and then I thought I &apos;d repeat it in some way so it was legible .
So , it was going nowhere .
Sometimes , in the middle of a resistant problem , I write down things that I know about it .
But you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; new &quot; emerging from the &quot; old . &quot;
That &apos;s what happens .
There &apos;s a relationship between the old and the new ; the new emerges from the context of the old .
And then I did some variations of it , but it still wasn &apos;t coalescing graphically at all .
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues .
The W was clearly a W , the N was clearly an N , even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn &apos;t a lot of information in it .
Then I got the words &quot; new &quot; and &quot; old &quot; and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return .
I was really desperate at this point .
And so , I do something I &apos;m truthfully ashamed of , which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together .
It says &quot; dreams &quot; at the top .
And I was going to do a thing , I say , &quot; Well , change the copy .
Let it say something about dreams , and come to SVA and you &apos;ll sort of fulfill your dreams . &quot;
But , to my credit , I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch .
And , finally , I arrived at the following solution .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look terribly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
For one thing , it transgresses the idea of what a poster &apos;s supposed to be , which is to be understood and seen immediately , and not explained .
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- &quot; If you have to explain it , it ain &apos;t working . &quot;
And one day I woke up and I said , &quot; Well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
So here &apos;s what it says in my explanation at the bottom left .
It says , &quot; Thoughts : This poem is impossible .
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
This one generates no imagery at all . &quot;
I am now exposing myself to my audience , right ?
Which is something you never want to do professionally .
&quot; Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening .
What &apos;s the heart of this poem ?
Don &apos;t be trendy if you want to be serious .
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself ?
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old , like this . &quot;
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see , you remember that old thing I discarded ?
Well , I found a way to use it .
So , there &apos;s that little alternative over there , and I say , &quot; Not bad , &quot; -- criticizing myself -- &quot; but more didactic than visual .
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace , a kind of dance where each defines the other . &quot;
And then more self-questioning -- &quot; Am I being simple-minded ?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious , or the kind that looks profound ?
There &apos;s a significant difference .
This could be embarrassing .
Actually , I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition .
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ? &quot;
Well , I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things .
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that I am confident about what I &apos;m doing .
And as you know , you have to have a front .
I mean -- you &apos;ve got to be confident ; if you don &apos;t believe in your work , who else is going to believe in it ?
So that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
That can be a big contribution .
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ; you get the big one and if you don &apos;t like that , how about the little one ?
And that too is a relatively new idea .
And here &apos;s just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?
Now , this is a little illusion .
That poster is not folded .
It &apos;s not folded , that &apos;s a photograph Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner .
And here , a very peculiar poster because , simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer , it won &apos;t sit still in the space .
At times , it seems to be wider at the back than the front , and then it shifts .
And if you sit here long enough , it &apos;ll float off the page into the audience .
But , we don &apos;t have time .
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective , where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective , but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally .
And another piece for the art directors &apos; club is &quot; Anna Rees &quot; casting long shadows .
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts .
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it , and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn &apos;t want to be embarrassed , so I worked very hard on this .
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city &apos;s subway system so every time you got on the subway you &apos;d be passing a different poster , all of which had a different idea of what art is .
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of &quot; art is &quot; and trying to determine what art was .
But then I gave up and I said , &quot; Well , art is whatever . &quot;
And as soon as I said that , I discovered that the word &quot; hat &quot; was hidden in the word &quot; whatever , &quot; and that led me to the inevitable conclusion .
But then again , it &apos;s on my list of didactic posters .
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster , in case you don &apos;t get it .
Now this says , &quot; Note to the viewer : I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte &apos;s everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history .
I &apos;m also convinced that , in an age of computer manipulation , surrealism has become banal , a shadow of its former self .
The phrase &apos; Art is whatever &apos; expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of &apos; it ain &apos;t what you do , it &apos;s the way that you do it &apos; notion .
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word &apos; hat , &apos; hidden in the word &apos; whatever . &apos; The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined : as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing , and the shape of the thing .
Whatever . &quot;
OK .
And the one that I did not submit , which I still like , I wanted to use the same phrase .
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of , see how far you could go and still be able to read them .
And that idea stuck in my head .
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom .
And , of course those are the remains , and they &apos;re so labeled .
But what really happens is that you read it as : &quot; Art is whatever remains . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me .
I feel it &apos;s sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra , an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , Vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .
All the young people , actually , from the city .
The old fogeys don &apos;t come because they &apos;re mad at Buddha , because when he came to their city he accepted -- he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him , from whoever it is , and the local geisha , a movie-star sort of person , raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first .
So he was hanging out with the movie star , and of course they were grumbling : &quot; He &apos;s supposed to be religious and all this .
What &apos;s he doing over there at Amrapali &apos;s house with all his 500 monks , &quot; and so on . They were all grumbling , and so they boycotted him .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
But the young people all came .
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol , and they put it on the ground .
And as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium , the wonder of the universe . Everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes .
And of course , in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it , and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets .
So they don &apos;t -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky -- they don &apos;t just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding .
They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected .
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection , and how we &apos;re all totally interconnected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other . And of course in the Buddhist universe , we &apos;ve already done this already billions of times in many , many lifetimes in the past .
And I didn &apos;t give the talk always . You did , and we had to watch you , and so forth .
And we &apos;re all still trying to , I guess we &apos;re all trying to become TEDsters , if that &apos;s a modern form of enlightenment .
I guess so . Because in a way , if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it &apos;s the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that &apos;s going on everywhere in the planet .
And therefore it will become intolerable -- what compassion is , is where it will become intolerable for us , totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is , and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place , or they &apos;re being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth .
It just becomes intolerable .
With all of us knowing everything , we &apos;re kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something , to become enlightened .
And of course , we all will be deeply disappointed when we do .
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do , a little bit tired , we do suffer .
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere , but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there .
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha &apos;s point of view , misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin .
And it &apos;s inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception , a little bit , right ?
You know , someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that &apos;s OK because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
What do they want from me ? Like , who &apos;s that ?
And so you wouldn &apos;t sit that close to another person because of your notion that it &apos;s you versus the universe -- that &apos;s all Buddha discovered .
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ?
Who is it who &apos;s going to get enough attention from the world ?
Who &apos;s going to get enough out of the world ?
Who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way : through art , through meditation , through understanding , through knowledge actually , knowing that you have no such boundary , knowing your interconnectedness with other beings .
You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them .
When you do that , you &apos;re forced to feel what they feel .
Luckily , they say -- I still am not sure -- but luckily , they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature , they say , &quot; Oh who would really want to be compassionate ?
How awful ! I &apos;m so miserable on my own . My head is aching .
My bones are aching . I go from birth to death . I &apos;m never satisfied .
I never have enough , even if I &apos;m a billionaire , I don &apos;t have enough .
I need a hundred billion . &quot; So I &apos;m like that .
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people &apos;s suffering .
It would be terrible .
But apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
When you &apos;re no longer locked in yourself , and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world , that enables you to let your mind spread out , and empathize , and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing , and realizing that you are the other being , somehow by that opening , you can see the deeper nature of life . And you can , you get away from this terrible iron circle of I , me , me , mine , like the Beatles used to sing .
You know , we really learned everything in the &apos; 60s .
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it , and they &apos;ve been trying to suppress it since then .
I , me , me , mine . It &apos;s like a perfect song , that song . A perfect teaching .
But when we &apos;re relieved from that , we somehow then become interested in all the other beings .
And we feel ourselves differently . It &apos;s totally strange .
It &apos;s totally strange .
The Dalai Lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence .
It &apos;s really too boring whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
Like , even when you &apos;re having a good time , when is the good time over ?
The good time is over when you think , how good is it ?
And then it &apos;s never good enough .
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time , doing it by having a good time .
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that . I wish he &apos;d been there to hear that .
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots .
He looked a little sad , because he said , well , a hundred years ago , they went and took everything away from the haves .
You know , the big communist revolutions , Russia and China and so forth .
They took it all away by violence , saying they were going to give it to everyone , and then they were even worse .
They didn &apos;t help at all .
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today ?
And so then he looks at me .
So I said , &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re all in this yourself . You teach : it &apos;s generosity , &quot; was all I could think of . What is virtue ?
But of course , what you said , I think the key to saving the world , the key to compassion is that it is more fun .
It should be done by fun . Generosity is more fun . That &apos;s the key .
Everybody has the wrong idea . They think Buddha was so boring , and they &apos;re so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he &apos;s fairly jolly .
Even though his people are being genocided -- and believe me , he feels every blow on every old nun &apos;s head , in every Chinese prison . He feels it .
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays .
I won &apos;t even say what they do . But he feels it .
And yet he &apos;s very jolly . He &apos;s extremely jolly .
Because when you open up like that , then you can &apos;t just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others &apos; misery ?
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed .
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us . She scared us with the lava man .
She scared us with the lava man is coming , then the tsunami is coming , but then finally there were flowers and trees , and it was very beautiful .
It &apos;s really lovely .
So , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
The human being is almost out of time .
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
Now , Jim &apos;s brain is memorizing the almanac .
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is , he will , he did .
He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings .
And he would have tremendous fun doing that .
So the first person who gets happy , when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of , how happy am I , where you &apos;re always dissatisfied -- as Mick Jagger told us . You never get any satisfaction that way .
So then you decide , &quot; Well , I &apos;m sick of myself .
I &apos;m going to think of how other people can be happy .
I &apos;m going to get up in the morning and think , what can I do for even one other person , even a dog , my dog , my cat , my pet , my butterfly ? &quot;
And the first person who gets happy when you do that , you don &apos;t do anything for anybody else , but you get happier , you yourself , because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it .
And you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that Chiho showed us .
It is Nirvana .
And my time is up . And I know the TED commandments .
Thank you .
It &apos;s wonderful to be back .
I love this wonderful gathering .
And you must be wondering , &quot; What on Earth ?
Have they put up the wrong slide ? &quot;
No , no .
Look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it ?
This is TED .
This is Technology , Entertainment , Design and there &apos;s a dairy cow .
It &apos;s a quite wonderfully designed animal .
And I was thinking , how do I introduce this ?
And I thought , well , maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer , you know : &quot; Poems are made by fools like me , but only God can make a tree . &quot;
And you might say , &quot; Well , God designed the cow . &quot;
But , of course , God got a lot of help .
This is the ancestor of cattle .
This is the Oryx .
And it was designed by natural selection , the process of natural selection , over many millions of years .
And then it became domesticated thousands of years ago .
And human beings became its stewards , and , without even knowing what they were doing , they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it .
And then , more recently , they really began to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better .
Now why am I talking about cows ?
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
Religions are natural phenomena .
They &apos;re just as natural as cows .
They have evolved over millennia .
They have a biological base , just like the Oryx .
They have become domesticated , and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .
This is TED , and I want to talk about design .
Because what I &apos;ve been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion , and in the last four years I &apos;ve been working just about non-stop on this topic .
And you might say it &apos;s about the reverse engineering of religions .
Now that very idea , I think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
And that is the spell that I want to break .
I want to say , no , religions are an important natural phenomenon .
We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore .
Today &apos;s religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed .
They &apos;re immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .
And , as with the cow , there &apos;s a mixture of evolutionary design , designed by natural selection itself , and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .
You don &apos;t do book talks at TED , but I &apos;m going to have just one slide about my book , because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear .
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this .
It &apos;s the one policy proposal that I make in the book , at this time when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make .
And it &apos;s one that echoes remarks that you &apos;ve heard already today .
Here &apos;s my proposal .
I &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religions , on world religions , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home schooling .
So what I &apos;m proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , arithmetic , American history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their creeds , about their texts , their music , their symbolisms , their prohibitions , their requirements .
And this should be presented factually , straightforwardly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
And as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
That , I think , is maximal tolerance for religious freedom .
As long as you inform your children about other religions , then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed you want them to learn .
But also let them know about other religions .
Now why do I say that ?
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship .
Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy .
Misinformed consent is not worth it .
It &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count really .
Democracy depends on informed consent .
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
Now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
I &apos;m going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
They don &apos;t own them .
You can &apos;t own your children .
You have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right .
You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important , but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world , too .
The reason I &apos;ve taken this time is I &apos;ve been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this .
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it &quot; totalitarian . &quot;
It strikes me as practically libertarian .
Is it totalitarian to require reading , writing and arithmetic ?
I don &apos;t think so .
All I &apos;m saying is -- facts . Facts only .
No values , just facts about all the world &apos;s religions .
Another reviewer called it &quot; hilarious . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious .
It seems to me to be such a plausible , natural extension of the democratic principles we already have , that I &apos;m shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous .
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s defensible , but I &apos;d really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later .
But now I &apos;m going to move on .
Back to the cow .
This picture , which I pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .
That &apos;s the steward .
Cows couldn &apos;t live without human stewards -- they &apos;re domesticated .
They &apos;re a sort of ectosymbiont .
They depend on us for their survival .
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep .
I &apos;m going to talk about sheep , too .
There &apos;s a lot of serendipitous convergence here .
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds !
Think of what this got them .
They could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators , food finding , health maintenance .
The only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating .
What a deal .
&quot; How clever of sheep ! &quot; you might say .
Except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cleverness .
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they &apos;re not very smart .
It wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
They were clueless .
But it was a very clever move .
Whose clever move was it ?
It was a clever move of natural selection itself .
Francis Crick , the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson , once joked about what he called Orgel &apos;s Second Rule .
Leslie Orgel is still a molecular biologist , brilliant guy , and Orgel &apos;s Second Rule is : Evolution is cleverer than you are .
Now , that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick .
Evolution is cleverer than you are .
If you understand Orgel &apos;s Second Rule , then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax .
The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what &apos;s discovered .
But the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design .
When I was here four years ago , I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass .
And why was the ant doing it ?
Well , it &apos;s because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
It was sort of a spooky story .
And I think some people may have misunderstood .
Lancet flukes aren &apos;t smart .
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot .
They &apos;re not really bright . They don &apos;t have to be .
The lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
The design is there in nature , but it &apos;s not in anybody &apos;s head .
It doesn &apos;t have to be .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
The question -- was domestication good for sheep ?
It was great for their genetic fitness .
And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago .
Here &apos;s what he said .
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one per cent of the terrestrial vertebrae landmass .
That was just 10,000 years ago .
Yesterday , in biological terms .
What is it today ? Does anybody remember what he told us ?
98 percent .
That is what we have done on this planet .
Now , I talked to Paul afterwards .
I wanted to check to find out how he &apos;d calculated this , and get the sources and so forth .
And he gave me a paper that he had written on this .
There was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good I &apos;m going to read it to you .
&quot; Over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life : complex , improbable , wonderful and fragile .
Suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
We now wield the paintbrush . &quot;
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish .
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
And we &apos;re the ones that hold the paintbrush .
And how can we do that ?
The key to our domination of the planet is culture , and the key to culture is religion .
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth .
They would be puzzled by many things .
Anybody know what this is ?
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
Here &apos;s a big crowd .
Here &apos;s another crowd in Mecca .
Martians would be amazed by this .
They &apos;d want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
Actually , I &apos;m going to pass over this .
The ant isn &apos;t alone .
There &apos;s all sorts of wonderful cases of species .
In that case , a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse -- it makes it fearless , so it runs out in the open , where it &apos;ll be eaten by a cat .
True story .
In other words , we have these hijackers -- you &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness .
Does that ever happen to us ?
Yes , it does -- quite wonderfully .
The Arabic word &quot; Islam &quot; means &quot; submission . &quot;
It means &quot; surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah . &quot;
But I &apos;m not just talking about Islam .
I &apos;m talking also about Christianity .
This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago .
And on it it says , in Latin : The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ . &quot;
Same idea ! Well , not quite .
But in fact , Christians , too , glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God .
I &apos;ll give you a few quotes .
&quot; The heart of worship is surrender .
Surrendered people obey God &apos;s words , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
Those words are by Rick Warren .
Those are from &quot; The Purpose Driven Life . &quot;
And I want to turn now , briefly , to talk about that book , which I &apos;ve read .
You &apos;ve all got a copy .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint , because I think it &apos;s actually a brilliant book .
First of all , the goal .
And you heard just now what the goal is .
It &apos;s to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
Is it a good goal ?
In itself , I &apos;m sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
He &apos;s absolutely right .
There are lots of people out there who don &apos;t have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
I give him an A + on this .
Is the goal achieved ?
Yes .
30 million copies of this book .
Al Gore , eat your heart out .
Just exactly what Al is trying to do , Rick is doing .
This is a fantastic achievement .
And , the means -- how does he do it ?
It &apos;s a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them , quietly dropping obsolete features , putting new interpretations on other features .
This is the evolution of religion that &apos;s been going on for thousands of years , and he &apos;s just the latest brilliant practitioner of it .
I don &apos;t have to tell you this .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
Excellent insights into human psychology , wise advice on every page .
Moreover , he invites us to look under the hood .
I really appreciated that .
For instance , he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses .
The book is clear , vivid , accessible , beautifully formatted .
Just enough repetition .
That &apos;s really important .
Every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
Every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
With me , everybody -- every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
Thank you .
And now we come to my problem .
Because I &apos;m absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I &apos;ve said about this book .
But I wish it were better .
I have some problems with the book .
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book .
&quot; The truth will set you free &quot; -- that &apos;s what it says in the Bible , and it &apos;s something that I want to live by , too .
My problem is , some of the bits in it I don &apos;t think are true .
Now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main complaint .
That &apos;s worth mentioning .
Here &apos;s a passage -- it &apos;s very much what he said , anyway .
&quot; If there was no God we would all be accidents , the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe .
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth . &quot;
Now , I just do not believe that .
By the way , I find Homer Groening &apos;s film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim .
Yes , there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong .
We don &apos;t need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us .
But that is just a difference of opinion .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m really worried about .
How about this -- &quot; God designed this planet &apos;s environment just so we could live in it . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don &apos;t have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do .
I &apos;m not happy with that sentiment at all .
And then I find this -- &quot; All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s Michael Denton . He &apos;s a creationist .
And here I think , &quot; Wait a minute . &quot;
I read this again .
I read it three or four times and I think , &quot; Is he really endorsing intelligent design ?
Is he endorsing creationism here ? &quot;
And you can &apos;t tell .
So I &apos;m sort of thinking , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if I want to get upset with this yet . &quot;
But then I read on and I read this : &quot; First , Noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood God irrigated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
I wish that sentence weren &apos;t in there , because I think it is false .
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet , after we &apos;ve just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years , discourages people from scientific understanding .
Now , Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way .
Here &apos;s one : &quot; God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique .
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you . &quot;
I think that &apos;s false .
Now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
Here &apos;s another one -- &quot; For instance , your brain can store 100 trillion facts .
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second . &quot;
Well , it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that .
There might be some way of treating that as true .
&quot; Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge , hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being , an inbuilt need to connect with God . &quot;
Well , there &apos;s a sense which I agree with him , except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .
And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an Intelligent Designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection .
And I think , on the contrary , that it is very important to solving the world &apos;s problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously .
Whose truth are we going to listen to ?
Well , this from &quot; The Purpose Driven Life &quot; -- &quot; The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life , the compass I rely on for direction , the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything . &quot;
Well maybe , OK , but what &apos;s going to follow from this ?
And here &apos;s one that does concern me .
Remember I quoted him before with this line -- &quot; Surrendered people obey God &apos;s word , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
And that &apos;s a problem .
&quot; Don &apos;t ever argue with the Devil .
He &apos;s better at arguing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . &quot;
Now Rick Warren didn &apos;t invent this clever move .
It &apos;s an old move .
It &apos;s a very clever adaptation of religions .
It &apos;s a wildcard for disarming any reasonable criticism .
&quot; You don &apos;t like my interpretation ?
You &apos;ve got a reasonable objection to it ?
Don &apos;t listen , don &apos;t listen !
That &apos;s the Devil speaking . &quot;
This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have .
I &apos;ve got one more problem , then I &apos;m through .
And I &apos;d really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it .
&quot; In the Great Commission , Jesus said , &apos; Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples . Baptize them in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and teach them to do everything I &apos;ve told you . &apos; &quot; The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world .
Now here we &apos;ve seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so .
Here &apos;s one , not as beautiful as the others .
It simply shows the religions of the world .
And here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions .
Now do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , &quot; Don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just Satan talking ! &quot;
It seems to me that that &apos;s a very problematic ship to get on for the future .
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently , in front of a church -- &quot; Good without God becomes zero . &quot;
Sort of cute .
A very clever little meme .
I don &apos;t believe it and I think this idea , popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .
If you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged atheists , agnostics , who are being very good without God .
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works .
So , I wish we could drop this meme .
I wish this meme would go extinct .
Thanks very much for your attention .
I need to make a confession at the outset here .
A little over 20 years ago I did something that I regret , something that I &apos;m not particularly proud of , something that , in many ways , I wish no one would ever know , but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal .
In the late 1980s , in a moment of youthful indiscretion , I went to law school .
Now , in America law is a professional degree : you get your university degree , then you go on to law school .
And when I got to law school , I didn &apos;t do very well .
To put it mildly , I didn &apos;t do very well .
I , in fact , graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top 90 percent possible .
Thank you .
I never practiced law a day in my life ; I pretty much wasn &apos;t allowed to .
But today , against my better judgment , against the advice of my own wife , I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what &apos;s left of those legal skills .
I don &apos;t want to tell you a story .
I want to make a case .
I want to make a hard-headed , evidence-based , dare I say lawyerly case , for rethinking how we run our businesses .
So , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this .
This is called the candle problem .
Some of you might have seen this before .
It &apos;s created in 1945 by a psychologist named Karl Duncker .
Karl Duncker created this experiment that is used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science .
And here &apos;s how it works . Suppose I &apos;m the experimenter .
I bring you into a room . I give you a candle , some thumbtacks and some matches .
And I say to you , &quot; Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn &apos;t drip onto the table . &quot; Now what would you do ?
Now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall .
Doesn &apos;t work .
Somebody , some people -- and I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here -- some people have a great idea where they light the match , melt the side of the candle , try to adhere it to the wall .
It &apos;s an awesome idea . Doesn &apos;t work .
And eventually , after five or 10 minutes , most people figure out the solution , which you can see here .
The key is to overcome what &apos;s called functional fixedness .
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks .
But it can also have this other function , as a platform for the candle . The candle problem .
Now I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem , done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg , who is now at Princeton University in the U.S.
This shows the power of incentives .
Here &apos;s what he did . He gathered his participants .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to time you . How quickly you can solve this problem ? &quot;
To one group he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to time you to establish norms , averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;
To the second group he offered rewards .
He said , &quot; If you &apos;re in the top 25 percent of the fastest times , you get five dollars .
If you &apos;re the fastest of everyone we &apos;re testing here today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
Now this is several years ago . Adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
It &apos;s a nice motivator .
Question : How much faster did this group solve the problem ?
Answer : It took them , on average , three and a half minutes longer .
Three and a half minutes longer . Now this makes no sense right ?
I mean , I &apos;m an American . I believe in free markets .
That &apos;s not how it &apos;s supposed to work . Right ?
If you want people to perform better , you reward them . Right ?
Bonuses , commissions , their own reality show .
Incentivize them . That &apos;s how business works .
But that &apos;s not happening here .
You &apos;ve got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity , and it does just the opposite .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
And what &apos;s interesting about this experiment is that it &apos;s not an aberration .
This has been replicated over and over and over again , for nearly 40 years .
These contingent motivators -- if you do this , then you get that -- work in some circumstances .
But for a lot of tasks , they actually either don &apos;t work or , often , they do harm .
This is one of the most robust findings in social science , and also one of the most ignored .
I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation , particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators .
And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
If you look at the science , there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
And what &apos;s alarming here is that our business operating system -- think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses , how we motivate people , how we apply our human resources -- it &apos;s built entirely around these extrinsic motivators , around carrots and sticks .
That &apos;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks .
But for 21st century tasks , that mechanistic , reward-and-punishment approach doesn &apos;t work , often doesn &apos;t work , and often does harm .
Let me show you what I mean .
So Glucksberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . Okay ?
Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn &apos;t drip onto the table .
Same deal . You : we &apos;re timing for norms .
You : we &apos;re incentivizing .
What happened this time ?
This time , the incentivized group kicked the other group &apos;s butt .
Why ? Because when the tacks are out of the box , it &apos;s pretty easy isn &apos;t it ?
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks , where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to .
Rewards , by their very nature , narrow our focus , concentrate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cases .
And so , for tasks like this , a narrow focus , where you just see the goal right there , zoom straight ahead to it , they work really well .
But for the real candle problem , you don &apos;t want to be looking like this .
The solution is not over here . The solution is on the periphery .
You want to be looking around .
That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility .
Let me tell you why this is so important .
In western Europe , in many parts of Asia , in North America , in Australia , white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work .
That routine , rule-based , left-brain work -- certain kinds of accounting , certain kinds of financial analysis , certain kinds of computer programming -- has become fairly easy to outsource , fairly easy to automate .
Software can do it faster .
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .
So what really matters are the more right-brained creative , conceptual kinds of abilities .
Think about your own work .
Think about your own work .
Are the problems that you face , or even the problems we &apos;ve been talking about here , are those kinds of problems -- do they have a clear set of rules , and a single solution ? No .
The rules are mystifying .
The solution , if it exists at all , is surprising and not obvious .
Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem .
And for candle problems of any kind , in any field , those if-then rewards , the things around which we &apos;ve built so many of our businesses , don &apos;t work .
Now , I mean it makes me crazy .
And this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
This is not a feeling .
Okay ? I &apos;m a lawyer ; I don &apos;t believe in feelings .
This is not a philosophy .
I &apos;m an American ; I don &apos;t believe in philosophy .
This is a fact -- or , as we say in my hometown of Washington , D.C. , a true fact .
Let me give you an example of what I mean .
Let me marshal the evidence here , because I &apos;m not telling you a story , I &apos;m making a case .
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , some evidence : Dan Ariely , one of the great economists of our time , he and three colleagues , did a study of some MIT students .
They gave these MIT students a bunch of games , games that involved creativity , and motor skills , and concentration .
And the offered them , for performance , three levels of rewards : small reward , medium reward , large reward .
Okay ? If you do really well you get the large reward , on down .
What happened ? As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected : the higher the pay , the better the performance .
Okay ? But one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill , a larger reward led to poorer performance .
Then they said , &quot; Okay let &apos;s see if there &apos;s any cultural bias here .
Lets go to Madurai , India and test this . &quot;
Standard of living is lower .
In Madurai , a reward that is modest in North American standards , Same deal . A bunch of games , three levels of rewards .
What happens ?
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .
But this time , people offered the highest rewards , they did the worst of all .
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments , higher incentives led to worse performance .
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here ?
No . These are economists from MIT , from Carnegie Mellon , from the University of Chicago .
And do you know who sponsored this research ?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
That &apos;s the American experience .
Let &apos;s go across the pond to the London School of Economics -- LSE , London School of Economics , alma mater of 11 Nobel Laureates in economics .
Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros , and Friedrich Hayek , and Mick Jagger .
Last month , just last month , economists at LSE looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans , inside of companies .
Here &apos;s what the economists there said : &quot; We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance . &quot;
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
And what worries me , as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse , is that too many organizations are making their decisions , their policies about talent and people , based on assumptions that are outdated , unexamined , and rooted more in folklore than in science .
And if we really want to get out of this economic mess , and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
We need a whole new approach .
And the good news about all of this is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
It &apos;s an approach built much more around intrinsic motivation .
Around the desire to do things because they matter , because we like it , because they &apos;re interesting , because they are part of something important .
And to my mind , that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements : autonomy , mastery and purpose .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
Mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
Purpose : the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves .
These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
Management did not emanate from nature .
Management is like -- it &apos;s not a tree , it &apos;s a television set .
Okay ? Somebody invented it .
And it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work forever .
Management is great .
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .
But if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
Let me give you some examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction .
What this means -- you don &apos;t see a lot of it , but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on , because what it means is paying people adequately and fairly , absolutely -- getting the issue of money off the table , and then giving people lots of autonomy .
Let me give you some examples .
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
It looks like less than half .
Atlassian is an Australian software company .
And they do something incredibly cool .
A few times a year they tell their engineers , &quot; Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want , as long as it &apos;s not part of your regular job .
Work on anything you want . &quot;
So that engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code , come up with an elegant hack .
Then they present all of the stuff that they &apos;ve developed to their teammates , to the rest of the company , in this wild and wooly all-hands meeting at the end of the day .
And then , being Australians , everybody has a beer .
They call them FedEx Days .
Why ? Because you have to deliver something overnight .
It &apos;s pretty . It &apos;s not bad . It &apos;s a huge trademark violation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .
And it &apos;s worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 Percent Time -- done , famously , at Google -- where engineers can work , spend 20 percent of their time working on anything they want .
They have autonomy over their time , their task , their team , their technique .
Okay ? Radical amounts of autonomy .
And at Google , as many of you know , about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20 Percent Time : things like Gmail , Orkut , Google News .
Let me give you an even more radical example of it : something called the Results Only Work Environment , the ROWE , created by two American consultants , in place in place at about a dozen companies around North America .
In a ROWE people don &apos;t have schedules .
They show up when they want .
They don &apos;t have to be in the office at a certain time , or any time .
They just have to get their work done .
How they do it , when they do it , where they do it , is totally up to them .
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional .
What happens ?
Almost across the board , productivity goes up , worker engagement goes up , worker satisfaction goes up , turnover goes down .
Autonomy , mastery and purpose , These are the building blocks of a new way of doing things .
Now some of you might look at this and say , &quot; Hmm , that sounds nice , but it &apos;s Utopian . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Nope . I have proof . &quot;
The mid-1990s , Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta .
They had deployed all the right incentives , all the right incentives . They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles .
Well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time .
A few years later another encyclopedia got started .
Different model , right ?
Do it for fun . No one gets paid a cent , or a Euro or a Yen .
Do it because you like to do it .
Now if you had , just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an economist , anywhere , and said , &quot; Hey , I &apos;ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia .
If they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model .
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches .
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation . Right ?
This is the Thrilla &apos; in Manila .
Alright ? Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators .
Autonomy , mastery and purpose , versus carrot and sticks . And who wins ?
Intrinsic motivation , autonomy , mastery and purpose , in a knockout . Let me wrap up .
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
And here is what science knows .
One : Those 20th century rewards , those motivators we think are a natural part of business , do work , but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances .
Two : Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity .
Three : The secret to high performance isn &apos;t rewards and punishments , but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part . Here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this . The science confirms what we know in our hearts .
So , if we repair this mismatch between what science knows and what business does , if we bring our motivation , notions of motivation into the 21st century , if we get past this lazy , dangerous , ideology of carrots and sticks , we can strengthen our businesses , we can solve a lot of those candle problems , and maybe , maybe , maybe we can change the world .
I rest my case .
Whoa , dude . Check out those killer equations . Sweet .
Actually , for the next 18 minutes I &apos;m going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations .
It turns out there &apos;s a lot we can learn from coral .
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal .
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps .
These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors .
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral , we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question .
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance , or destiny , or what ?
Now , after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high , he would tell us that our question was completely stupid .
These corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and I have surfing scars to prove that .
But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him .
That he was in all these other locations as well , but experiencing them as separate individuals .
For a coral , branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world .
Unlike us , a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics .
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works .
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities , just like a coral .
It &apos;s a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around , since we only ever get to experience one possibility .
This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schr√∂dinger and his cat .
The cat likes this version better .
In this setup , Schr√∂dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that , by the laws of quantum mechanics , branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not .
In the branch in which the sample radiates , it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr√∂dinger is dead .
But in the other branch of reality , he remains alive .
These realities are experienced separately by each individual .
As far as either can tell , the other one doesn &apos;t exist .
This seems weird to us , because each of us only experiences an individual existence , and we don &apos;t get to see other branches .
It &apos;s as if each of us , like Schr√∂dinger here , are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities .
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales .
It can be summed up in a single sentence : Everything that can happen , does .
That &apos;s quantum mechanics .
But this does not mean everything happens .
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can &apos;t .
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles .
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .
Now I &apos;ll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles , what they are and how this balance works .
In this machine , a beam of protons and anti-protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision , producing a burst of pure energy .
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles , with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties .
This enormous machine -- the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva -- has a circumference of 17 miles and , when it &apos;s operating , draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey .
We can &apos;t predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision .
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized .
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced .
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton .
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren &apos;t produced , and remain invisible to us .
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting .
It &apos;s going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before , so we &apos;re going to get to see some new particles very soon .
But before talking about what we might see , let me describe the particles we already know of .
There &apos;s a whole zoo of subatomic particles .
Most of us are familiar with electrons .
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around .
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino , with no electric charge and a very tiny mass .
In contrast , the up-and-down quarks have very large masses , and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms .
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties , and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses .
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles .
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons .
There is also a very weak force called , rather unimaginatively , the weak force , that interacts only with left-handed matter .
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge , called color charge , and come in three different varieties : red , green and blue .
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names -- they &apos;re his fault .
Finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which interacts with matter via its mass and spin .
The most important thing to understand here is that there &apos;s a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has .
A particle that hasn &apos;t been seen yet , but we &apos;re pretty sure exists , is the Higgs particle , which gives masses to all these other particles .
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle , and we &apos;re almost certain it will .
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see .
And I &apos;m going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk .
Now , if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges , there are 226 .
That &apos;s a lot of particles to keep track of .
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .
But if we plot them out according to their charges , some beautiful patterns emerge .
The most familiar charge is electric charge .
Electrons have an electric charge , a negative one , and quarks have electric charges in thirds .
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton , it has a total electric charge of plus one .
These particles also have anti-particles , which have opposite charges .
Now , it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges : hypercharge and weak charge .
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space , the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction .
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge , which make this pattern .
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model , and it was put together back in 1967 .
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle .
The Higgs , over here on the left , has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern .
It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass .
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram , the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space .
So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space .
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions .
The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space , and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them .
Whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .
If a particle and an anti-particle collide , it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions .
At this point , anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero .
For example , this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .
In further interactions , the charges must always balance .
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino , and these three still add to zero total charge .
Nature always keeps a perfect balance .
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty .
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction , which has this nice hexagonal symmetry .
In a strong interaction , a strong force particle , such as this one , interacts with a colored quark , such as this green one , to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one .
And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies , holding the atomic nuclei together .
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story .
We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force .
When we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin-up and spin-down .
So they all split , and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space .
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions , and see that it &apos;s quite pretty .
Right now , this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles .
This is what we know for certain .
Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we &apos;ve been able to reach with experiments .
From this pattern , we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales . The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful .
But now I &apos;m going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don &apos;t know yet .
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone , and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada .
We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe .
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we &apos;ll see when experiments reach higher energies .
So there &apos;s an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges , which is not very symmetric , could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .
In order to do this , we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions .
When we introduce a new direction , we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction , and then we can rotate it in with the others .
If we guess wisely , we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions .
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973 .
When we look at this new unified pattern , we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing .
This is the way theories of unification work .
A physicist looks for larger , more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset .
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .
This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles , which should act a lot like the weak force , only weaker .
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles : the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation .
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space .
However , if we work in eight-dimensional charge space , then we can assign unique new charges to each particle .
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions , and see what the whole pattern looks like .
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called &quot; triality . &quot;
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics .
It &apos;s a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group , E8 .
This Lie group is a smooth , curved shape with 248 dimensions .
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of Einstein &apos;s general relativity , explaining gravity .
Together with quantum mechanics , the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales .
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .
As we spin it , we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one .
And with a particular rotation , we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once .
It &apos;s a very beautiful object , and as with any unification , we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern .
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be , two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles .
From their location in this pattern , we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle , but have color charge and interact with the strong force .
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern , giving us the full E8 .
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
It &apos;s considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
It &apos;s a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable .
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .
In 1623 , Galileo wrote this : &quot; Nature &apos;s grand book , which stands continually open to our gaze , is written in the language of mathematics .
Its characters are triangles , circles and other geometrical figures , without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ; without these , one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth . &quot;
I believe this to be true , and I &apos;ve tried to follow Galileo &apos;s guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles , circles and other geometrical figures .
Of course , when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff , the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth .
But it &apos;s reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure , beautiful geometry .
Joined with quantum mechanics , this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral , with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern .
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider , we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one .
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in .
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern , that will be very , very cool .
If the LHC finds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this E8 theory .
And , of course , bad for me personally .
Now how bad would that be ?
Well , pretty bad .
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game .
This theory and others like it are long shots .
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
That &apos;s what doing theoretical physics is like : there are a lot of wipeouts .
In this regard , new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .
As with any large investment , it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn &apos;t working out .
But in science , if something isn &apos;t working , you have to toss it out and try something else .
Now , the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life .
I &apos;ve tried the best I can to live a balanced life .
I try to balance my life equally between physics , love and surfing -- my own three charge directions .
This way , even if the physics I work on comes to nothing , I still know I &apos;ve lived a good life .
And I try to live in beautiful places .
For most of the past ten years I &apos;ve lived on the island of Maui , a very beautiful place .
Now it &apos;s one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment .
I &apos;m going to let you in on that secret .
This was a view from my home office on Maui .
And this is another , and another .
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar , but in slightly different places .
That &apos;s because this used to be my home and office on Maui .
I &apos;ve chosen a very unusual life .
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love .
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times , but it &apos;s allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I &apos;ve been happy with .
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper-intelligent coral .
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people .
So I &apos;m very happy to have been invited here to TED .
Thank you very much .
I probably understood two percent of that , but I still absolutely loved it . So I &apos;m going to sound dumb .
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi : I &apos;m used to coral .
That &apos;s right . The reason it &apos;s got a few people at least excited is because , if you &apos;re right , it brings gravity and quantum theory together .
So are you saying that we should think of the universe , at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are , are somehow an E8 object of possibility ?
I mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ?
GL : Well , right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape .
And that &apos;s the one that I said we knew for certain .
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .
And these patterns of points that I &apos;ve shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience .
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see .
But a string theorist , as I understand it , explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you don &apos;t like string theory -- vibrating inside it .
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8 ?
GL : No , it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape .
So what &apos;s happening is , as the shape is moving over space-time , it &apos;s twisting . And the direction it &apos;s twisting as it moves is what particle we see . So it would be -- The size of the E8 shape , how does that relate to the electron ?
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture .
Is it bigger ? Is it smaller ?
GL : Well , as far as we know electrons are point particles , so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales .
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is , all possibilities are expanding and developing at once .
And this is why I use the analogy to coral .
And in this way , the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that &apos;s attached at each point in space-time .
And , as I said , the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are , themselves .
So through quantum field theory , they manifest themselves as points and interact that way .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll be able to make this any clearer .
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
It &apos;s evoking a kind of sense of wonder , and I certainly want to understand more of this .
But thank you so much for coming . That was absolutely fascinating .
My subject today is learning .
And in that spirit , I want to spring on you all a pop quiz .
Ready ?
When does learning begin ?
Now as you ponder that question , maybe you &apos;re thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
Or maybe you &apos;ve called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork .
Maybe you &apos;ve encountered the Zero-to-Three movement , which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones .
And so your answer to my question would be : Learning begins at birth .
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible , but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the womb .
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called &quot; Origins . &quot;
&quot; Origins &quot; is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins .
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago , and it &apos;s based on the theory that our health and well-being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb .
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book .
And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we &apos;re all learning about the world even before we enter it .
When we hold our babies for the first time , we might imagine that they &apos;re clean slates , unmarked by life , when in fact , they &apos;ve already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in .
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they &apos;re still in their mothers &apos; bellies .
First of all , they learn the sound of their mothers &apos; voices .
Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother &apos;s abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus , the voices fetuses hear , starting around the fourth month of gestation , are muted and muffled .
One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown &apos;s teacher in the old &quot; Peanuts &quot; cartoon .
But the pregnant woman &apos;s own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
And because the fetus is with her all the time , it hears her voice a lot .
Once the baby &apos;s born , it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else &apos;s .
How can we know this ?
Newborn babies can &apos;t do much , but one thing they &apos;re really good at is sucking .
Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples , so that if a baby sucks on one , it hears a recording of its mother &apos;s voice on a pair of headphones , and if it sucks on the other nipple , it hears a recording of a female stranger &apos;s voice .
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one .
Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored .
This is how researchers discovered that , after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss &apos; &quot; The Cat in the Hat &quot; while they were pregnant , their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb .
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born .
So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;ll be born into .
A study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies cry in the accent of their mother &apos;s native language .
French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note , imitating the melodic contours of those languages .
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
It may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
From the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother .
It even makes its cries sound like the mother &apos;s language , which may further endear the baby to the mother , and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language .
But it &apos;s not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
By seven months of gestation , the fetus &apos; taste buds are fully developed , and its olfactory receptors , which allow it to smell , are functioning .
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid , which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they &apos;re out in the world .
In one experiment , a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy , while another group of pregnant women drank only water .
Six months later , the women &apos;s infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice , and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot-flavored cereal , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more .
A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon , France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life , and again , when they were tested later , on their fourth day of life .
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as &quot; yuck . &quot;
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .
Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they &apos;ll be joining through one of culture &apos;s most powerful expressions , which is food .
They &apos;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture &apos;s cuisine even before birth .
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons .
But before I get to that , I want to address something that you may be wondering about .
The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus -- like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly .
But actually , the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that .
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she &apos;s exposed to , even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus .
They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself .
The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body , makes them part of its flesh and blood .
And often it does something more .
It treats these maternal contributions as information , as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside .
So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart &apos;s &quot; Magic Flute &quot; but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
Will it be safe and protected , or will it face constant dangers and threats ?
Will it live a long , fruitful life or a short , harried one ?
The pregnant woman &apos;s diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .
The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus &apos; brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility , our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments , from the country to the city , from the tundra to the desert .
To conclude , I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they &apos;re born .
In the autumn of 1944 , the darkest days of World War II , German troops blockaded Western Holland , turning away all shipments of food .
The opening of the Nazi &apos;s siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades -- so cold the water in the canals froze solid .
Soon food became scarce , with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day -- a quarter of what they consumed before the war .
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
By the beginning of May , the nation &apos;s carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted .
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
And then on May 5th , 1945 , the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies .
The &quot; Hunger Winter , &quot; as it came to be known , killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more .
But there was another population that was affected -- the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege .
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths , birth defects , low birth weights and infant mortality .
But others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
Decades after the &quot; Hunger Winter , &quot; researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity , more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions .
These individuals &apos; prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways .
They have higher blood pressure , poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes .
Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation .
When food is scarce , they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term , but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs , deprived early on , become more susceptible to disease .
But that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly .
They &apos;re preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb .
The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it .
And the basis of the fetus &apos; prediction is what its mother eats .
The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story , a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation .
This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems -- an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival .
Faced with severely limited resources , a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements will , in fact , have a better chance of living to adulthood .
The real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch &quot; Hunger Winter . &quot;
And their higher rates of obesity , diabetes and heart disease are the result .
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet .
The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born .
Here &apos;s another story .
At 8 : 46 a.m. on September 11th , 2001 , there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York -- commuters spilling off trains , waitresses setting tables for the morning rush , brokers already working the phones on Wall Street .
1,700 of these people were pregnant women .
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
About a year after 9 / 11 , researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack .
In the babies of those women who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome , or PTSD , following their ordeal , researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD -- an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester .
In other words , the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero .
Now consider this : post-traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong , causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances .
In a particularly dangerous environment , the characteristic manifestations of PTSD -- a hyper-awareness of one &apos;s surroundings , a quick-trigger response to danger -- could save someone &apos;s life .
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative , but I find it rather poignant .
It would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it &apos;s a wild world out there , telling them , &quot; Be careful . &quot;
Let me be clear .
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy .
It &apos;s about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation .
That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb .
Learning is one of life &apos;s most essential activities , and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .
Thank you .
My name is Lovegrove . I only know nine Lovegroves , two of which are my parents .
They are first cousins , and you know what happens when , you know -- so there &apos;s a terribly weird freaky side to me , which I &apos;m fighting with all the time . So to try and get through today , I &apos;ve kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk .
I was hanging on to have a pee .
I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough , that would guide me through the 18 minutes .
Okay . I am known as Captain Organic , and that &apos;s a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position .
But today what I &apos;d like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people &apos;s soul and emotion .
Not very long ago , not many thousands of years ago , we actually lived in caves , and I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve lost that coding system .
We respond so well to form , but I &apos;m interested in creating intelligent form .
I &apos;m not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design .
These -- this artificially induced consumerism -- I think it &apos;s atrocious .
My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins , Janine Benyus , James Watson .
I &apos;m in that world , but I work purely instinctively .
I &apos;m not a scientist . I could have been , perhaps , but I work in this world where I trust my instincts .
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with .
And we should be developing things -- we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people &apos;s perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use .
So , the water bottle .
I &apos;ll begin with this concept of what I call DNA .
DN Design , Nature , Art . These are the three things that condition my world .
Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci , 500 years ago , before photography .
It shows how observation , curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art .
Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
People like Leonardo -- there have not been many -- had this amazingly instinctive curiosity .
I work from a similar position .
I don &apos;t want to sound pretentious saying that , but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago -- well into the 21st century , 500 years later .
It &apos;s my impression of water .
Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it : 100 million dollars , easily , for a Monet .
I use , now , a whole new process .
A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn , Tom Main , Zaha Hadid , Rem Koolhaas -- all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form .
This is all created digitally .
Here you see the machining , the milling of a block of acrylic .
This is what I show to the client to say , &quot; That &apos;s what I want to do . &quot;
At that point , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s possible at all .
It &apos;s a seductor , but I just feel in my bones that that &apos;s possible .
So we go . We look at the tooling . We look at how that is produced .
These are the invisible things that you never see in your life .
This is the background noise of industrial design .
That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra .
It is more valuable than the product in my eyes . I don &apos;t have one .
When I do make some money , I &apos;ll have one machined for myself .
This is the final product . When they sent it to me , I thought I &apos;d failed .
It felt like nothing . It has to feel like nothing .
It was when I put the water in that I realized that I &apos;d put a skin on water itself .
It &apos;s an icon of water itself , and it elevates people &apos;s perception of contemporary design .
Each bottle is different , meaning the water level will give you a different shape .
It &apos;s mass individualism from a single product . It fits the hand .
It fits arthritic hands . It fits children &apos;s hands .
It makes the product strong , the tessellation .
It &apos;s a millefiori of ideas .
In the future they will look like that , because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things , perhaps , in life .
Biopolymers , these new ideas for materials , will come into play in probably a decade .
It doesn &apos;t look as cool , does it ?
But I can live up to that . I don &apos;t have a problem with that .
I design for that condition , biopolymers . It &apos;s the future .
I took this video in Cape Town last year .
This is the freaky side coming out .
I have this special interest in things like this which blow my mind .
I don &apos;t know whether to , you know , drop to my knees , cry ; I don &apos;t know what I think . But I just know that nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed , and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking .
When I look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
But these things evolved over many years , and now what we &apos;re trying to do -- I get three weeks to design a telephone .
How the hell do I do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
How do you condense that ?
It comes back to instinct .
I &apos;m not talking about designing telephones that look like that , and I &apos;m not looking at designing architecture like that .
I &apos;m just interested in natural growth patterns , and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates .
How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I &apos;m trying to understand .
This is a scan through the human forearm . It &apos;s then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal the cellular structure . I have these in my office .
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab .
It &apos;s a weird , kind of freaky place .
This is one of my specimens .
This is made -- bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers .
I studied cooking in school for four years , and in that experience , which was called &quot; domestic science , &quot; it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification .
Actually , I put marijuana in everything I cooked -- -- and I had access to all the best girls . It was fabulous .
All the guys in the rugby team couldn &apos;t understand , but anyway -- this is a meringue . This is another sample I have .
A meringue is made exactly the same way , in my estimation , as a bone .
It &apos;s made from polysaccharides and proteins .
If you pour water on that , it dissolves .
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future ?
Not a bad idea . I don &apos;t know . I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that , but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something , a car -- I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m also interested in growth patterns : the unbridled way that nature grows things so you &apos;re not restricted by form at all .
These interrelated forms , they do inspire everything I do although I might end up making something incredibly simple .
This is a detail of a chair that I &apos;ve designed in magnesium .
It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking , shown pretty much as a bone structure .
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
It &apos;s the world &apos;s first chair made in magnesium .
It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . It &apos;s called &quot; Go &quot; by Bernhardt , USA .
It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century .
Boy . For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village , that &apos;s enough .
It shows how you make one holistic form , like the car industry , and then you break up what you need .
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
It &apos;s a godly way of working .
It &apos;s organic and it &apos;s essential .
It &apos;s an absolutely fat-free design , and when you look at it , you see human beings . Bless you .
When that moves into polymers , you can change the elasticity , the fluidity of the form .
This is an idea for a gas-injected , one-piece polymer chair .
What nature does is it drills holes in things . It liberates form .
It takes away anything extraneous . That &apos;s what I do .
I make organic things which are essential .
I don &apos;t -- and they look funky too -- but I don &apos;t set out to make funky things because I think that &apos;s an absolute disgrace .
I set out to look at natural forms .
If you took the idea of fractal technology further , take a membrane , shrinking it down constantly like nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair ; it could be a sole for a sports shoe ; it could be a car blending into seats .
Wow . Let &apos;s go for it . That &apos;s the kind of stuff .
This is what exists in nature . Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day . That &apos;s what I do .
This is a show that &apos;s currently on in Tokyo .
It &apos;s called &quot; Superliquidity . &quot; It &apos;s my sculptural investigation .
It &apos;s like 21st-century Henry Moore . When you see a Henry Moore still , your hair stands up . There &apos;s some amazing spiritual connect .
If he was a car designer , phew , we &apos;d all be driving one .
In his day , he was the highest taxpayer in Britain .
That is the power of organic design .
It contributes immensely to our sense of being , our sense of relationships with things , our sensuality and , you know , the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side , which is very important .
This is my artwork . This is all my process .
These actually are sold as artwork .
They &apos;re very big prints . But this is how I get to that object .
Ironically , that object was made by the Killarney process , which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century , and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that .
I &apos;ll tell you about that later .
When I look into these data images , I see new things .
I &apos;m self -- it &apos;s self-inspired . Diatomic structures , radiolaria , the things that we couldn &apos;t see but we can do now -- these , again , are cored out . They &apos;re made virtually from nothing .
They &apos;re made from silica . Why not structures from cars like that ?
Coral , all these natural forces , take away what they don &apos;t need and they deliver maximum beauty .
We need to be in that realm . I want to do stuff like that .
This is a new chair which should come on the market in September .
It &apos;s for a company called Moroso in Italy .
It &apos;s a gas-injected polymer chair .
Those holes you see there are very filtered-down , watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures .
It goes with the flow of the polymer and you &apos;ll see -- there &apos;s an image coming up right now that shows the full thing .
It &apos;s great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming .
If you see the shadows that come through that , they &apos;re actually probably more important than the product , but it &apos;s the minimum it takes .
The coring out of the back lets you breathe .
It takes away any material you don &apos;t need and it actually garners flexure too , so -- I was going to break into a dance then .
This is some current work I &apos;m doing .
I &apos;m looking at single-surface structures and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . It &apos;s based on furniture typologies , but that &apos;s not the end motivation . It &apos;s made from aluminum , as opposed to aluminium , and it &apos;s grown .
It &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that I go through .
This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry , who build parts for Bentleys and so on .
It &apos;s being built as we speak , and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York .
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers .
When I see these animations , oh Jesus , I &apos;m blown away .
This is what goes on in my studio everyday . I walk -- I &apos;m traveling . I come back .
Some guy &apos;s got that on a computer -- there &apos;s this like , oh my goodness .
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
This kind of effervescent , fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas .
Single-surface products . Furniture &apos;s a good one .
How you grow legs out of a surface .
I would love to build this one day , and perhaps I &apos;d like to build it also out of flour , sugar , polymer , wood chips -- I don &apos;t know , human hair . I don &apos;t know . I &apos;d love a go at that .
I don &apos;t know . If I just got some time .
That &apos;s the weird side coming out again , and a lot of companies don &apos;t understand that .
Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo . They said , &quot; Give us the dream .
What is our dream ? How do we beat Apple ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well you don &apos;t copy Apple , that &apos;s for sure . &quot;
I said , &quot; You get into biopolymers . &quot; They looked straight through me .
What a waste . Anyway .
No , it &apos;s true . Fuck &apos; em . Fuck &apos; em . You know , I mean .
I &apos;m delivering ; they &apos;re not taking . I &apos;ve had this image 20 years .
I &apos;ve had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed .
That is an image of a car for me .
That &apos;s the car of the future . It &apos;s a water droplet .
I &apos;ve been banging on about this like I can &apos;t believe .
Cars are all wrong .
I &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this .
The only place that didn &apos;t laugh was Moscow .
Its cars are made from 30,000 components .
How ridiculous is that ? Couldn &apos;t you make that from 300 ?
It &apos;s got a vacuum-formed , carbon-nylon pan . Everything &apos;s holistically integrated .
It opens and closes like a bread bin .
There is no engine . There &apos;s a solar panel on the back , and there are batteries in the wheels .
They &apos;re fitted like Formula One . You take them off your wall .
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go .
A three-wheeled car : slow , feminine , transparent , so you can see the people in there . You drive different .
You see that thing . You do .
You do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
There &apos;s a hole at the front , and there &apos;s a reason for that .
It &apos;s a city car . You drive along . You get out .
You drive on to a proboscis . You get out . It lifts you up .
It presents the solar panel to the sun , and at night it &apos;s a street lamp .
That &apos;s what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first , and then do the car second . These bubbles -- I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages , floating around on the ground driven by AI .
When I showed this in South Africa , everybody after was going , &quot; Yeah , hey , car on a stick . Like this . &quot;
Can you imagine ? A car on a stick .
If you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
And that &apos;s what I do with my furniture .
I &apos;m not putting Charles Eames &apos; furniture in buildings anymore .
Forget that . We move on .
I &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
I &apos;m trying to build transportation systems .
I work on aircraft for Airbus , the whole thing -- I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural , inspired-by-nature dreams home . I &apos;m going to finish on two things .
This is the steriolithography of a staircase .
It &apos;s a little bit of a dedication to James , James Watson .
I built this thing for my studio .
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin . I built this .
This is the data that goes with that . Incredibly complex .
Took about two years , because I &apos;m looking for fat-free design .
Lean , efficient things . Healthy products .
This is built by composites . It &apos;s a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element , and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places .
Modern materials allow us to do modern things .
This is a shot in the studio .
This is how it looks pretty much every day .
You wouldn &apos;t want to have a fear of heights coming down it .
There is virtually no handrail . It doesn &apos;t pass any standards .
Who cares ?
Yeah , and it has an internal handrail which gives it it &apos;s strength . It &apos;s this holistic integration .
That &apos;s my studio . It &apos;s subterranean .
It &apos;s in Notting Hill next to all the crap -- you know , the prostitutes and all that stuff .
It &apos;s next to David Hockney &apos;s original studio .
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day .
My guys go out for lunch . The door &apos;s open . They come back in , because it &apos;s normally raining , and they prefer to stay in .
This is my studio . Elephant skull from Oxford University , 1988 .
I bought that last year . They &apos;re very difficult to find .
I would -- if anybody &apos;s got a whale skeleton they want to sell me , I &apos;ll put it in the studio .
So I &apos;m just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you &apos;ll see in the video .
It &apos;s a homemade video , made it myself at three o &apos;clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is . You never see that .
You never see architects or designers showing you their real world .
This is called a &quot; Plasnet . &quot;
It &apos;s a bio-polycarbonate new chair I &apos;m doing in Italy .
World &apos;s first bamboo bike with folding handlebars .
We should all be riding one of these .
As China buys all these crappy cars , we should be riding things like this . Counterbalance .
Like I say , it &apos;s a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory . It &apos;s full of prototypes and objects .
It &apos;s self-inspirational again . I mean , the rare times when I &apos;m there , I do enjoy it . And I get lots of kids coming -- lots and lots of kids coming .
I &apos;m a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers .
This -- sorry -- -- that &apos;s a solar seed . It &apos;s a concept for new architecture .
That thing on the top is the world &apos;s first solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced . Giles Revell should be talking here today -- amazing photography of things you can &apos;t see .
The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo .
Lots of stuff . There &apos;s a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called &quot; Leaf . &quot;
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
On the wall is my book called &quot; Supernatural , &quot; which allows me to remember what I &apos;ve done , because I forget .
There &apos;s an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year , in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture .
&#91; Unclear &#93; , working at three o &apos;clock in the morning -- and I don &apos;t pay overtime .
Overtime is the passion of design , so join the club or don &apos;t .
No , it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true . People like Tom and Greg -- we &apos;re traveling like you can &apos;t -- we fit it all in . I don &apos;t know how we do it .
Next week I &apos;m at Electrolux in Sweden , then I &apos;m in Beijing on Friday . You work that one out .
And when I see Ed &apos;s photographs I think , why the hell am I going to China ? It &apos;s true .
It &apos;s true . Because there &apos;s a soul in this whole thing .
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
We need to combine all this stuff .
If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together , it would be a joy , absolute joy .
So there &apos;s a new X-light system I &apos;m doing in Japan .
There &apos;s Tuareg shoes from North Africa . There &apos;s a Kifwebe mask .
These are my sculptures .
A copper jelly mold .
It sounds like some quiz show or something , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , it &apos;s going to end .
Thank you , James , for your great inspiration .
Thank you very much .
Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly -- not another fresh drop of oil -- and to do no harm to the biosphere .
Take nothing : do no harm .
I simply said , &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot;
It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years -- that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; The Corporation , &quot; what I meant by the &quot; go to jail &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true -- for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime -- there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -- in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population , affluence and technology .
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
So the equation is conceptual .
Still it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denominator decreases impact .
So I ask , &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator -- call it T1 -- where it increases impact , to the denominator -- call it T2 -- where it reduces impact ?
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
Linear : take , make , waste .
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
More carpet per man-hour .
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measured our progress very rigorously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -- so the scientists are telling us .
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that &apos;s 74,000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified .
We call it Cool Carpet .
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
It is practical , and pretty too .
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
We call this Mission Zero .
And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
Here is the business case for sustainability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste -- the first face of Mount Sustainability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
Costs , products , people , marketplaces -- what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
We literally gained market share .
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness -- more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would reframe civilization itself -- -- and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations -- that is to say , into the indefinite future .
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in execution .
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here -- frankly , an unacceptable risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot;
&quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
A wise friend introduced us two .
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
Knowing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
Begin , I will .
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot;
Well , every day of my life since , &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
So the machine I &apos;m going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was .
It was a machine that was never built , and yet , it will be built .
It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers .
If you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the &apos; 30s and the &apos; 40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you &apos;d have the wrong century .
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s , not the 1930s and 1940s .
It was designed , and parts of it were prototyped , and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington .
That machine was built by this guy , Charles Babbage .
Now , I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture .
He was a very wealthy man , and a sort of , part of the aristocracy of Britain , and on a Saturday night in Marylebone , were you part of the intelligentsia of that period , you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree ‚Äî and he invited everybody : kings , the Duke of Wellington , many , many famous people ‚Äî and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines .
I really miss that era , you know , where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you .
But Babbage , Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century , and was a fairly famous mathematician .
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge , and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking .
He &apos;s less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them .
The reason he never made any of them , he &apos;s a classic nerd .
Every time he had a good idea , he &apos;d think , &quot; That &apos;s brilliant , I &apos;m going to start building that one .
I &apos;ll spend a fortune on it . I &apos;ve got a better idea .
I &apos;m going to work on this one . And I &apos;m going to do this one . &quot;
He did this until Sir Robert Peel , then Prime Minister , basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street , and kicking him out , in those days , that meant saying , &quot; I bid you good day , sir . &quot;
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here , the analytical engine . Now , just to give you an idea of this , this is a view from above .
Every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive .
So as I go through this talk , I want you to imagine this gigantic machine . We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like .
And I &apos;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine ‚Äî that &apos;s why it &apos;s computer architecture ‚Äî and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
So let &apos;s talk about the memory . The memory is very like the memory of a computer today , except it was all made out of metal , stacks and stacks of cogs , 30 cogs high .
Imagine a thing this high of cogs , hundreds and hundreds of them , and they &apos;ve got numbers on them .
It &apos;s a decimal machine . Everything &apos;s done in decimal .
And he thought about using binary . The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall , it would have been ridiculous . As it is , it &apos;s enormous .
So he &apos;s got memory .
The memory is this bit over here .
You see it all like this .
This monstrosity over here is the CPU , the chip , if you like .
Of course , it &apos;s this big .
Completely mechanical . This whole machine is mechanical .
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum .
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition , multiplication , subtraction , division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal , but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn &apos;t : this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision .
It could do the &quot; if then &quot; for basic programmers , and that fundamentally made it into a computer .
It could compute . It couldn &apos;t just calculate . It could do more .
Now , if we look at this , and we stop for a minute , and we think about chips today , we can &apos;t look inside a silicon chip . It &apos;s just so tiny .
Yet if you did , you would see something very , very similar to this .
There &apos;s this incredible complexity in the CPU , and this incredible regularity in the memory .
If you &apos;ve ever seen an electron microscope picture , you &apos;ll see this . This all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , which is punch cards . This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the Science Museum , just not far from here , created by Charles Babbage , that is sitting there ‚Äî you can go see it ‚Äî waiting for the machine to be built .
And there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen .
Now , the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard , in France , had created the Jacquard loom , which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards , so he was just repurposing the technology of the day , and like everything else he did , he &apos;s using the technology of his era , so 1830s , 1840s , 1850s , cogs , steam , mechanical devices . Ironically , born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday , who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo , transformers , all these sorts of things .
Babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
Now , he needed accessories .
Obviously , you &apos;ve got a computer now .
You &apos;ve got punch cards , a CPU and memory .
You need accessories you &apos;re going to come with .
You &apos;re not just going to have that , So , first of all , you had sound . You had a bell , so if anything went wrong ‚Äî ‚Äî or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring .
And there &apos;s actually an instruction on the punch card which says &quot; Ring the bell . &quot; So you can imagine this &quot; Ting ! &quot;
You know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing , &quot; Click , clack click click click , &quot; steam engine , &quot; Ding , &quot; right ?
You also need a printer , obviously , and everyone needs a printer .
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the Difference Engine No. 2 , which he never built , but which the Science Museum did build in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
It &apos;s completely mechanical , again , a printer .
It prints just numbers , because he was obsessed with numbers , but it does print onto paper , and it even does word wrapping , so if you get to the end of the line , it goes around like that .
You also need graphics , right ?
I mean , if you &apos;re going to do anything with graphics , so he said , &quot; Well , I need a plotter . I &apos;ve got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I &apos;ll make it plot . &quot;
So he designed a plotter as well , and , you know , at that point , I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine .
Along comes this woman , Ada Lovelace .
Now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
This lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron &apos;s madness and badness , thought , &quot; I know the solution : Mathematics is the solution .
We &apos;ll teach her mathematics . That &apos;ll calm her down . &quot;
Because of course , there &apos;s never been a mathematician that &apos;s gone crazy , so , you know , that &apos;ll be fine .
Everything &apos;ll be fine . So she &apos;s got this mathematical training , and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother , and Charles Babbage , you know , gets out his machine .
The Duke of Wellington is there , you know , get out the machine , obviously demonstrates it , and she gets it . She &apos;s the only person in his lifetime , really , who said , &quot; I understand what this does , and I understand the future of this machine . &quot;
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her .
Now , some people call her the first programmer .
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated .
This is a program written in a particular style .
It &apos;s not , historically , totally accurate that she &apos;s the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
Rather than just being a programmer , she saw something that Babbage didn &apos;t .
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics .
He was building a machine to do mathematics , and Lovelace said , &quot; You could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; And just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
If you go into that phone , every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics . It &apos;s all numbers at the bottom .
Whether it &apos;s video or text or music or voice , it &apos;s all numbers , it &apos;s all , underlying it , mathematical functions happening , and Lovelace said , &quot; Just because you &apos;re doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn &apos;t mean these things can &apos;t represent other things in the real world , such as music . &quot;
This was a huge leap , because Babbage is there saying , &quot; We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs , &quot; ‚Äî ‚Äî and Lovelace is there and she says , &quot; Look , this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically . &quot;
So this is what I call Lovelace &apos;s Leap .
When you say she &apos;s a programmer , she did do some , but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much , much more than this .
Now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , Alan Turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again .
Now , of course , Babbage &apos;s machine was entirely mechanical .
Turing &apos;s machine was entirely theoretical .
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective , but Turing told us something very important .
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter how you make a computer . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t matter if your computer &apos;s mechanical , like Babbage &apos;s was , or electronic , like computers are today , or perhaps in the future , cells , or , again , mechanical again , once we get into nanotechnology .
We could go back to Babbage &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . All those things are computers .
There is in a sense a computing essence .
This is called the Church ‚Äì Turing thesis .
And so suddenly , you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer .
In fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly .
To give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1k of memory .
It used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81 .
It did have a RAM pack .
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to .
So , where does that bring us today ?
So there are plans .
Over in Swindon , the Science Museum archives , there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine .
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28 , and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade , who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum , and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine , and our plan is to build it .
Here in South Kensington , we will build the analytical engine .
The project has a number of parts to it .
One was the scanning of Babbage &apos;s archive .
That &apos;s been done . The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine , and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum .
When it &apos;s built , you &apos;ll finally be able to understand how a computer works , because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you &apos;ve got to look at this humongous thing and say , &quot; Ah , I see the memory operating , I see the CPU operating , I hear it operating . I probably smell it operating . &quot;
But in between that we &apos;re going to do a simulation .
Babbage himself wrote , he said , as soon as the analytical engine exists , it will surely guide the future course of science .
Of course , he never built it , because he was always fiddling with new plans , but when it did get built , of course , in the 1940s , everything changed .
Now , I &apos;ll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working .
So this is just three sets of cogs , and it &apos;s going to add . This is the adding mechanism in action , so you imagine this gigantic machine .
So , give me five years .
Before the 2030s happen , we &apos;ll have it .
Thank you very much .
Allison Hunt : My three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
Reset the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fair .
AH : Oh my God , it &apos;s harsh up here .
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
Do you know that surgery ?
Electric saw , power drill , totally disgusting unless you &apos;re David Bolinsky , in which case it &apos;s all truth and beauty .
Sure David , if it &apos;s not your hip , it &apos;s truth and beauty .
Anyway , I did have a really big epiphany around the situation , so Chris invited me to tell you about it .
But first you need to know two things about me .
Just two things .
I &apos;m Canadian , and I &apos;m the youngest of seven kids .
Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system .
That means we get our new hips for free .
And being the youngest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ?
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
I finally went to the doctor , which was free .
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free .
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year .
That is what free gets you .
I met the surgeon , and he took some free X-rays , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hip was bad , and I actually work in marketing .
So he said , &quot; Allison , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
I &apos;m going to replace your hip -- it &apos;s about an 18-month wait . &quot;
18 more months .
I &apos;d already waited 10 months , and I had to wait 18 more months .
You know , it &apos;s such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
I would still be on my bad hip . That was so disappointing .
So , I left his office and I was walking through the hospital , and that &apos;s when I had my epiphany .
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
Oh yeah .
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is ?
We do not think that way .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consideration .
In fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow Canadians .
&quot; After you . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , no . After you . &quot;
Hey , are you from Canada ? &quot; Oh , me too ! Hi ! &quot;
&quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;
So no , suddenly I wasn &apos;t averse to butting any geezer off the list .
Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing , or gardening .
No , no . Front of the line .
So by now I was walking the lobby , and of course , that hurt , because of my hip , and I kind of needed a sign .
And I saw a sign .
In the window of the hospital &apos;s tiny gift shop there was a sign that said , &quot; Volunteers Needed . &quot; Hmm .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
No reference checks . None of the usual background stuff , no .
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .
Yeah . They needed some young blood .
So , next thing you know , I had my bright blue volunteer vest , I had my photo ID , and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .
I worked alone .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
While ringing in hospital staff &apos;s Tic Tacs , I &apos;d casually ask , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
Then I &apos;d tell them , &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months .
It &apos;s gonna be so great when the pain stops . Ow ! &quot;
All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer .
My next surgeon &apos;s appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification .
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
And you know , when he walked in , I could just tell that he saw them .
Moments later , I had a surgery date just weeks away , and a big fat prescription for Percocet .
Now , word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line .
And , you know , I &apos;m not even ashamed of that .
Two reasons .
First of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hip .
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering , which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all .
Even when a Canadian cheats the system , they do it in a way that benefits society .
For me they normally happen , these career crises , often , actually , on a Sunday evening , just as the sun is starting to set , and the gap between my hopes for myself , and the reality of my life , start to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow .
I &apos;m mentioning all this , I &apos;m mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem .
You may think I &apos;m wrong in this , but I think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises , by moments when what we thought we knew , about our lives , about our careers , comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality .
It &apos;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living .
It &apos;s perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm , to be free of career anxiety .
I want to look now , if I may , at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers .
Why we might be victims of these career crises , as we &apos;re weeping softly into our pillows .
One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs .
In a way , I &apos;ve got some bad news , particularly to anybody who &apos;s come to Oxford from abroad .
There is a real problem with snobbery .
Because sometimes people from outside the U.K.
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .
We are a global organization . This is a global phenomenon .
It exists . What is a snob ?
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are .
That is snobbery .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
You encounter it within minutes at a party , when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And according to how you answer that question , people are either incredibly delighted to see you , or look at their watch and make their excuses .
Now , the opposite of a snob is your mother .
Not necessarily your mother , or indeed mine , but , as it were , the ideal mother , somebody who doesn &apos;t care about your achievements .
But unfortunately , most people are not our mothers .
Most people make a strict correlation between how much time , and if you like , love -- not romantic love , though that may be something -- but love in general , respect , they are willing to accord us , that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy .
And that &apos;s a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods .
You know , we &apos;re often told that we live in very materialistic times , that we &apos;re all greedy people .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
It &apos;s not the material goods we want . It &apos;s the rewards we want .
And that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari don &apos;t think , &quot; This is somebody who is greedy . &quot;
Think , &quot; This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love . &quot;
In other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
There are other reasons -- there are other reasons why it &apos;s perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before .
One of these , and it &apos;s paradoxical because it &apos;s linked to something that &apos;s rather nice , is the hope we all have for our careers .
Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan .
We &apos;re told , from many sources , that anyone can achieve anything .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality . We &apos;re all basically equal .
There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies .
There is one really big problem with this , and that problem is envy .
Envy , it &apos;s a real taboo to mention envy , but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society , that is envy .
And it &apos;s linked to the spirit of equality . Let me explain .
I think it would be very unusual for anyone here , or anyone watching , to be envious of the Queen of England .
Even though she is much richer than any of you are .
And she &apos;s got a very large house .
The reason why we don &apos;t envy her is because she &apos;s too weird .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
We can &apos;t relate to her . She speaks in a funny way .
She comes from an odd place .
So we can &apos;t relate to her . And when you can &apos;t relate to somebody , you don &apos;t envy them .
The closer two people are , in age , in background , in the process of identification , the more there is a danger of envy -- which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion -- because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with .
But the problem , generally , of modern society , is that it turns the whole world into a school . Everybody is wearing jeans , everybody is the same .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
So there is a spirit of equality , combined with deep inequalities .
Which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation .
It &apos;s probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates , as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy .
But the point is , it doesn &apos;t feel that way .
It &apos;s made to feel , by magazines and other media outlets , that if you &apos;ve got energy , a few bright ideas about technology , a garage , you too could start a major thing .
And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops .
When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections , as I sometimes do , if you analyze self-help books that are produced in the world today , there are basically two kinds .
The first kind tells you , &quot; You can do it ! You can make it ! Anything is possible ! &quot;
And the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call &quot; low self-esteem , &quot; or impolitely call &quot; feeling very bad about yourself . &quot;
There is a real correlationship , a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low self-esteem .
So that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious , about our careers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
And it is , again , linked to something nice , and that nice thing is called meritocracy .
Everybody , all politicians on Left and Right , agree that meritocracy is a great thing , and we should all be trying to make our societies really , really meritocratic .
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ?
A meritocratic society is one in which if you &apos;ve got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top . Nothing should hold you back .
It &apos;s a beautiful idea . The problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by implication , and in a far more nasty way , believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
In other words , your position in life comes to seem not accidental , but merited and deserved .
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
You know , in the Middle Ages , in England , when you met a very poor person , that person would be described as an &quot; unfortunate &quot; -- literally , somebody who had not been blessed by fortune , an unfortunate .
Nowadays , particularly in the United States , if you meet someone at the bottom of society , they may unkindly be described as a &quot; loser . &quot;
There is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser , and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives .
It &apos;s no longer the gods , it &apos;s us . We &apos;re in the driving seat .
That &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not .
It leads , in the worst cases , in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim , it leads to increased rates of suicide .
There are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world .
And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally .
They own their success . But they also own their failure .
Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I &apos;ve just been outlining ?
I think there is . I just want to turn to a few of them .
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy .
I will support any politician of Left and Right , with any halfway decent meritocratic idea .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
But I think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic . It &apos;s an impossible dream .
The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded , the good at the top , and the bad at the bottom , and it &apos;s exactly done as it should be , is impossible .
There are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people &apos;s heads , illnesses , etc .
We will never get to grade them , never get to grade people as they should .
I &apos;m drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in &quot; The City of God , &quot; where he says , &quot; It &apos;s a sin to judge any man by his post . &quot;
In modern English that would mean it &apos;s a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
According to St. Augustine , it &apos;s only God who can really put everybody in their place .
And he &apos;s going to do that on the Day of Judgment with angels and trumpets , and the skies will open .
Insane idea , if you &apos;re a secularist person , like me .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
In other words , hold your horses when you &apos;re coming to judge people .
You don &apos;t necessarily know what someone &apos;s true value is .
That is an unknown part of them .
And we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
When we think about failing in life , when we think about failure , one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income , a loss of status .
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others . And it exists .
You know , the number one organ of ridicule nowadays , is the newspaper .
And if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve messed up their lives .
They &apos;ve slept with the wrong person . They &apos;ve taken the wrong substance .
They &apos;ve passed the wrong piece of legislation . Whatever it is .
And then are fit for ridicule .
In other words , they have failed . And they are described as &quot; losers . &quot;
Now is there any alternative to this ?
I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative , and that is tragedy .
Tragic art , as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece , in the fifth century B.C. , was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail , and also according them a level of sympathy , which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them .
I remember a few years ago , I was thinking about all this , and I went to see &quot; The Sunday Sport , &quot; a tabloid newspaper that I don &apos;t recommend you to start reading if you &apos;re not familiar with it already .
I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art .
I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon .
So I told them about Othello . They had not heard of it but were fascinated by it .
And I asked them to write the headline for the story of Othello .
They came up with &quot; Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator &apos;s Daughter &quot; splashed across the headline .
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
Again , a book they were enchanted to discover .
And they wrote &quot; Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud . &quot;
And then my favorite .
They really do have a kind of genius all of their own , these guys .
My favorite is Sophocles &apos; Oedipus the King : &quot; Sex With Mum Was Blinding &quot; In a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
At the other end of the spectrum you &apos;ve got tragedy and tragic art , and I suppose I &apos;m arguing that we should learn a little bit about what &apos;s happening in tragic art .
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser .
He is not a loser , though he has lost .
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us , and why it &apos;s so very , very important , I think .
The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human .
We are the first society to be living in a world where we don &apos;t worship anything other than ourselves .
We think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
We &apos;ve put people on the moon . We &apos;ve done all sorts of extraordinary things .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
Most other societies have had , right at their center , the worship of something transcendent : a god , a spirit , a natural force , the universe , whatever it is , something else that is being worshiped .
We &apos;ve slightly lost the habit of doing that , which is , I think , why we &apos;re particularly drawn to nature .
Not for the sake of our health , though it &apos;s often presented that way , but because it &apos;s an escape from the human anthill .
It &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
And that &apos;s why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans , and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters , etc .
We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human , and that is so deeply important to us .
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means .
If I said to you that there is somebody behind the screen who is very very successful , certain ideas would immediately come to mind .
You would think that person might have made a lot of money , achieved renown in some field .
My own theory of success -- and I &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . I really want to be successful .
I &apos;m always thinking , &quot; How could I be more successful ? &quot;
But as I get older , I &apos;m also very nuanced about what that word &quot; success &quot; might mean .
Here &apos;s an insight that I &apos;ve had about success .
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
Nonsense . You can &apos;t have it all . You can &apos;t .
So any vision of success has to admit what it &apos;s losing out on , where the element of loss is .
I think any wise life will accept , as I say , that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding .
Thing about a successful life is , a lot of the time , our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own .
They are sucked in from other people : chiefly , if you &apos;re a man , your father , and if you &apos;re a woman , your mother .
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years .
No one is quite listening hard enough , but I very much believe that that &apos;s true .
And we also suck in messages from everything from the television , to advertising , to marketing , etc .
These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves .
When we &apos;re told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking .
When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking .
We are highly open to suggestion .
So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success , but we should make sure that they are our own .
We should focus in on our ideas and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions .
Because it &apos;s bad enough , not getting what you want , but it &apos;s even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey , that it isn &apos;t , in fact , what you wanted all along .
So I &apos;m going to end it there .
But what I really want to stress is by all means , success , yes .
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Let &apos;s probe away at our notions of success .
Let &apos;s make sure our ideas of success are truly our own .
Thank you very much .
That was fascinating . How do you reconcile this idea of someone being -- it being bad to think of someone as a loser with the idea , that a lot of people like , of seizing control of your life .
And that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers .
Alain de Botton : Yes . I think it &apos;s merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I wanted to stress .
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything , and politicians always talk about justice .
Now I am a firm believer in justice , I just think that it is impossible .
So we should do everything we can , we should do everything we can to pursue it .
But at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us , whatever has happened in their lives , there will be a strong element of the haphazard .
And it &apos;s that that I &apos;m trying to leave room for .
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic .
I mean , do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder , gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy ?
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
But it doesn &apos;t matter that much that we &apos;re putting too much emphasis on that ?
The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them , and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge .
You want to think , who would you like as your ideal dad ?
And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
We need fathers , as it were , the exemplary father figures in society , avoiding the two extremes , which is the authoritarian , disciplinarian , on the one hand , and on the other , the lax , no rules option .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk about the power of a word : jihad .
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims , jihad is an internal struggle for the faith .
It is a struggle within , a struggle against vice , sin , temptation , lust , greed .
It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran .
In that original idea , the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians .
It &apos;s a very powerful word , jihad , if you look at it in that respect , and there &apos;s a certain almost mystical resonance to it .
And that &apos;s the reason why , for hundreds of years , Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad , their daughters as much as their sons , in the same way that , say , Christians name their daughters Grace , and Hindus , my people , name our daughters Bhakti , which means , in Sanskrit , spiritual worship .
But there have always been , in Islam , a small group , a minority , who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith , or the faithul .
And some of these people believe that in that struggle , it is sometimes okay to take up arms .
And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country , in their minds they were fighting a jihad , they were doing jihad , and they named themselves the Mujahideen , which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad .
And we forget this now , but back then the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country , in America .
We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists .
America gave them weapons , gave them money , gave them support , encouragement .
But within that group , a tiny , smaller group , a minority within a minority within a minority , were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad , and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden , and he refined the idea .
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror , primarily targeted at the far enemy , at the crusaders from the West , against America .
And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous , so monstrous , and had such great impact , that his definition was the one that stuck , not just here in the West .
We didn &apos;t know any better . We didn &apos;t pause to ask .
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad , then that &apos;s what jihad must mean .
But it wasn &apos;t just us . Even in the Muslim world , his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance .
A year ago I was in Tunis , and I met the imam of a very small mosque , an old man .
Fifteen years ago , he named his granddaughter Jihad , after the old meaning . He hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life .
But he told me that after 9 / 11 , he began to have second thoughts .
He worried that if he called her by that name , especially outdoors , outside in public , he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden &apos;s idea of jihad .
On Fridays in his mosque , he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word , but his congregants , the people who came to his mosque , they had seen the videos . They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers , the towers coming down .
They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad , and claimed victory for it . And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears . No one was paying attention .
He was wrong . Some people were paying attention , but for the wrong reasons .
The United States , at this point , was putting pressure on all its Arab allies , including Tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the Tunisian intelligence service .
They had never paid him any attention before -- old man , small mosque -- but now they began to pay visits , and sometimes they would drag him in for questions , and always the same question : &quot; Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad ?
Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons ?
Do you hate Americans ?
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden ? &quot;
So to the Tunisian intelligence agency , and organizations like it all over the Arab world , jihad equaled extremism , Bin Laden &apos;s definition had become institutionalized .
That was the power of that word that he was able to do .
And it filled this old imam , it filled him with great sadness .
He told me that , of bin Laden &apos;s many crimes , this was , in his mind , one that didn &apos;t get enough attention , that he took this word , this beautiful idea .
He didn &apos;t so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be , and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad .
But the good news is that the global jihad is almost over , as bin Laden defined it .
It was dying well before he did , and now it &apos;s on its last legs .
Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West , against the far enemy .
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling .
The supply of money ‚Äî just as important , more important perhaps ‚Äî the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling .
The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous .
What does that mean for us in the West ?
Does it mean we can break out the champagne , wash our hands of it , disengage , sleep easy at night ?
No . Disengagement is not an option , because if you let local jihad survive , it becomes international jihad .
And so there &apos;s now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world .
In Somalia , in Mali , in Nigeria , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , Pakistan , there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden .
They use his rhetoric .
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , there &apos;s an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
There are other groups -- in Nigeria , Boko Haram , in Somalia , al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden .
But if you look closely , they &apos;re not fighting a global jihad .
They &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism , or it &apos;s a power struggle .
More often than not , it &apos;s a power struggle in one country , or even a small region within one country .
Occasionally they will go across a border , from Iraq to Syria , from Mali to Algeria , from Somalia to Kenya , but they &apos;re not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can relax .
I was in Yemen recently , where -- it &apos;s the home of the last al Qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack America , attack the West .
It &apos;s old school al Qaeda .
You may remember these guys .
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here , and they were using the Internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims .
But they have been distracted recently .
Last year , they took control over a portion of southern Yemen , and ran it , Taliban-style .
And then the Yemeni military got its act together , and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out , and since then , most of their activities , most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis .
So I think we &apos;ve come to a point now where we can say that , just like all politics , all jihad is local .
But that &apos;s still not reason for us to disengage , because we &apos;ve seen that movie before , in Afghanistan .
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union , we disengaged .
And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne , the Taliban had taken over in Kabul , and we said , &quot; Local jihad , not our problem . &quot;
And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden . He made it our problem .
Local jihad , if you ignore it , becomes global jihad again .
The good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
We know how to fight it now .
We have the tools . We have the knowhow , and we can take the lessons we &apos;ve learned from the fight against global jihad , the victory against global jihad , and apply those to local jihad .
What are those lessons ? We know who killed bin Laden : SEAL Team Six .
Do we know , do we understand , who killed bin Ladenism ?
Who ended the global jihad ?
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Let &apos;s start with bin Laden himself .
He probably thought 9 / 11 was his greatest achievement .
In reality , it was the beginning of the end for him .
He killed 3,000 innocent people , and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion , and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream .
He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community .
9 / 11 didn &apos;t empower him ; it doomed him .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it .
He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans but Iraqis . Muslims . Sunni as well as Shiites .
Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims .
Who killed Osama bin Laden ? The SEAL Team Six .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Al Jazeera did , Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
Al Jazeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? The Arab Spring did , because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change in a manner that Osama bin Laden , with his limited imagination , could never have conceived .
Who defeated the global jihad ? The American military did , the American soldiers did , with their allies , fighting in faraway battlefields .
And perhaps , a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it .
So all these factors , and many more besides , we don &apos;t even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism , the global jihad , you needed this group effort .
Now , not all of these things will work in local jihad .
The American military is not going to march into Nigeria to take on Boko Haram , and it &apos;s unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel into the homes of al Shabaab &apos;s leaders and take them out .
But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before . Half the work is already done .
We don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited .
We don &apos;t have to go back to that .
Satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways .
And the Arab Spring has produced governments , many of them Islamist governments , who know that , for their own self-preservation , they need to take on the extremists in their midsts .
We don &apos;t need to persuade them , but we do need to help them , because they haven &apos;t really come to this place before .
The good news , again , is that a lot of the things they need we already have , and we are very good at giving : economic assistance , not just money , but expertise , technology , knowhow , private investment , fair terms of trade , medicine , education , technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective , for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient .
We &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
Some of the other things that they need we &apos;re not very good at giving . Maybe nobody is .
Time , patience , subtlety , understanding -- these are harder to give .
I live in New York now . Just this week , posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage .
But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East , I have never been as optimistic as I am today that the gap between the Muslim world and the West is narrowing fast , and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that , because I know there are millions , hundreds of millions of people , Muslims like that old imam in Tunis , who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original , beautiful purpose .
Bin Laden is dead . Bin Ladenism has been defeated .
His definition of jihad can now be expunged .
To that jihad we can say , &quot; Goodbye . Good riddance . &quot;
To the real jihad we can say , &quot; Welcome back . Good luck . &quot;
Thank you .
How many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader ?
See , I &apos;ve asked that question all the way across the country , and everywhere I ask it , no matter where , there &apos;s always a huge portion of the audience that won &apos;t put up their hand .
And I &apos;ve come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us .
We &apos;ve made into something beyond us .
We &apos;ve made it about changing the world .
And we &apos;ve taken this title of leader , and we treat it as if it &apos;s something that one day we &apos;re going to deserve , but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we &apos;re not comfortable with .
And I worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we &apos;ve convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating , and we start to devalue the things that we can do every day , and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don &apos;t let ourselves take credit for it , and we don &apos;t let ourselves feel good about it .
And I &apos;ve been lucky enough over the last 10 years to work with some amazing people who have helped me redefine leadership in a way that I think has made me happier .
And with my short time today , I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition .
I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville , New Brunswick , and on my last day there , a girl came up to me and she said , &quot; I remember the first time that I met you . &quot;
And then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier .
She said , &quot; On the day before I started university , I was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad , and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn &apos;t do this , that I wasn &apos;t ready for university , that I just burst into tears .
And my mom and my dad were amazing . They were like , &apos; Look , we know you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
Let &apos;s go to the first day , and if at any point you feel as if you can &apos;t do this , that &apos;s fine , just tell us , we will take you home . We love you no matter what . &apos; &quot; And she says , &quot; So I went the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration , and I looked around and I just knew I couldn &apos;t do it .
I knew I wasn &apos;t ready . I knew I had to quit . &quot;
And she says , &quot; I made that decision , and as soon as I made it , there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me .
And I turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home , and just at that moment , you came out of the Student Union building wearing the stupidest hat I have ever seen in my life . &quot;
&quot; It was awesome .
And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama , which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis , &quot; ‚Äî a charity I &apos;ve worked with for years ‚Äî &quot; and you had a bucketful of lollipops .
And you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about Shinerama .
And all of a sudden , you got to me , and you just stopped , and you stared . It was creepy . &quot;
This girl right here knows exactly what I &apos;m talking about .
&quot; And then you looked at the guy next to me , and you smiled , and you reached in your bucket , and you pulled out a lollipop , and you held it out to him , and you said , &apos; You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you . &apos; &quot; And she said , &quot; I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life .
He turned beet red , and he wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this . &quot;
&quot; And I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop , and as soon as I did , you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &apos; Look at that . Look at that .
First day away from home , and already she &apos;s taking candy from a stranger ? ! &apos; &quot; And she said , &quot; Everybody lost it . Twenty feet in every direction , everyone started to howl .
And I know this is cheesy , and I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m telling you this , but in that moment when everyone was laughing , I knew that I shouldn &apos;t quit .
I knew that I was where I was supposed to be , and I knew that I was home , and I haven &apos;t spoken to you once in the four years since that day , but I heard that you were leaving , and I had to come up and tell you that you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , and I &apos;m going to miss you . Good luck . &quot;
And she walks away , and I &apos;m flattened .
And she gets about six feet away , she turns around and smiles , and goes , &quot; You should probably know this , too .
I &apos;m still dating that guy four years later . &quot;
A year and a half after I moved to Toronto , I got an invitation to their wedding .
Here &apos;s the kicker . I don &apos;t remember that .
I have no recollection of that moment , and I &apos;ve searched my memory banks , because that is funny and I should remember doing it , and I don &apos;t remember it .
And that was such an eye-opening , transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact I &apos;d ever had on anyone &apos;s life , a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say , &quot; You &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , &quot; was a moment that I didn &apos;t even remember .
How many of you guys have a lollipop moment , a moment where someone said something or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better ?
All right . How many of you have told that person they did it ?
See , why not ? We celebrate birthdays , where all you have to do is not die for 365 days ‚Äî ‚Äî and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it .
And every single one of you , every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment .
You have made someone &apos;s life better by something that you said or that you did , and if you think you haven &apos;t , think about all the hands that didn &apos;t go back up when I asked that question .
You &apos;re just one of the people who hasn &apos;t been told .
But it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful .
It can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people , because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us , as long as we keep leadership something beyond us , as long as we make it about changing the world , we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other .
Marianne Williamson said , &quot; Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate .
Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
It is our light , and not our darkness , that frightens us . &quot;
And my call to action today is that we need to get over that .
We need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other &apos;s lives .
We need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little sisters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other &apos;s lives more than money and power and titles and influence .
We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments , how many of them we create , how many of them we acknowledge , how many of them we pay forward , and how many of them we say thank you for .
Because we &apos;ve made leadership about changing the world , and there is no world . There &apos;s only six billion understandings of it , and if you change one person &apos;s understanding of it , one person &apos;s understanding of what they &apos;re capable of , one person &apos;s understanding of how much people care about them , one person &apos;s understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world , you &apos;ve changed the whole thing .
And if we can understand leadership like that , I think if we can redefine leadership like that , I think we can change everything .
And it &apos;s a simple idea , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a small one , and I want to thank you all so much for letting me share it with you today .
I &apos;ve always wanted to be a cyborg .
One of my favorite shows as a kid was &quot; The Six Million Dollar Man , &quot; and this is a little bit closer to the 240 dollar man or so , but -- At at any rate . I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky wearing this around , but a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here , so I figure it &apos;s OK amongst this group .
But that &apos;s not what I want to talk about today .
I want to talk about toys , and the power that I see inherent in them .
When I was a kid , I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta , Georgia .
And at the time I didn &apos;t think much about it , but then later , I realized that that was the high point of my education .
From that point on , everything else was pretty much downhill .
And it wasn &apos;t until later , as I started making games , that -- I really actually think of them more as toys .
People call me a game designer , but I really think of these things more as toys .
But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods , and the way she went about things , and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly .
And she would design these toys , where kids in playing with the toys would actually come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play .
And since they discovered those things , it really stuck with them so much more , and also they would experience their own failures ; there was a failure-based aspect to learning there . It was very important .
And so , the games that I do , I think of really more as modern Montessori toys .
And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles .
So a few years ago , I actually started getting very interested in the SETI program . And that &apos;s the way I work .
I get interested in different kinds of subjects , I dive in , I research them , and then I try to figure out how to craft a toy around that , so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as I did as I was learning that subject .
And it kind of led me to astrobiology , which is the study of possible life in the universe .
And then Drake &apos;s Equation , which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets , how long it might last , how many planets are out there , stuff like that .
And I started looking at how interesting Drake &apos;s Equation was , because it spanned all these different subjects -- physics , chemistry , sociology , economics , astronomy .
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was &quot; Powers of Ten , &quot; Charles and Ray Eames &apos; film .
And I started putting those two together and wondering , could I build a toy where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life , as it exists and as it might go in the future .
Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican Principle , the Fermi Paradox , the Anthropic Principle , the origin of life .
And so I &apos;m going to show you a toy today that I &apos;ve been working on , that I think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .
In playing this toy , you kind of -- this will bring up philosophical questions in you .
This game &apos;s called &quot; Spore . &quot; I &apos;ve been working on it for several years .
It &apos;s getting pretty close to finished now .
It occurs at all these different scales , first of all , from very , very small to very , very large .
I &apos;m just going to pop in at the start of the game .
And you actually start this game in a drop of water , as a very , very small single-cell creature , and right off the bat you basically just have to live , survive , reproduce .
So here we are , at a very microscopic scale , swimming around . And I actually realize that cells don &apos;t have eyes , but it helps to make it cute .
The players are going to play through every generation of this species , and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit .
And as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out , and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground , showing you a little bit of what you &apos;ll be interacting with as you grow .
So as we eat , the camera starts pulling out , and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms .
Now , we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
I &apos;m going to skip ahead here . At some point we get larger , and we actually get to a macro-evolution scale .
Now at this point we &apos;re leaving the water , and one thing that &apos;s kind of important about this game is that , at every level , the player is designing their creature , and that &apos;s a fundamental aspect of this .
Now , in the evolution game here , the creature scale , basically you have to eat , survive , and then reproduce . You know , very Darwinian .
One thing we noticed with &quot; The Sims , &quot; which is a game I did earlier , is that players love making stuff .
When they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it . Even if it wasn &apos;t as pretty as what other people would make it -- as a professional artist would make for games -- it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it .
So at this point , we &apos;ve left the water , and now with this little creature -- we could bring up the volume a little bit -- and now we might try to eat .
We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe , and try and eat him .
OK , well , we fight .
OK , we got him . Now we get a meal .
So really , at this part of the game , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re running around and surviving , and also getting to the next generation , because we &apos;re going to play through every generation of this creature .
We can mate , so I &apos;m going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me . Yeah .
We didn &apos;t want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that , because it &apos;s almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution .
Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through , but really it represents this huge set of possibilities .
Now once we mate , we click on the egg .
And this is where the game starts getting interesting , because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high-leverage tools , so that for a very small amount of effort the player can make something very cool . And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side .
But basically , this is the editor where we &apos;re going to design the next generation of our creature . So it has a little spine .
I can move around here . I can extend .
I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel , so you sculpt it like clay . We have parts here that I can put on or pull off .
The idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor , and we &apos;ll basically bring it to life .
So , for instance , I might put some limbs on the character here .
I &apos;ll inflate them kind of large .
And in this case I might decide I &apos;m going to put -- I &apos;ll put mouths on the limbs .
So pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game .
Here , I &apos;ll give it one eye in the middle , maybe scale it up a bit . Point it down .
And I &apos;ll also give it a few legs .
So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player &apos;s imagination , so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn &apos;t really think was possible before .
You know , this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight-year-old can use .
But really the goal here was , within about a minute , I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .
OK , now I &apos;ll put some hands on it .
OK , so here I &apos;ve basically thrown together a little creature .
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here , so it can fight .
OK , so that &apos;s the complete model . Now we can actually go to the painting phase .
Now , at this phase , the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature . It kind of knows where the backbone is , where the spine , the limbs are .
It kind of knows how stripes should run , how it should be shaded .
And so we &apos;re procedurally generating the texture map , and this is something a texture artist would take many , many days to work on .
And then we can test it out , once we &apos;ve done that , and see how it would move around .
And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature .
It &apos;s looking at whatever I &apos;ve designed . It will actually bring it to life .
And I can see how it might dance .
how it might show emotions , how it might fight .
So it &apos;s acting with its two mouths there .
I can even have it pose for a photo . Snap a little photo of it .
So at any rate , then I bring this back into the game . It &apos;s born , and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution .
Now again , the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous . Now , when players create content in this game , it &apos;s automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently .
So in fact , as I &apos;m interacting in this world with other creatures , these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play .
So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content . And pretty much everything you &apos;re going to see in this game , there &apos;s an editor for in the game that the player can create , all the way up through civilization . This is my baby .
When I eat , I &apos;ll actually start growing . This is the next generation .
But I &apos;m going to skip way ahead here . Now , normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up , eventually become intelligent .
I &apos;d start dealing with tribes , cities and civilizations of them over time .
I &apos;m going to skip way ahead here to the space phase .
Eventually they would go out into space , and start colonizing and exploring the universe .
Now really , in some sense , I want the players to be building this world in their imagination , and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain .
So that &apos;s kind of what these tools are about , are : how do we make the game play the player &apos;s imagination-amplifier ?
And how do we make these tools , these editors , something that are just as fun as the game itself ?
So this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here .
Now , at this point we &apos;re actually dealing with a very little toy planet .
Almost , again , like the Montessori toy idea .
You know , what happens if you give somebody a toy planet , and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it , what could they discover ? What might they learn on this ?
This world was actually extracted from the player &apos;s imagination .
So , this is the planet that the player evolved on .
Things like the buildings , and the vehicles , the architecture , civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point .
So here &apos;s a little city with some of our guys kind of walking around in it .
And most games kind of put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker , this protagonist playing through this story .
Really , this is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas , you know ?
I want them , after they &apos;ve played this game , to have extracted an entire world that they &apos;re now interacting with .
Now , as we pull down here , we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet . There are all these different dynamics going on here .
In fact , I can look over here , and this is kind of a little simplified food web that &apos;s going on with the creatures .
I can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface , and get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in .
Some of these were created by the player , others by other players and automatically sent over here .
But there &apos;s a very simple little kind of calculation of what &apos;s required , how much plants are required for the herbivores to live , how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat , etc . , that you actually have to balance actively .
Now also with this phase , we &apos;re getting more and more God-like powers for the player , and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy .
So I can come in and I can do things , and just treat this planet as a lump of clay .
We have very simple little weather systems you see here , very simple geology . For instance , I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers .
So this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay , a sculpture .
I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .
So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere , and so that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here .
There &apos;s actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere , pressure and temperature .
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere , we &apos;re going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you &apos;ll start noticing , we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time .
And our cities are going to be at risk too , because a lot of these are coastal cities .
You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities , I &apos;ll start losing cities here .
So basically , I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space . So there goes one city .
Now over time , this is actually going to heat up the planet .
So at first what we &apos;re going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet , but then over time -- I can speed it up just a little bit -- we &apos;ll actually see the heat impact of that as well .
So not only will it get hotter , but at some point it &apos;s going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate .
So at first they &apos;ll go up , and then they &apos;ll evaporate , and that &apos;ll be my planet .
So basically , what we &apos;re getting here is the sequel to &quot; An Inconvenient Truth , &quot; in about two minutes , and that actually brings up an interesting point about games .
Now here , our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface , and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet &apos;s going to melt down .
Here it goes .
So we &apos;re not only simulating biological dynamics -- food webs and all that -- but also geologic , you know , on a very simple core scale .
And what &apos;s interesting to me about games , in some sense , is that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics and compress them into very short-term kind of experiences .
Because it &apos;s so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out , but when you can give them a toy , and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes , I think it &apos;s an entirely different kind of point of view , where we &apos;re actually mapping , using the game to re-map our intuition .
It &apos;s almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight ; I think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time .
So here &apos;s our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
We actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system .
Let &apos;s fly to another one .
So in fact , we &apos;re going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here . Now , as we move into the future , we &apos;re drawing a lot from things like science fiction .
And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to basically play out here as different dynamics .
So this planet actually has some life on it .
Here it is , some indigenous life down here .
Now one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down .
Now as you can see , these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it , and over time , once they touch it , they will become intelligent .
So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient .
You see , now they &apos;ve actually gone to tribal dynamics .
And now , because I &apos;m actually the one here , I can , if I want to , get out of the UFO and walk up , and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god .
At first they &apos;re a little freaked out .
OK , well maybe they &apos;re not worshipping me .
I think I &apos;ll leave before they get hostile .
But we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this .
Basically , I want to be able to play , &quot; The Day the Earth Stood Still , &quot; &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey , &quot; &quot; Star Trek , &quot; &quot; War Of the Worlds . &quot;
Now as we pull away from this world -- we &apos;re going to keep pulling away from the star now .
One of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static . As we pull away from the star here , we &apos;re actually going now out into interstellar space , and we &apos;re getting a sense of the space around our home star .
Now what I really wanted to do is to present this , basically as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is .
And not only that , but also show the dynamics , and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find , maybe like in the Hubble , at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales .
So most people have no idea of the difference between like , an emission nebula and a planetary nebula .
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .
So we &apos;re flying over here to what looks like a black hole .
I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with , again , as toys .
So here &apos;s a little black hole that we probably don &apos;t want to get too close to .
But we also have stars and things as well .
If we pull all the way back , we start seeing the entire galaxy here , kind of slowly in motion . And this is another thing where , typically when people present galaxies , it &apos;s always been these very beautiful photos , but they &apos;re always static . And when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it , it &apos;s actually kind of amazing , what a galaxy would look like , fast forwarded .
This would be about one million years a second , because you have about roughly one supernova every century or so .
And so you &apos;d have this wonderful sparkling thing , with the disk slowly rotating , and this is roughly what it would look like . And so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imaginative way , so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time .
Chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become .
Because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to have 15-year-olds , 20-year-olds , whatever , flying around this universe .
And they might be a nurturing god . They might be boot-strapping life on planets , trying to terra-form and spread civilization .
You might be a vengeful god and going out and conquesting , because you actually can do that , you can go in and attack other intelligent races .
You might be a networking god , building alliances , which you can also do in the game , or just curious , going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can .
But basically , the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there &apos;s one difference I could possibly make in the world , that I would choose to make , it &apos;s that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking .
Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking , and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 , 100 , or 1,000 years out .
And I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics , very long-term dynamics over the short term , and getting some sense of what we &apos;re doing now , what it &apos;s going to be like in 100 years , I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world .
And so that &apos;s why I think , personally , that toys can change the world .
Thank you .
We conventionally divide space into private and public realms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we &apos;ve become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
But we &apos;re less attuned to the nuances of the public .
What translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
I mean , this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade .
And we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backward And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that &apos;s grown out of sync with its time .
We &apos;ve been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn &apos;t usually have $ 300 to spend on an opera ticket .
So we &apos;ve been eating , drinking , thinking , living public space for quite a long time .
And it &apos;s taught us really one thing , and that is to truly make good public space , you have to erase the distinctions between architecture , urbanism , landscape , media design and so on .
It really goes beyond distinction .
Now we &apos;re moving onto Washington , D.C.
and we &apos;re working on another transformation , and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that &apos;s sited on the most revered public space in America , the National Mall .
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy .
And what &apos;s fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it &apos;s not an image , it &apos;s not an artifact , actually it &apos;s a space , and it &apos;s kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
It &apos;s a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power .
It &apos;s a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place .
And they &apos;re inscribed in there forever -- like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there .
The Vietnam protests , the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS , the march for women &apos;s reproductive rights , right up until almost the present .
The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent .
And it &apos;s synonymous with free speech , even if you &apos;re not sure what it is that you have to say .
It may just be a place for civic commiseration .
There is a huge disconnect , we believe , between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side .
And that is that those museums are usually passive , they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience , as the receiver of information .
And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that , but you &apos;re really not involved ; you &apos;re being talked to .
When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009 , he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place : at the seat of power in the U.S.
And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time , there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness .
The question is , is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs ?
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy ?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks .
There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into , and somehow through , the museum .
There should be some kind of brain trust .
So the Hirshhorn , as we began to think about it , and as we evolved the mission , with Richard and his team -- it &apos;s really his life blood .
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art , the Hirshhorn will become a public forum , a place of discourse for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
It would have the informality of the town square .
And for this new initiative , the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary , deployable structure .
This is it . This is the Hirshhorn -- so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early &apos; 70s by Gordon Bunshaft .
It &apos;s hulking , it &apos;s silent , it &apos;s cloistered , it &apos;s arrogant , it &apos;s a design challenge .
Architects love to hate it .
One redeeming feature is it &apos;s lifted up off the ground and it &apos;s got this void , and it &apos;s got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style .
And around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
Very , very difficult to mount shows in there .
When the Hirshhorn opened , Ada Louise Huxstable , the New York Times critic , had some choice words : &quot; Neo-penitentiary modern . &quot;
&quot; A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection . &quot;
Almost four decades later , how will this building expand for a new progressive program ?
Where would it go ?
It can &apos;t go in the Mall .
There is no space there .
It can &apos;t go in the courtyard .
It &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
Well there &apos;s always the hole .
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly ?
How could it become iconic ?
And what language would it take ?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall &apos;s momumental institutions .
Most are neoclassical , heavy and opaque , made of stone or concrete .
And the question is , if one inhabits that space , what is the material of the Mall ?
It has to be different from the buildings there .
It has to be something entirely different .
It has to be air .
In our imagination , it has to be light .
It has to be ephemeral . It has to be formless .
And it has to be free .
So this is the big idea .
It &apos;s a giant airbag .
The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can -- the top and sides .
But more poetically , we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall , bringing it into itself .
The before and the after .
It was dubbed &quot; the bubble &quot; by the press .
That was the lounge .
It &apos;s basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction .
The membrane is translucent .
It &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
And it &apos;s inflated twice a year for one month at a time .
This is the view from the inside .
So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government .
It had to be approved by actually two agencies .
And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall .
I blush whenever I show this .
It is yours to interpret .
But one thing I can say is that it &apos;s a combination of iconoclasm and adoration .
There was also some creative interpretation involved .
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in D.C.
to 130 feet , except for spires , towers , domes and minarettes .
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state .
And the bubble is 153 ft .
That &apos;s the Pantheon next to it .
It &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome .
So there it is , very stately , among all the stately buildings in the Mall .
And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked , it &apos;s very , very historically sensitive .
And so we couldn &apos;t really touch its surfaces .
We couldn &apos;t leave any traces behind .
So we strained it from the edges , and we held it by cables .
It &apos;s a study of some bondage techniques , which are actually very , very important because it &apos;s hit by wind all the time .
There &apos;s one permanent steel ring at the top , but it can &apos;t be seen from any vantage point on the Mall .
There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
It glows from within , it &apos;s translucent .
But it can &apos;t be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments .
So it &apos;s down the hierarchy on lighting .
So it comes to the site twice a year .
It &apos;s taken off the delivery truck .
It &apos;s hoisted .
And then it &apos;s inflated with this low-pressure air .
And then it &apos;s restrained with the cables .
And then it &apos;s ballasted with water at the very bottom .
This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install .
And we said , well the first erection would take one week .
And they really connected with that idea .
And then it was really easy all the way through .
So we didn &apos;t really have that many hurdles , I have to say , with the government and all the authorities .
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
This is the warp and weft .
This is a point cloud .
There are extreme pressures .
This is a very , very unusual building in that there &apos;s no gravity load , but there &apos;s load in every direction .
And I &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
And this is the space in action .
So flexible interior for discussions , just like this , but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable .
Could be used for anything , for performances , films , for installations .
And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations .
Form and content are together here .
The bubble is an anti-monument .
The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity .
Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls , but inside of the museum &apos;s core , blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall .
And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013 .
Thank you .
There have been many revolutions over the last century , but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution .
We are living on average today 34 years longer than our great-grandparents did .
Think about that .
That &apos;s an entire second adult lifetime that &apos;s been added to our lifespan .
And yet , for the most part , our culture has not come to terms with what this means .
We &apos;re still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch .
That &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
You &apos;re born , you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude .
Age as pathology .
But many people today -- philosophers , artists , doctors , scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act , the last three decades of life .
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time ?
How do we live it successfully ?
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging ?
I &apos;ve spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase -- the upward ascension of the human spirit , bringing us into wisdom , wholeness and authenticity .
Age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
And guess what ?
This potential is not for the lucky few .
It turns out , most people over 50 feel better , are less stressed , are less hostile , less anxious .
We tend to see commonalities more than differences .
Some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
This is not what I expected , trust me .
I come from a long line of depressives .
As I was approaching my late 40s , when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative .
And I got scared .
I thought , oh my gosh .
I &apos;m going to become a crotchety old lady .
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act , I realize I &apos;ve never been happier .
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
And I &apos;ve discovered that when you &apos;re inside oldness , as opposed to looking at it from the outside , fear subsides .
You realize , you &apos;re still yourself -- maybe even more so .
Picasso once said , &quot; It takes a long time to become young . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
Obviously , there &apos;s no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .
Some of it is a matter of luck .
Some of it , obviously , is genetic .
One third of it , in fact , is genetic .
And there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
But that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act , we can do something about .
We &apos;re going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference .
Now let me say something about the staircase , which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs .
Myself included .
As you may know , the entire world operates on a universal law : entropy , the second law of thermodynamics .
Entropy means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of decline and decay , the arch .
There &apos;s only one exception to this universal law , and that is the human spirit , which can continue to evolve upwards -- the staircase -- bringing us into wholeness , authenticity and wisdom .
And here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges .
About three years ago , I read an article in the New York Times .
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old , a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer &apos;s voice .
Two years later , he was diagnosed with ALS , commonly known as Lou Gehrig &apos;s disease .
It &apos;s a terrible disease . It &apos;s fatal .
It wastes the body , but the mind remains intact .
In this article , Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him .
And I quote , &quot; As my muscles weakened , my writing became stronger .
As I slowly lost my speech , I gained my voice .
As I diminished , I grew .
As I lost so much , I finally started to find myself . &quot;
Neil Selinger , to me , is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act .
Now we &apos;re all born with spirit , all of us , but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life , violence , abuse , neglect .
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression .
Perhaps they weren &apos;t able to love us beyond how we performed in the world .
Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain , a wound .
Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure .
And so we can feel unfinished .
Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves .
For me , it began as I was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
How was I supposed to live it ?
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
And I realized that , in order to know where I was going , I had to know where I &apos;d been .
And so I went back and I studied my first two acts , trying to see who I was then , who I really was -- not who my parents or other people told me I was , or treated me like I was .
But who was I ? Who were my parents -- not as parents , but as people ?
Who were my grandparents ?
How did they treat my parents ?
These kinds of things .
I discovered a couple of years later that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists &quot; doing a life review . &quot;
And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person &apos;s life .
You may discover , as I did , that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault , a lot of things you used to think about yourself , really had nothing to do with you .
It wasn &apos;t your fault ; you &apos;re just fine .
And you &apos;re able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself .
You &apos;re able to free yourself from your past .
You can work to change your relationship to your past .
Now while I was writing about this , I came upon a book called &quot; Man &apos;s Search for Meaning &quot; by Viktor Frankl .
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who &apos;d spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp .
And he wrote that , while he was in the camp , he could tell , should they ever be released , which of the people would be okay and which would not .
And he wrote this : &quot; Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing , your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation .
This is what determines the quality of the life we &apos;ve lived -- not whether we &apos;ve been rich or poor , famous or unknown , healthy or suffering .
What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities , what kind of meaning we assign them , what kind of attitude we cling to about them , what state of mind we allow them to trigger . &quot;
Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try , if appropriate , to change our relationship to the past .
It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this , it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain .
You see , if you have , over time , reacted negatively to past events and people , neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain .
And over time , these neural pathways become hardwired , they become the norm -- even if it &apos;s bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety .
If however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-vision our relationship to past people and events , neural pathways can change .
And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past , that becomes the new norm .
It &apos;s like resetting a thermostat .
It &apos;s not having experiences that make us wise , it &apos;s reflecting on the experiences that we &apos;ve had that makes us wise -- and that helps us become whole , brings wisdom and authenticity .
It helps us become what we might have been .
Women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
I mean , as girls , we start off feisty -- &quot; Yeah , who says ? &quot;
We have agency .
We are the subjects of our own lives .
But very often , many , if not most of us , when we hit puberty , we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .
And we become the subjects and objects of other people &apos;s lives .
But now , in our third acts , it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time .
And if we can do that , it will not just be for ourselves .
Older women are the largest demographic in the world .
If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole , this will create a cultural shift in the world , and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a bug lover , myself -- not from childhood , by the way , but rather late .
When I bachelored , majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University , I kind of fell in love with bugs .
And then , within zoology , the science of insects .
And then I thought , myself , how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology ?
And then I moved to the world of plant protection -- plant protection from insects , from bad bugs .
And then within plant protection , I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests .
So it &apos;s a whole discipline in plant protection that &apos;s aiming at the reduction of chemicals .
or these good bugs that we are talking about , for a long , long time .
But only in the last 120 years people started , or people knew more and more how to exploit , or how to use , this biological control phenomenon , or in fact , natural control phenomenon , to their own needs .
Because biological control phenomenon , you can see it in your backyard .
Just take a magnifying glass . You see what I have here ?
That &apos;s a magnifier times 10 .
Yeah , times 10 .
Just open it .
You just twist leaves , and you see a whole new world of minute insects , or little spiders of one millimeter , one and a half , two millimeters long , and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones .
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .
Here , in front of this building , I &apos;m sure .
Just have a look at the plants .
So it &apos;s everywhere , and we need to know how to exploit it .
Well let us go hand by hand What is a pest ?
What damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
And what is the natural enemy , the biologically controlled agent , or the good bug , that we are talking about ?
In general , I &apos;m going to talk about insects and spiders , or mites , let us call them .
Insects , those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites , the eight-legged organisms .
Let &apos;s have a look at that .
Here is a pest , devastating pest , a spider mite , because it does a lot of webbing like a spider .
You see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-hand side .
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf , and on the middle , cotton leaf , and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .
They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking , piercing mouthparts of those spiders .
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite , by the way , one millimeter , two millimeters long , not more than that , running quickly , hunting , chasing the spider mites .
And here you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side -- just pierces , sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite .
And after five minutes , this is what you see : just a typical dead corpse , shriveled , sucked-out , dead corpse of the spider mite , and next to it , two satiated individuals of predatory mites , a mother on the left-hand side , a young nymph on the right-hand side .
By the way , a meal for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spider mites , of the bad mites , or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites .
By the way , they are hungry always .
And there is another example : aphids .
By the way , it &apos;s springtime now in Israel .
When temperature rises sharply , you can see those bad ones , those aphids , all over the plants , in your hibiscus , in your lantana , in the young , fresh foliage of the spring flush , so-called .
By the way , with aphids you have only females , like Amazons .
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
No males at all .
Parthenogenesis , &#91; as it &#93; was so called .
And they are very happy with that , apparently .
Here we can see the damage .
Those aphids secrete some sticky , sugary liquid called honeydew , and this just globs the upper parts of the plant .
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus , sooty mold , which is covering it .
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp .
Here we are not talking about a predator .
Here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite , This is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp flier .
And here you can see this parasite in action , like in an acrobatic maneuver .
She stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim at the right-hand side , bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg , a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid .
By the way , the aphid tries to escape .
She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids , but nothing will happen , in fact .
Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid .
And after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside .
This is all natural . This is all natural .
This is not fiction , nothing at all .
Again , in your backyard , in your backyard .
But this is the end result .
This is the end result : Mummies -- M-U-M-M-Y .
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside , in fact , a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out .
The birth is almost complete .
You can see , by the way , in different movies , etc . , it takes just a few minutes .
And if this is a female , she &apos;ll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short .
This female can live only three to four days , and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs .
That means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids .
And this is of course not the end of it .
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example .
Again , we &apos;ll start first with the pest : the thrips .
By the way , all these weird names -- I didn &apos;t bother you with the Latin names of these creatures , okay , just the popular names .
But this is a nice , slender , very bad pest .
If you can see this , sweet peppers .
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper .
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .
And here comes the natural enemy , minute pirate bug , &quot; minute &quot; because it is rather small .
Here you can see the adult , black , and two young ones .
And again , in action .
This adult pierces the thrips , sucking it within just several minutes , just going to the other prey , continuing all over the place .
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pepper plot , they go to the flowers .
And look , this flower is flooded with predatory bugs , with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones , the thrips .
So this is a very positive situation , by the way .
No harm to the developing fruit . No harm to the fruit set .
Everything is just fine under these circumstances .
But again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy .
What we do is actually this .
In Northeast Israel , in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu , there is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies .
In other words , what we do there , we amplify , we amplify the natural control , or the biological control phenomenon .
And in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses , there , we are mass-producing those predatory mites , those minute pirate bugs , those parasitic wasps , etc . , etc .
Many different parts .
By the way , they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand , and a good , mild winter and a nice , hot summer , which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .
And by the way , mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation .
There are no GMOs -- Genetically Modified Organisms -- whatsoever .
We take them from nature , and the only thing that we do , we give them the optimal conditions , under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms , in order to proliferate , multiply and reproduce .
And that &apos;s what we get , in fact .
You see under a microscope .
You see in the upper left corner , you see a single predatory mite .
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
You see this ampoule . You see this one .
I have one gram of those predatory mites .
One gram &apos;s 80,000 individuals , 80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre , 4,000 square meters , of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year .
And we can produce from this , believe you me , several dozens of kilograms So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon .
And no , we do not disrupt the balance .
On the contrary , because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals .
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And what is the impact ?
In this table , you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .
For example , in Israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in Israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .
And Israeli strawberries , even more -- 80 percent of the pesticides , especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries .
So the impact is very strong .
And there goes the question , especially if you ask growers , agriculturists : Why biological control ?
Why good bugs ?
By the way , the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask .
But if we go , for example , to this place , Southeast Israel , the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley , where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located , especially under greenhouse conditions , or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat , you see this just in the middle of the desert .
And if you zoom in , you can definitely watch this , grandparents with their grandchildren , distributing the natural enemies , the good bugs , instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals .
So safety , with respect to the application , this is the number one answer that we get from growers , why biological control .
Number two , many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance , that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals , just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics .
It &apos;s the same , and it can happen very quickly .
Fortunately , in either biological control or even natural control , resistance is extremely rare .
It hardly happens .
Because this is evolution , this is the natural ratio , unlike resistance , which happens in the case of chemicals .
And thirdly , public demand .
Public demand -- the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals , the more growers become aware of the fact they should , wherever they can and wherever possible , replace the chemical control with biological control .
Even here , there is another grower , you see , very interested in the bugs , the bad ones and the good ones , wearing this magnifier already on her head , just walking safely in her crop .
Finally , I want to get actually to my vision , or in fact , to my dream .
Because , you see , this is the reality .
Have a look at the gap .
If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide , it &apos;s 250 million dollars .
And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world .
I think it &apos;s times 100 or something like that .
Twenty-five billion .
So there is a huge gap to bridge .
So actually , how can we do it ?
How can we bridge , or let &apos;s say , narrow , this gap in the course of the years ?
First of all , we need to find more robust , good and reliable biological solutions , more good bugs that we can either mass-produce or actually conserve in the field .
Secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
And thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .
And this gap really narrows .
Step by step , it does narrow .
So I think my last slide is : All we are saying , we can actually sing it : Give nature a chance .
So I &apos;m saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers , in Israel and abroad , really give nature a chance .
Thank you .
You &apos;ve all seen lots of articles on climate change , and here &apos;s yet another New York Times article , just like every other darn one you &apos;ve seen .
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
What &apos;s unusual about this one , maybe , is that it &apos;s from 1953 .
And the reason I &apos;m saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent .
That people have just sort of figured out about it , and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something , we may be on the road to a solution .
The fact is -- uh-uh .
We &apos;ve known about this problem for 50 years , depending on how you count it .
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so .
And we &apos;ve accomplished close to zip .
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere .
You &apos;ve seen this in various forms , but maybe you haven &apos;t seen this one .
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
And that it &apos;s accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back .
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible , that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line .
But in fact , they &apos;re growing faster .
Here &apos;s some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year &apos;s minimum of the Arctic Sea ice , and it &apos;s the lowest by far .
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models .
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel , and politicians signing treaties -- in fact , you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative , because it &apos;s just consumed a lot of jet fuel .
No , no ! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we &apos;ve really hardly started .
Really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . Really , not very much .
I don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
The problem is absolutely soluble , and even soluble in a way that &apos;s reasonably cheap .
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP .
No , this is really important to have this sense of scale .
So the problem is soluble , and the way we should go about solving it is , say , dealing with electricity production , which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions .
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation , and wind power , nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture , which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment , and work .
All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place .
Instead , we spend our time talking .
But nevertheless , that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk to you about tonight .
What I &apos;m going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing .
And it &apos;s this stuff in the middle here , which is what you do if you don &apos;t stop the emissions quickly enough .
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions that change climate , and the climate change itself . And that &apos;s particularly important because , of course , while we can adapt to climate change -- and it &apos;s important to be honest here , there will be some benefits to climate change .
Oh , yes , I think it &apos;s bad . I &apos;ve spent my whole life working to stop it .
But one of the reasons it &apos;s politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers .
But , of course , the natural world , polar bears .
I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic .
They will completely lose .
And there &apos;s no adaption .
So this problem is absolutely soluble .
This geo-engineering idea , in it &apos;s simplest form , is basically the following .
You could put signed particles , say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates -- into the upper atmosphere , the stratosphere , where they &apos;d reflect away sunlight and cool the planet .
And I know for certain that that will work .
Not that there aren &apos;t side effects , but I know for certain it will work .
And the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
And it was done not by us , not by me , but by nature .
Here &apos;s Mount Pinatubo in the early &apos; 90s . That put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud .
The result of that was pretty dramatic .
After that , and some previous volcanoes we have , you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere .
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere , the stratosphere , and it heats up after these volcanoes .
But you &apos;ll notice that in the upper bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit .
There &apos;s no big mystery about it .
There &apos;s lots of mystery in the details , and there &apos;s some bad side effects , like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
But it clearly cools down .
And one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
It &apos;s really important to say . So much of the other things that we ought to do , like slowing emissions , are intrinsically slow , because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions .
And not only that , when you cut emissions , you don &apos;t cut concentrations , because concentrations , the amount of CO2 in the air , is the sum of emissions over time .
So you can &apos;t step on the brakes very quickly .
But if you do this , it &apos;s quick .
And there are times you might like to do something quick .
Another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2 , and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?
And the answer seems to be yes .
So here are the graphs you &apos;ve seen lots of times before .
That &apos;s what the world looks like , under one particular climate model &apos;s view , with twice the amount of CO2 in the air .
The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight , and you &apos;re back to the original climate .
And this graph from Ken Caldeira . It &apos;s important to say came , because Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid- &apos; 90s -- Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said , &quot; Geo-engineering won &apos;t work . &quot;
And to the person who was promoting it said , &quot; The atmosphere &apos;s much more complicated . &quot;
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn &apos;t do a very good compensation .
Ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
This topic is also old .
That report that landed on President Johnson &apos;s desk when I was two years old -- 1965 .
That report , in fact , which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering .
It didn &apos;t even talk about cutting emissions , which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem .
I &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t cut emissions .
We should , but it made exactly this point .
So , in a sense , there &apos;s not much new .
The one new thing is this essay .
So I should say , I guess , that since the time of that original President Johnson report , and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy -- 1977 , 1982 , 1990 -- people always talked about this idea .
Not as something that was foolproof , but as an idea to think about .
But when climate became , politically , a hot topic -- if I may make the pun -- in the last 15 years , this became so un-PC , we couldn &apos;t talk about it .
It just sunk below the surface . We weren &apos;t allowed to speak about it .
But in the last year , Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly what &apos;s all been said before : that maybe , given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts , we should think about things like this .
He said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry .
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this , even though there will be some ozone impacts .
And in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away .
There was all sorts of press coverage , all over the world , going right down to &quot; Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth , &quot; from the Economist .
And that got me thinking . I &apos;ve worked on this topic on and off , but not so much technically . And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night .
And I thought about this child &apos;s toy -- hence , the title of my talk -- and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin &apos; round in the child &apos;s radiometer , to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there .
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly .
The other problem is they &apos;re right in the ozone layer , and I &apos;d prefer them above the ozone layer .
And it turns out , I woke up the next morning , and I started to calculate this .
It was very hard to calculate from first principles . I was stumped .
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere .
So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere , about 100 kilometers up , that already have this effect .
I &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
There are a lot of fun complexities that I &apos;d love to spend the whole evening on , but I won &apos;t .
But let &apos;s say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it &apos;s unevenly heated .
So the side facing the sun is warmer ; the side away , cooler .
Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it &apos;s warm .
And so you see a net force away from the sun .
That &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit .
And of course , we may be wrong -- this hasn &apos;t all been peer reviewed , we &apos;re in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far , it seems good .
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes -- much longer than before -- because they &apos;re levitated .
We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere , in principle solving the ozone problem .
I &apos;m sure there will be other problems that arise .
Finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .
Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet , where we live , and do the maximum job of what we might need to do , which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency , if you like .
This is a new idea that &apos;s crept up that may be , essentially , a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in .
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right , I think it &apos;s almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in .
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this , it &apos;s amazing how we can affect the planet .
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage .
This improved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more leverage to affect the planet , to control the planet , to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it , not because we want it , just because science delivers it to us bit by bit , with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it .
Now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
Maybe they &apos;re going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here , or maybe they &apos;ll pick a smarter spot -- but suppose they arrive and they give you a box .
And the box has two knobs .
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations .
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box .
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
We have no global governance .
And different people will have different places they want it set .
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . It &apos;s not very likely .
But we &apos;re building that box .
The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs .
Even when they &apos;re doing it for other reasons .
Even when they &apos;re thinking they &apos;re just working on protecting the environment .
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet .
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not -- but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously .
Because sooner or later , we &apos;ll be confronted with decisions about this , and it &apos;s better if we think hard about it , even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it .
I &apos;ll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it .
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this .
We need a broader debate .
A debate that involves musicians , scientists , philosophers , writers , who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are .
So here &apos;s one way to think about it , which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it &apos;s cheaper .
I guess the thing I haven &apos;t said about this is , it is absurdly cheap .
It &apos;s conceivable that , say , using the sulfates method or this method I &apos;ve come up with , you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP .
It &apos;s very cheap . We have a lot of leverage .
It &apos;s not a good idea , but it &apos;s just important .
I &apos;ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big .
And that calculation isn &apos;t much in dispute .
You might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
So because of this , we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions , and just as the concentrations go up , we can increase the amount of geo-engineering .
I don &apos;t think anybody takes that seriously .
Because under this scenario , we walk further and further away from the current climate .
We have all sorts of other problems , like ocean acidification that come from CO2 in the atmosphere , anyway .
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this .
But here &apos;s a case which is harder to reject .
Let &apos;s say that we don &apos;t do geo-engineering , we do what we ought to do , which is get serious about cutting emissions .
But we don &apos;t really know how quickly we have to cut them .
There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
So let &apos;s say that we work hard , and we actually don &apos;t just tap the brakes , but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations .
And maybe someday -- like 2075 , October 23 -- we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side .
And we have global celebrations , and we &apos;ve actually started to -- you know , we &apos;ve seen the worst of it .
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast , fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years , and remove some of the biggest cities from the map .
That &apos;s an absolutely possible scenario .
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy , that it &apos;s a lot better than not geo-engineering .
And that &apos;s a very different way to look at the problem .
It &apos;s using this as risk control , not instead of action .
It &apos;s saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you &apos;d use it as a substitute for action .
But there is a problem with that view .
And the problem is the following : knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome , and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today .
This is what economists call a moral hazard .
And that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , I think it &apos;s the underlying reason that it &apos;s been politically unacceptable to talk about this .
But you don &apos;t make good policy by hiding things in a drawer .
I &apos;ll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
Should we do serious research on this topic ?
Should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
Not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
Right now , you have a few enthusiasts talking about it , some in a positive side , some in a negative side -- but that &apos;s a dangerous state to be in because there &apos;s very little depth of knowledge on this topic .
A very small amount of money would get us some .
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
But I have a lot of reservations .
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem , and I don &apos;t really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard .
I think there is a serious problem : as you talk about this , people begin to think they don &apos;t need to work so hard to cut emissions .
Another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
A treaty that decides who gets to do this .
Right now we may think of a big , rich country like the U.S. doing this .
But it might well be that , in fact , if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable , they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this , and they may just decide they &apos;d really rather have a geo-engineered world than a non-geo-engineered world .
And we &apos;ll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision .
So here &apos;s one last thought , which was said much , much better 25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today .
And I think it really summarizes where we are here .
That the CO2 problem , the climate problem that we &apos;ve heard about , is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also , I think , inevitably , it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control , whether we like it or not .
And it &apos;s time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we &apos;re thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn &apos;t do it .
Thank you very much .
So , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done with my life .
Thank you .
As a kid , I grew up on a farm in Florida , and I did what most little kids do .
I played a little baseball , did a few other things like that , but I always had the sense of being an outsider , and it wasn &apos;t until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate , I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s for me , &quot; you know ?
Because there was no coach standing directly over you , and these guys , they were just being themselves .
There was no opponent directly across from you .
And I loved that sense , so I started skating when I was about 10 years old , in 1977 , and when I did , I picked it up pretty quickly .
In fact , here &apos;s some footage from about 1984 .
It wasn &apos;t until &apos; 79 I won my first amateur championship , and then , by &apos; 81 , I was 14 , and I won my first world championship , which was amazing to me , and in a very real sense , that was the first real victory I had .
Oh , watch this .
This is a casper slide , where the board &apos;s upside down .
Mental note on that one .
And this one here ? An ollie .
So , as she mentioned , that is overstated for sure , but that &apos;s why they called me the godfather of modern street skating .
Here &apos;s some images of that .
Now , I was about halfway through my pro career in , I would say , the mid- &apos; 80s .
Freestyle itself , we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw , but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding , where guys were taking it to the streets , and they were using that ollie , like I showed you ? They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff .
So it was evolving upwards .
In fact , when someone tells you they &apos;re a skater today , they pretty much mean a street skater , because freestyle , it took about five years for it to die , and at that stage , I &apos;d been a &quot; champion &quot; champion for 11 years , which , phew !
And suddenly it was over for me . That &apos;s it .
It was gone . They took my pro model off the shelf , which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly .
That &apos;s how you make your money , you know ?
You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes . I had all that stuff , and it &apos;s gone .
The crazy thing was , there was a really liberating sense about it , because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion . &quot; Champion , &quot; again .
Champion sounds so goofy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
And I got to -- What drew me to skateboarding , the freedom was now restored , where I could just create things , because that &apos;s where the joy was for me , always , was creating new stuff .
The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks .
Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different .
So , as humbling and rotten as it was ‚Äî And believe me , it was rotten . I would go to skate spots , and I was already , like , &quot; famous guy , &quot; right ?
And everyone thought I was good . But in this new terrain , I was horrible . So people would go , &quot; Oh , he &apos;s all -- Oh , what happened to Mullen ? &quot;
So , humbling as it was , I began again .
Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain .
And again , there &apos;s this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me ‚Äî Oh , that one ?
That &apos;s , like , the hardest thing I &apos;ve ever done .
Okay , look at that . It &apos;s a darkslide .
See how it &apos;s sliding on the backside ?
Those are super-fun . And , actually , not that hard .
You know , at the very root of that , see , caspers , see how you throw it ?
Simple as that , right ? No biggie .
And your front foot , the way it grabs it , is -- I &apos;d seen someone slide on the back of the board like that , and I was like , &quot; How can I get it over ? &quot;
Because that had not yet been done . And then it dawned on me , and here &apos;s part of what I &apos;m saying .
I had an infrastructure . I had this deep layer , where it was like , oh my gosh , it &apos;s just your foot .
It &apos;s just the way you throw your board over .
Just let the ledge do that , and it &apos;s easy , and the next thing you know , there &apos;s 20 more tricks based out of the variations .
So that &apos;s the kind of thing that , here , check this out , here &apos;s another way , and I won &apos;t overdo this .
A little indulgent , I understand .
There &apos;s something called a primo slide .
It is the funnest trick ever to do .
It &apos;s like skinboarding .
And this one , look how it slides sideways , every which way ?
Okay , so when you &apos;re skating , and you take a fall , the board slips that way or that way . It &apos;s kind of predictable .
This ? It goes every which way . It &apos;s like a cartoon , the falls , and that &apos;s what I love the most about it .
It &apos;s so much fun to do . In fact , when I started doing them , I remember , because I got hurt . I had to get a knee surgery , right ? So there were a couple of days where , actually a couple of weeks , where I couldn &apos;t skate at all .
It would give out on me . And I would watch the guys , I &apos;d go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating , my friends , and I was like , &quot; Man I gotta do something new . I want to do something new .
I want to start fresh . I want to start fresh . &quot;
And so the night before my surgery , I &apos;d watched , and I was like , &quot; How am I going to do this ? &quot;
So I ran up , and I jumped on my board , and I cavemanned , and I flipped it down , and I remember thinking , I landed so light-footed , thinking , if my knee gives , they &apos;ll just have more work to do in the morning .
And so , when it was the crazy thing .
I don &apos;t know how many of you guys have had surgery , but -- -- you are so helpless , right ?
You &apos;re on this gurney and you &apos;re watching the ceiling go by , every time it &apos;s always that , and right when they &apos;re putting the mask on you before you go to sleep , all I was thinking is , &quot; Man , when I wake up and I get better , the first thing I &apos;m going to do is film that trick . &quot;
And indeed I did . It was the very first thing I filmed , which was awesome .
Now , let me -- I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks . Consider that content , in a sense .
What we do as street skaters is , you have these tricks . Say I &apos;m working on darkslides , or a primo , that you guys know this stuff now .
What you do is you cruise around the same streets that you &apos;ve seen a hundred times , but suddenly , because you already have something in this fixed domain of this target , it &apos;s like , what will match this trick ?
How can I expand , how can the context , how can the environment change the very nature of what I do ?
So you drive and drive and drive , and , actually I gotta admit , just because I was struggling with this because I &apos;m here , but I &apos;ll just say it , is , I cannot tell you , not only to be here in front of you , but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus , because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times .
So let me give you another example of how context shapes content .
This is a place not that far from here .
It &apos;s a rotten neighborhood . Your first consideration is , am I gonna get beat up ? You go out and -- See this wall ?
It &apos;s fairly mellow , and it &apos;s beckoning to do bank tricks , right ?
But there &apos;s this other aspect of it for wheelies , so check this out . There &apos;s a few tricks , again , how environment changes the nature of your tricks .
Freestyle oriented , manual down -- wheelie down .
Watch , this one ? Oh , I love this . It &apos;s like surfing , this one , the way you catch it .
This one , a little sketchy going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
Oop . Mental note right there . Again , we &apos;ll get back to that .
Here . Back foot , back foot . Okay , up there ?
That was called a 360 flip . Notice how the board flipped and spun this way , both axes .
And another example of how the context changed , and the creative process for me and for most skaters , is , you go , you get out of the car , you check for security , you check for stuff .
It &apos;s funny , you get to know their rhythms , you know , the guys that cruise around , and skateboarding is such a humbling thing , man .
No matter how good you are , right , you still gotta deal with ‚Äî So you hit this wall , and when I hit it , the first thing you do is you fall forward , and I &apos;m like , all right , all right .
As you adjust , you punch it up , and then when I would do that , it was throwing my shoulder this way , which as I was doing it , I was like , &quot; Oh wow , that &apos;s begging for a 360 flip , &quot; because that &apos;s how you load up for a 360 flip .
And so this is what I want to emphasize that , as you can imagine , all of these tricks are made of sub-movements , executive motor functions , more granular to the degree to which I can &apos;t quite tell you , but one thing I do know is , every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements . And so , as I &apos;m going up , these things are floating around , and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind , like , rest back , pull it back a little bit , and let your intuition go as you feel these things .
And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around , and as the wall hits you , they connect themselves &quot; Oh , 360 flip , I &apos;m going to make that . &quot;
So that &apos;s how that works to me , the creative process , the process itself of street skating .
So , next ‚Äî Oh , mind you . Those are the community .
These are some of the best skaters in the world .
These are my friends . Oh my gosh , they &apos;re such good people .
And the beauty of skateboarding is that , no one guy is the best . In fact , I know this is rotten to say , they &apos;re my friends , but a couple of them actually don &apos;t look that comfortable on their board .
What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves .
Every single one of these guys , you look at them , you can see a silhouette of them , and you realize , like , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s him , that &apos;s Haslam , that &apos;s Koston , there &apos;s these guys , these are the guys .
And skaters , I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging , but belonging on their own terms , and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do , these basic tricks , 360 flips , we take that , we make it our own , and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself .
The greater the contribution , the more we express and form our individuality , which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with .
The summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual .
I should say this . There &apos;s some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality , which we are expressing by what we do .
Next . These guys . Very similar community that &apos;s extremely conducive to innovation .
Notice a couple of these shots from the Police Department .
But it is quite similar . I mean , what is it to hack , right ?
It &apos;s knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do , right ?
And they &apos;re not all bad .
You can be a Linux kernel hacker , make it more stable , right ?
More safe , more secure . You can be an iOS hacker , make your iPhone do stuff it wasn &apos;t supposed to .
Not authorized , but not illegal .
And then you &apos;ve got some of these guys , right ?
What they do is very similar to our creative process .
They connect disparate information , and they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn &apos;t expect . Right ?
It doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic ethos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
Very similar communities , very similar .
We have our edgier sides , too . It &apos;s funny , my dad was right .
These are my peers .
But I respect what they do , and they respect what I do , because they can do things . It &apos;s amazing what they can do .
In fact , one of them , he was Ernst &amp; amp ; Young &apos;s Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County , so they &apos;re not , you never know who you &apos;re dealing with .
We &apos;ve all had some degree of fame .
In fact , I &apos;ve had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of .
I &apos;ve had a patent , and that was cool , and we started a company , and it grew , and it became the biggest , and then it went down , and then it became the biggest again , which is harder than the first time , and then we sold it , and then we sold it again .
So I &apos;ve had some success . And in the end , when you &apos;ve had all of these things , what is it that continues to drive you ? As I mentioned , the knee stuff and these things , what is it that will punch you ?
Because it &apos;s not just the mind .
What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level , and when you &apos;ve had it all , sometimes , guys , they die on the vine with all of that talent , and one of the things we &apos;ve had , all of us , is fame , I think the best kind of fame , because you can take it off .
I &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s disorienting .
And you get in a car , and you drive away , and 10-minute drive , and you get out , and no one gives a rat &apos;s who you are .
And it gives you that clarity of perspective of , man , I &apos;m just me , and popularity , what does that really mean again ? Not much .
It &apos;s peer respect that drives us . That &apos;s the one thing that makes us do what we do . I &apos;ve had over a dozen bones , these guys , this guy , over , what , eight , 10 concussions , to the point where it &apos;s comedy , right ?
It is actually comedy . They mess with him .
Next . And this is something deeper , and this is where I &apos;m ‚Äî I think I was on tour when I , I was reading one of the Feynman biographies . It was the red one or the blue one .
And he made this statement that was so profound to me .
It was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because I had won 35 out of 36 contests that I &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
In fact , winning isn &apos;t the word . I won it once .
The rest of the time , you &apos;re just defending , and you get into this , like , turtle posture , you know ?
Where you &apos;re not doing . It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun , and when it died out from under me , that was one of the most liberating things because I could create .
And look , I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy , right here . I &apos;m not here to do that .
It &apos;s just that I &apos;m in front of a very privileged audience .
If you guys aren &apos;t already leaders in your community , you probably will be , and if there &apos;s anything I can give you that will transcend what I &apos;ve gotten from skateboarding , the only things of meaning , I think , and of permanence , it &apos;s not fame , it &apos;s not all these things . What it is is that there &apos;s an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it , and better than that , because , man , I &apos;m 46 years old , or I &apos;ll be 46 , and how pathetic is that I &apos;m still skateboarding , but there is ‚Äî -- there is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making , and seeing it dispersed , and seeing younger , more talented , just different talent , take it to levels you can never imagine , because that lives on . So thank you for your time .
Krisztina Holly : I have a question for you .
So you &apos;ve really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street , and , I think it was about four years ago you officially retired . Is that it ? What &apos;s next ?
Rodney Mullen : That &apos;s a good question .
KH : Something tells me it &apos;s not the end .
RM : Yeah . I , every time you think you &apos;ve chased something down , it &apos;s funny , no matter how good you are , and I know guys like this , it feels like you &apos;re polishing a turd .
You know ?
And I thought , the only way I can extend this is to change something infrastructural , and so that &apos;s what I proceeded to do , through a long story , one of desperation , so if I do it , rather than talk about it , if I do it , you &apos;ll be the first to know . KH : All right , we won &apos;t ask you any more .
RM : You &apos;ll get a text .
KH : Right . Thank you . Good job . RM : Thank you . Thank you .
I &apos;m a historian .
Steve told us about the future of little technology ; I &apos;m going to show you some of the past of big technology .
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship and go to Saturn and Jupiter .
This took place in my childhood -- 1957 to &apos; 65 .
It was deeply classified .
I &apos;m going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified , but has now been reclassified .
If all goes well , next year I &apos;ll be back and I &apos;ll have a lot more to show you , and if all doesn &apos;t go well , I &apos;ll be in jail like Wen Ho Lee .
So , this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel , a little taller and a little bigger .
And one of the people who worked on it in the beginning was my father , Freeman , there in the middle .
That &apos;s me and my sister , Esther , who &apos;s a frequent TEDster .
I didn &apos;t like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships .
I mean , I thought it was a great idea , but I started building kayaks .
So we had a few kayaks .
Just so you know , I am not Dr. Strangelove .
But all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd , beautiful parts of this planet , I always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion , and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships .
They were really going to go , they were actually going to go .
Ted Taylor , who led the project , was going to take his children .
My father was not going to take his children ; that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years .
The project began in &apos; 57 at General Atomics there .
That &apos;s right on the coast at La Jolla .
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture : that &apos;s the 130-foot diameter library , that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .
So put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that &apos;s how big the thing was going to be .
It would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs .
The people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work .
It was the first project funded by ARPA .
That &apos;s the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars to get this thing started .
&quot; Spaceship project officially begun . Job waiting for you . Dyson . &quot;
That &apos;s July &apos; 58 .
Two days later , the space traveler &apos;s manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space : &quot; trips to satellites of the outer planets . August 20 , 1958 . &quot;
These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop .
Some of the sizes of the ships , ranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons , so that was the outer extreme .
Here was version two : 2,000 bombs .
These are five kiloton yield bombs about the size of small Volkswagens ; it would take 800 to get into orbit .
Here we see a 10,000 ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons to Saturn and back ; essentially a five year trip .
Possible departure dates : October 1960 to February 1967 .
This is trajectories going to Mars ; all this was done by hand with slide rules .
The little Orion ship and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals : you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building .
NASA had no interest ; they tried to kill the project .
The people who supported it were the Air Force , which meant that it was all secret .
And that &apos;s why when you get something declassified , that &apos;s what it looks like .
Military weapon versions that were versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet .
There &apos;s another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union .
This is the real secret stuff : how to get directed energy explosions so you &apos;re sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite , but you &apos;re directing it at the ship .
And this is still a very active subject .
It &apos;s quite dangerous , but I believe it &apos;s better to have dangerous things in the open than think you &apos;re going to keep them secret .
This is what &apos;s happened at 600 microseconds .
The Air Force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this .
The guys in La Jolla said , &quot; We &apos;ve got to get started now . &quot;
They built a high-explosive propelled model .
These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn &apos;t and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years .
So , these are three-pound charges of C4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
This is Ed Day putting ... So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C4 in it .
They &apos;re building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals .
That &apos;s my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase .
So , they had a lot of fun doing this . But no children were allowed ; my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn , but he could not say anything more about it .
So all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out , and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down .
These are stills from the video .
Jeff Bezos kindly , yesterday , said he &apos;ll put this video up on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it .
So , thanks to him .
They got quite serious about the engineering of this .
The size of that mass , for us , is really large technology in a way we &apos;re never going to go back to .
If you saw the 1959 ... This is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment ; that &apos;s acceleration profile .
And pulse system yield : we &apos;re looking at 20-kiloton yield for an effect for us of 10 million Newtons .
Well , here we have a little problem , the radiation doses at the crew station : 700 rads per shot .
Fission yields during development : they were hoping to get clean bombs -- they didn &apos;t .
Eyeburn : this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up .
Personnel compartment noise : that &apos;s not too bad ; it &apos;s very low frequencies , it &apos;s basically like these subwoofers .
And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .
Finally , at the very end in 1964 , NASA steps in and says , &quot; OK , we &apos;ll support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together . &quot;
So this is what NASA did , getting an eight man version that would go to Mars .
They liked it because the guys who kind of live there would be like , &quot; It &apos;s just like living in a submarine . &quot;
This is crew compartment . It switches , so what &apos;s upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode .
The scientists were still going to go along ; they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists .
This is a 20 man version for going to Jupiter : bunks , storm cellars , exercise room .
You know , it was going to be a nice long trip .
The Air Force version : here we have a military version .
This is the kind of stuff that &apos;s not been declassified , just that people managed to sneak home and after , you know , on their deathbed basically gave me .
The sort of artist conceptions : these are basically PowerPoint presentations given to the Air Force 40 years ago .
Look at the little guys there outside the vehicle .
And one part of NASA was interested in it but the headquarters in NASA , they killed the project .
So finally at the end , we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all those paths came to a halt .
Results : none .
This project is hereby terminated .
So that &apos;s the end . All I can say in closing is , we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it .
And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says , &quot; Well , what are we going to do ? &quot;
And Orion is really one of the only , if not the only , off-the-shelf technologies that could do something .
So I &apos;m going to tell you the good news and the bad news .
The good news is that NASA has a small , secret contingency plan division that is looking at this , trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune .
Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side .
That &apos;s the good news . The bad news is , when I got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them , they went crazy because I had all this stuff that they don &apos;t have , and NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me .
So that &apos;s the state we &apos;re at : it &apos;s not very good .
The future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong .
This is in technology . This is in the area of politics , where pundits , the CIA , MI6 always get it wrong .
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
With institutions established to think about the future , the IMF , the BIS , the Financial Stability Forum , couldn &apos;t see what was coming .
Over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
Globalization is getting more complex .
And this change is getting more rapid .
The future will be more unpredictable .
Urbanization , integration , coming together , leads to a new renaissance .
It did this a thousand years ago .
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years .
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that .
Income has gone up for a majority of the world &apos;s population , despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period .
And illiteracy has gone down , from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth .
A huge opportunity , unleashing of new potential for innovation , for development .
But there is an underbelly .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
There is the Achilles &apos; heel of growing inequality -- those that are left out , those that feel angry , those that are not participating . Globalization has not been inclusive .
The second Achilles &apos; heel is complexity -- a growing fragility , a growing brittleness .
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
This is a systemic risk , systemic shock .
We &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . We &apos;ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
It will become virulent and it &apos;s something we have to build resilience against .
A lot of this is driven by what &apos;s happening in technology .
There have been huge leaps . There will be a million-fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by 2030 .
That &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
It will continue .
Our computers , our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo &apos;s are for today .
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine .
Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago .
So what will this do ?
It will create huge opportunities in technology .
Miniaturization as well .
There will be invisible capacity . Invisible capacity in our bodies , in our brains , and in the air .
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential , not least in the area of medicine .
This is a stem cell that we &apos;ve developed here in Oxford , from an embryonic stem cell .
We can develop any part of the body .
Increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin -- able to replicate parts of the body .
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
I don &apos;t think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030 , because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body .
But the question is , &quot; Who will have it ? &quot;
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .
The capacity to create , as this mouse has been genetically modified , something which goes three times faster , lasts for three times longer , we could produce , as this mouse can , to the age of our equivalent of 80 years , using about the same amount of food .
But will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? Are we headed for a new eugenics ?
Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future ?
So the big question for us is , &quot; How do we manage this technological change ? &quot;
How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology , a technology which means that not only as we grow older , that we can also grow wiser , and that we &apos;re able to support the populations of the future ?
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .
There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030 .
These will be redundant concepts . And this isn &apos;t only something of the West .
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries .
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
Forget about pensions . Think about life and where it &apos;s going to be going .
Of course , migration will become even more important .
The war on talent , the need to attract people at all skill ranges , to push us around in our wheelchairs , but also to drive our economies . Our innovation will be vital .
The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
This would imply a massive leap in migration .
So the concerns , the xenophobic concerns of today , of migration , will be turned on their head , as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future .
And then , the systemic risks .
We understand that these will become much more virulent , that what we see today is this interweaving of societies , of systems , fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems .
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people &apos;s responsibility .
The collapse in biodiversity , climate change , pandemics , financial crises : these will be the currency that we will think about .
And so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobilize ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage systemic risk .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
It &apos;s going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall .
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements , or it could be our worst .
And of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they &apos;ve been left out in one way or another .
An individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a biopathogen .
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together ?
How do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
That will be the challenge of the scholars , and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future .
The rest of our lives will be in the future . We need to prepare for it now .
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized .
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring .
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet , collectively , through collective wisdom .
We know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
I left South Africa , and 15 years later , after thinking I would never go back , I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela .
This was a miracle . We can create miracles , collectively , in our lifetime .
It is vital that we do so .
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED , that the ideas that we think about look forward , and make sure that this will be the most glorious century , and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today , as June said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years .
We &apos;re crocheting a coral reef .
And it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
It &apos;s a project that now reaches across three continents , and its roots go into the fields of mathematics , marine biology , feminine handicraft and environmental activism .
It &apos;s true .
It &apos;s also a project that in a very beautiful way , the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth , which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which , as one of our previous speakers told us , is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin .
All of this I &apos;m going to get to in the next 18 minutes , I hope .
But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like .
Just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
This is some more images of it .
That one on the right is about five feet high .
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this .
The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
On the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
My sister and I started this project in 2005 because in that year , at least in the science press , there was a lot of talk about global warming , and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs .
Corals are very delicate organisms , and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures .
It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick .
And if the bleaching doesn &apos;t go away -- if the temperatures don &apos;t go down -- reefs start to die .
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef , particularly in coral reefs all over the world .
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring , which is a little organization we started to promote , to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics .
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
To our surprise , one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum .
And they said they were having an exhibition about artists &apos; response to global warming , and they &apos;d like our coral reef to be part of it .
I laughed and said , &quot; Well we &apos;ve only just started it , you can have a little bit of it . &quot;
So in 2007 we had an exhibition , a small exhibition of this crochet reef .
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said , &quot; In late 2007 , the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming . And we &apos;ve got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
And I , naively by this stage , said , &quot; Oh , yes , sure . &quot;
Now I say &quot; naively &quot; because actually my profession is as a science writer .
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics .
I &apos;ve written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times .
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
So I said yes to this proposition .
And I went home , and I told my sister Christine .
And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A. &apos; s major art colleges , CalArts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
She thought I &apos;d gone off my head .
But she went into crochet overdrive .
And to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center &apos;s 3,000 square foot gallery .
By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs , what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef .
So we went and taught the techniques . We did workshops and lectures .
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own .
And it was exhibited alongside ours .
There were hundreds of people involved in that .
We got invited to do the whole thing in New York , and in London , and in Los Angeles .
In each of these cities , the local citizens , hundreds and hundreds of them , have made a reef .
And more and more people get involved in this , most of whom we &apos;ve never met .
So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic , ever-evolving creature , that &apos;s actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
Now some of you are sitting here thinking , &quot; What planet are these people on ?
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
Woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
Cast it in bronze . &quot;
But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure .
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals , and kelps , and sponges and nudibranchs , is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet . It happens to be a fact .
It &apos;s almost impossible to model this structure any other way , and it &apos;s almost impossible to do it on computers .
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody ?
The next few minutes is , we &apos;re all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug .
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century .
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .
In 1997 a mathematician at Cornell , Daina Taimina , made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet .
The first one she did was knitting .
But you get too many stitches on the needle . So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing .
But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure , that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model .
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se .
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?
Before hyperbolic geometry , mathematicians knew about two kinds of space : Euclidean space , and spherical space .
And they have different properties .
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
You all have a sense of what a flat space is , Euclidean space is .
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way .
And what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
So here we have a line and a point outside the line .
And Euclid said , &quot; How can I define parallel lines ?
I ask the question , how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ? &quot;
And you all know the answer . Does someone want to shout it out ?
One . Great . Okay .
That &apos;s our definition of a parallel line .
It &apos;s a definition really of Euclidean space .
But there is another possibility that you all know of : spherical space .
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball , the surface of the Earth .
I have a straight line on my spherical surface .
And I have a point outside the line . How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface ?
Now mathematicians have answered that question .
They &apos;ve understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it &apos;s called a geodesic .
And on the surface of a sphere , a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .
So it &apos;s like the equator or the lines of longitude .
So we ask the question again , &quot; How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot;
Does someone want to guess ?
Zero . Very good .
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative .
It &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? There is two answers to the question so far , Zero and one .
Two answers ? There may possibly be a third alternative .
To a mathematician if there are two answers , and the first two are zero and one , there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .
Does anyone want to guess what it is ?
Infinity . You all got it right . Exactly .
There is , there &apos;s a third alternative .
This is what it looks like .
There &apos;s a straight line , and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line .
This is the drawing .
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they &apos;re sitting there feeling bamboozled .
Thinking , how can that be ? You &apos;re cheating . The lines are curved .
But that &apos;s only because I &apos;m projecting it onto a flat surface .
Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this .
How could they see this ?
What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
It &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever encountered Euclidean space .
Then our mathematicians come along and said , &quot; There &apos;s this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . &quot;
But you don &apos;t know what a sphere looks like .
And someone that comes along and says , &quot; Look here &apos;s a ball . &quot;
And you go , &quot; Ah ! I can see it . I can feel it .
I can touch it . I can play with it . &quot;
And that &apos;s exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in 1997 , showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space .
Here is this diagram in crochetness .
I &apos;ve stitched Euclid &apos;s parallel postulate on to the surface .
And the lines look curved .
But look , I can prove to you that they &apos;re straight because I can take any one of these lines , and I can fold along it .
And it &apos;s a straight line .
So here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces .
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry .
And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe .
So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft , Euclid and general relativity .
Now , I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible .
Here &apos;s two creatures who &apos;ve never heard of Euclid &apos;s parallel postulate -- didn &apos;t know it was impossible to violate , and they &apos;re simply getting on with it .
They &apos;ve been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age .
Their answer was interesting .
They said , &quot; Well I guess there aren &apos;t that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs . &quot;
And that &apos;s true . But it also goes deeper than that .
It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t represent .
Even mathematicians , who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers , literally couldn &apos;t see not only the sea slugs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those curly vegetables , they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry .
And so in some sense they literally , they had such a symbolic view of mathematics , they couldn &apos;t actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them .
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders .
And so , too , we &apos;ve discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .
We started out , Chrissy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
And all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own embellishments .
As it were , we have this ever-evolving , crochet taxonomic tree of life .
Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending , little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes , or orchids -- so too , do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life .
So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it .
And their individual visions , and their engagement with this mathematical mode .
We have these technologies . We use them .
But why ? What &apos;s at stake here ? What does it matter ?
For Chrissy and I , one of the things that &apos;s important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge .
We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations , equations , codes .
We live in a society that &apos;s obsessed with presenting information in this way , teaching information in this way .
But through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics , which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space .
But you can do it through playing with material objects .
One of the ways that we &apos;ve come to think about this is that what we &apos;re trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this , we &apos;re trying to have kindergarten for grown-ups .
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education , established by a man named Friedrich Froebel , who was a crystallographer in the 19th century .
He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
The value of education is something that Froebel championed , through plastic modes of play .
We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks , where great minds go to think about the world .
They write these great symbolic treatises called books , and papers , and op-ed articles .
We want to propose , Chrissy and I , through The Institute for Figuring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
And the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
But what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . -- all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d like to start with a short story .
It &apos;s about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp .
They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis , and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls , but at the same time they excited him .
And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work .
Let &apos;s fast-forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later , where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system .
Let me show you how it works .
Female Voice : Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that &apos;s a laser beam of light .
The system measures the beam &apos;s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
With two mirrors , the scanner calculates the beam &apos;s horizontal and vertical angles , giving accurate x , y , and z coordinates .
The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization program .
All of this happens in seconds .
Ben Kacyra : You can see here , these systems are extremely fast .
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .
A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day .
These babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second .
So , as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry .
Approximately ten years ago , my wife and I started a foundation to do good , and right about that time , the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas , hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan , were blown up by the Taliban .
They were gone in an instant .
And unfortunately , there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas .
This clearly devastated me , and I couldn &apos;t help but wonder about the fate of my old friends , the winged bulls , and the fate of the many , many heritage sites all over the world .
Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites .
We called the project CyArk , which stands for Cyber Archive .
To date , with the help of a global network of partners , we &apos;ve completed close to fifty projects .
Let me show you some of them : Chichen Itza , Rapa Nui -- and what you &apos;re seeing here are the cloud of points -- Babylon , Rosslyn Chapel , Pompeii , and our latest project , Mt . Rushmore , which happened to be one of our most challenging projects .
As you see here , we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal .
The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers .
We also produce media for dissemination to the public -- free through the CyArk website .
These would be used for education , cultural tourism , etc .
What you &apos;re looking at in here is a 3D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of &#91; the &#93; cloud of points in real time , cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions .
This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal .
In here you see a traditional 2D architectural engineering drawing that &apos;s used for preservation , and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs .
And here , this is a fly-through the cloud of points of Tikal , and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take of the site .
And so this is not a video .
This is actual 3D points with two to three millimeter accuracy .
And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed .
And here you &apos;re looking at a model that &apos;s extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle .
It &apos;s used for studies , for visualization , as well as for education .
And finally , we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools .
The more I got involved in the heritage field , the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them .
Of course , earthquakes and all the natural phenomena -- floods , tornadoes , etc . -- take their toll .
However , what occurred to me was human-caused destruction , which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction , but actually it was accelerating .
This includes arson , urban sprawl , acid rain , not to mention terrorism and wars .
It was getting more and more apparent that we &apos;re fighting a losing battle .
We &apos;re losing our sites and the stories , and basically we &apos;re losing a piece -- and a significant piece -- of our collective memory .
Imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
Luckily , in the last two or three decades , digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we &apos;ve brought to bear in the digital preservation , in our digital preservation war .
This includes , for example , the 3D laser scanning systems , ever more powerful personal computers , 3D graphics , high-definition digital photography , not to mention the Internet .
Because of this accelerated pace of destruction , it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work .
And we created a project we call the CyArk 500 Challenge -- and that is to digitally preserve 500 World Heritage Sites in five years .
We do have the technology that &apos;s scaleable , and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be accomplished .
However , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 .
In order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
Let me close with another short story .
Two years ago , we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site , a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda , the Royal Kasubi Tombs .
The work was done successfully in the field , and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the CyArk website .
Last March , we received very sad news .
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .
A few days later , we received a call : &quot; Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction ? &quot;
Our answer , of course , was yes .
Let me leave you with a final thought .
Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it &apos;s our collective treasure .
We owe it to our children , our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I &apos;m staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I &apos;ve been speaking , you have been scanned .
The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen .
This is all in 3D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points .
You can look at it from on top , from the ceiling .
You can look from different vantage points , but I &apos;m going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd , just to show the amount of detail that we can create .
So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes .
I &apos;d like to thank the wizards here .
We were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this : the Historic Scotland , and the Glasgow School of Art .
I &apos;d like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell , who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland .
David .
And Doug Pritchard , who &apos;s the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art .
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
Thank you .
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
I &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that I &apos;m giving for the very first time , so -- well it &apos;s -- I don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar , I &apos;m actually trying to lower the bar .
Because I &apos;ve cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session .
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said , &quot; You must become the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone , except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior . But the word &quot; behavior &quot; is also , I think , sometimes misunderstood in this context .
I &apos;m a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids , and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff .
But , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws .
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives , we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part . In order to be optimistic about this , we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy .
In order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis .
And we have one .
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time .
I was reminded of that recently , by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at , just staring at me as she walked past . She was in her 70s , looked like she had a kind face . I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction , also just staring at me . And so I said , &quot; How do you do ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; You know , if you dyed your hair black , you would look just like Al Gore . &quot;
Many years ago , when I was a young congressman , I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race .
And the military historians taught me , during that quest , that military conflicts are typically put into three categories : local battles , regional or theater wars , and the rare but all-important global , world war -- strategic conflicts .
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources , a different approach , a different organizational model .
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . But there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast , and from Western Europe to the Arctic , and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico .
And there are lots of those . But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global , or strategic , conflict .
Everything is affected . And we have to organize our response appropriately . We need a worldwide , global mobilization for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy .
We have work to do . And we can mobilize resources and political will . But the political will has to be mobilized , in order to mobilize the resources .
Let me show you these slides here .
I thought I would start with the logo . What &apos;s missing here , of course , is the North Polar ice cap .
Greenland remains . Twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox .
This last fall , I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado , and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
Here &apos;s what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers .
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn &apos;t look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States , minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona .
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi .
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . It comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice -- vulnerable . The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
Already , around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska . This is a town in Newfoundland . Antarctica . Latest studies from NASA .
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California .
&quot; They were the best of times , they were the worst of times &quot; : the most famous opening sentence in English literature . I want to share briefly a tale of two planets . Earth and Venus are exactly the same size . Earth &apos;s diameter is about 400 kilometers larger , but essentially the same size .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
But the difference is , on Earth , most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere , deposited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . On Venus , most of it is in the atmosphere . The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average . On Venus , it &apos;s 855 . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
It &apos;s three times hotter than Mercury , which is right next to the Sun . Now , briefly , here &apos;s an image you &apos;ve seen , as one of the only old images , but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI : Climate .
The global scientific community says : man-made global warming pollution , put into the atmosphere , thickening this , is trapping more of the outgoing infrared .
You all know that . At the last IPCC summary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; How certain are you ? &quot; They wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
The Chinese objected , and so the compromise was &quot; more than 90 percent . &quot;
Now , the skeptics say , &quot; Oh , wait a minute , this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun . &quot; If that were true , the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere , if it &apos;s more coming in .
If it &apos;s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . Here is the lower atmosphere .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
Now , here &apos;s the good news . Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming . Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way . There has been progress , but here is the key : when given a list of challenges to confront , global warming is still listed at near the bottom .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
If you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
Well , the Alliance for Climate Protection , which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this .
This is the winner .
NBC -- I &apos;ll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates : two of them were about the climate crisis . ABC : 844 questions , two about the climate crisis .
Fox : two . CNN : two . C zero .
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . And us .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace . And actually , their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965 . And they &apos;re catching up very dramatically . The total concentrations : by 2025 , they will be essentially where we were in 1985 .
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis .
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years .
This is peak fishing in a few seconds . The &apos; 60s .
&apos; 70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . We have to stop this . And the good news is that we can .
We have the technologies .
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
People say , &quot; What &apos;s the solution ? &quot; Here it is .
Put a price on carbon . We need a CO2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed In the poor world , we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis .
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted , if we do not solve the climate crisis .
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .
This was from Nature magazine . These are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called &quot; supergrid &quot; to supply all of the electrical power to Europe , largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents .
This is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
We need to do it for our own economy .
The latest figures show that the old model is not working . There are a lot of great investments that you can make . If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil , then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets .
And it is based on an old model .
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense .
I have a stake in these , so I &apos;ll have a disclaimer there .
But geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
You &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change .
The only two countries that didn &apos;t ratify -- and now there &apos;s only one . Australia had an election .
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there .
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia .
Lot of other things contributed to it , but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia &apos;s position on Kyoto , and he has . Now , they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .
This is Lake Lanier . My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names , we &apos;d call the one in the southeast now Katrina , and we would say it &apos;s headed toward Atlanta .
We can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture .
Here &apos;s more good news . The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there , just to localize this -- which is good news .
Now , to close , we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine .
What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill &#91; Bolte &#93; Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
And we have to find a way to create , in the generation of those alive today , a sense of generational mission .
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
Another that ended slavery . And that gave women the right to vote .
We can do this . Don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
If we had just one week &apos;s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War , we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .
We have the capacity to do it .
One final point : I &apos;m optimistic , because I believe we have the capacity , at moments of great challenge , to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us .
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying , &quot; Oh , this is so terrible .
What a burden we have . &quot; I would like to ask you to reframe that . How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ?
A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
For so many people at TED , there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn &apos;t being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true .
That hurts .
You have no idea .
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean , there &apos;s -- are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
AG : The answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain , and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . All three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label , &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; Has anybody noticed that ?
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; Clean Coal . &quot;
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
So they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the United States Senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to ratify that treaty . Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say .
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
And now we mechanized that process . Changing that pattern requires a scope , a scale , a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past .
So that &apos;s why I began by saying , be optimistic in what you do , but be an active citizen .
Demand -- change the light bulbs , but change the laws . Change the global treaties .
We have to speak up . We have to solve this democracy -- this -- We have sclerosis in our democracy . And we have to change that .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn &apos;t have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren &apos;t able to capture and store CO2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources .
Now , nobody is talking on that scale . But I do believe that between now and November , it is possible .
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization , television ads , Internet ads , radio , newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen .
We need help . We need help .
In terms of your own personal role going forward , Al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?
AG : I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question . What can I do ?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote , &quot; If the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would I do ?
How would I be ? &quot; It does depend on all of us , but again , not just with the light bulbs .
We , most of us here , are Americans . We have a democracy .
We can change things , but we have to actively change .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
And that &apos;s hard to -- that &apos;s hard to create -- but it is coming .
There &apos;s an old African proverb that some of you know that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; We have to go far , quickly .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
It &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
It &apos;s a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN .
I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider .
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider ?
Where is the Small Hadron Collider ?
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing .
Now , the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard , overlooked and neglected .
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started , and it didn &apos;t work , and people tried to work out why , it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous .
The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking .
The lesson of Brian &apos;s presentation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that vantage point determines everything that you see .
What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so valuable .
So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see .
The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get .
And so if you ask this question : Where would you look to see the future of education ?
The answer that we &apos;ve traditionally given to that is very straightforward , at least in the last 20 years : You go to Finland .
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems .
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there &apos;s a very high suicide rate , but by golly , they are qualified .
And they have absolutely amazing education systems .
So we all troop off to Finland , and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it , and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back .
Well , so , for this last year , with the help of Cisco who sponsored me , for some balmy reason , to do this , I &apos;ve been looking somewhere else .
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best , but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet , latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional , high-cost solutions , which depend on professionals , which is what schools and hospitals are .
So I ended up in places like this .
This is a place called Monkey Hill .
It &apos;s one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio .
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
We &apos;ll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world .
Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill .
This is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
So if you want recipes to work -- for virtually anything -- health , education , government politics and education -- you have to go to these places .
And if you go to these places , you meet people like this .
This is a guy called Juanderson .
At the age of 14 , in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system , he dropped out of school .
It was boring .
And Juanderson , instead , went into in the place that he lived , which was the drugs trade .
And by the age of 16 , with rapid promotion , he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas .
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week .
He employed 200 people .
He was going to be dead by the age of 25 .
And luckily , he met this guy , who is Rodrigo Baggio , the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil .
1994 , Rodrigo started something called CDI , which took computers donated by corporations , put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this .
What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible .
Or you can go to places like this .
This is Kibera , which is the largest slum in East Africa .
Millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
And there I met these two , Azra on the left , Maureen on the right .
They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education .
That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system borrows almost everything from Britain , circa 1950 , but has managed to make it even worse .
So there are schools in slums like this .
They &apos;re places like this .
That &apos;s where Maureen went to school .
They &apos;re private schools . There are no state schools in slums .
And the education they got was pitiful .
It was in places like this . This a school set up by some nuns in another slum called Nakuru .
Half the children in this classroom have no parents because they &apos;ve died through AIDS .
The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS .
So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain .
They are to stay alive , to earn a living , to not become HIV positive .
The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology .
It &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
It &apos;s the mobile phone .
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa , you would start now with the mobile phone .
Or you could go to places like this .
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside New Delhi , where I met these characters who showed me around for the day .
The remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married .
Ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
Now they &apos;re not married , and they want to go on to study further , to have a career .
They &apos;ve been brought up by mothers who are illiterate , who have never ever done homework .
All across the developing world there are millions of parents -- tens , hundreds of millions -- who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams .
And the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this .
This is a private school .
This is a fee-pay school . This is a good school .
This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education .
The reason they went on studying was this .
This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments , showing that children , in the right conditions , can learn on their own with the help of computers .
Those girls have never touched Google .
They know nothing about Wikipedia .
Imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them .
So if you look , as I did , through this tour , and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions , look at the recipes that they come up with for learning , they look nothing like school .
What do they look like ?
Well , education is a global religion .
And education , plus technology , is a great source of hope .
You can go to places like this .
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo .
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
Many of them don &apos;t have electricity at home .
But they find it completely obvious to use computers , websites , make videos , so on and so forth .
When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull , not push .
Most of our education system is push .
I was literally pushed to school .
When you get to school , things are pushed at you : knowledge , exams , systems , timetables .
If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could , for instance , buy guns , wear jewelry , ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade , and you want to attract him into education , having a compulsory curriculum doesn &apos;t really make sense .
That isn &apos;t really going to attract him .
You need to pull him .
And so education needs to work by pull , not push .
And so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this .
You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings .
What does that ?
Well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspects to it .
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation , that education has a payoff .
Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff , but you have to wait quite a long time .
That &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got siblings to look after or a business to help with .
So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then , often .
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting .
So time and again , I found people like this .
This is an amazing guy , Sebastiao Rocha , in Belo Horizonte , in the third largest city in Brazil .
He &apos;s invented more than 200 games to teach virtually any subject under the sun .
In the schools and communities that Taio works in , the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question .
Imagine an education system that started from questions , not from knowledge to be imparted , or started from a game , not from a lesson , or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them .
Our education systems , you do all that stuff afterward , if you &apos;re lucky , sport , drama , music .
These things , they teach through .
They attract people to learning because it &apos;s really a dance project or a circus project or , the best example of all -- El Sistema in Venezuela -- it &apos;s a music project .
And so you attract people through that into learning , not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you &apos;ve eaten your cognitive greens .
So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning .
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .
And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways .
Masses of peer learning .
How do you get learning to people when there are no teachers , when teachers won &apos;t come , when you can &apos;t afford them , and even if you do get teachers , what they teach isn &apos;t relevant to the communities that they serve ?
Well , you create your own teachers .
You create peer-to-peer learning , or you create para-teachers , or you bring in specialist skills .
But you find ways to get learning that &apos;s relevant to people through technology , people and places that are different .
So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune , the fastest growing city in Asia .
Pune has 5,000 building sites .
It has 30,000 children on those building sites .
That &apos;s one city .
Imagine that urban explosion that &apos;s going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites .
Well , this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus .
And they all treat learning , not as some sort of academic , analytical activity , but as that &apos;s something that &apos;s productive , something you make , something that you can do , perhaps earn a living from .
So I met this character , Steven .
He &apos;d spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of AIDS .
And he was finally brought back into school , not by the offer of GCSEs , but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter , a practical making skill .
So the trendiest schools in the world , High Tech High and others , they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity .
Here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense .
And finally , they have a different model of scale , and it &apos;s a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale .
And I learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
He &apos;s probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world .
His name is Madhav Chavan , and he created something called Pratham .
And Pratham runs preschool play groups for , now , 21 million children in India .
It &apos;s the largest NGO in education in the world .
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools .
He &apos;s a complete revolutionary .
He &apos;s actually a trade union organizer by background , and that &apos;s how he learned the skills to build his organization .
When they got to a certain stage , Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey .
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said , &quot; You know what you should do with this , Madhav ?
You should turn it into McDonald &apos;s .
And what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise .
And it &apos;s the same wherever you go .
It &apos;s reliable and people know exactly where they are .
And there will be no mistakes . &quot;
And Madhav said , &quot; Why do we have to do it that way ?
Why can &apos;t we do it more like the Chinese restaurants ? &quot;
There are Chinese restaurants everywhere , but there is no Chinese restaurant chain .
Yet , everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant .
They know what to expect , even though it &apos;ll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different .
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it .
These people work with the Chinese restaurant model -- same principles , different applications and different settings -- not the McDonald &apos;s model .
The McDonald &apos;s model scales .
The Chinese restaurant model spreads .
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century .
And that &apos;s desperately what we need again on a global scale .
And what can we learn from all of that ?
Well , we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways .
They fail to reach the people they most need to serve .
They often hit their target but miss the point .
Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize ; our faith in these systems , incredibly fraught .
And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
There are two basic types of innovation .
There &apos;s sustaining innovation , which will sustain an existing institution or an organization , and disruptive innovation that will break it apart , create some different way of doing it .
There are formal settings -- schools , colleges , hospitals -- in which innovation can take place , and informal settings -- communities , families , social networks .
Almost all our effort goes in this box , sustaining innovation in formal settings , getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the 19th century .
And as I said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren &apos;t teachers to make this model work .
You &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in China , India , Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
And in our system , we know that simply doing more of this won &apos;t eat into deep educational inequalities , especially in inner cities and former industrial areas .
So that &apos;s why we need three more kinds of innovation .
We need more reinvention .
And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves .
They &apos;re recognizably schools , but they look different .
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia .
There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden .
Of 14 of them , only two of them are in schools .
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan .
And they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum .
So we certainly need more of that .
But because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
You need efforts to supplement schools .
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy , the family-based learning system to support and encourage people in schools .
The most exciting is the Harlem Children &apos;s Zone , which over 10 years , led by Geoffrey Canada , has , through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects , attempted to transform not just education in schools , but the entire culture and aspiration of about 10,000 families in Harlem .
We need more of that completely new and radical thinking .
You can go to places an hour away , less , from this room , just down the road , which need that , which need radicalism of a kind that we haven &apos;t imagined .
And finally , you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways .
So we are on the verge , 2015 , of an amazing achievement , the schoolification of the world .
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school will be able to have one in 2015 .
It &apos;s an amazing thing .
But it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and orderly , actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century , from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers , and often by religious missionaries , taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion , and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed .
It &apos;s recognizably 19th century in its roots .
And of course it &apos;s a huge achievement .
And of course it will bring great things .
It will bring skills and learning and reading .
But it will also lay waste to imagination .
It will lay waste to appetite . It will lay waste to social confidence .
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform .
That is why we need really radical thinking , and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn .
Thank you .
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau , who said , &quot; People protect what they love , &quot; I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean , and that &apos;s the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light .
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp ; that &apos;s not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect .
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet .
Right after I completed my Ph.D. , I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration .
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme , and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel .
It was an evening dive .
I went down to a depth of 880 feet and turned out the lights .
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence .
But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was .
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room , pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight ; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke ; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire , but these were icy , blue embers .
It was breathtaking .
Now , usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all , it &apos;s these guys ; it &apos;s fireflies .
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects , earthworms , fungi -- but in general , on land , it &apos;s really rare .
In the ocean , it &apos;s the rule rather than the exception .
If I go out in the open ocean environment , virtually anywhere in the world , and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface , most of the animals -- in fact , in many places , 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light .
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows .
Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible .
I first developed this technique working from a little single-person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link , which you see here .
So , mounted in front of the observation sphere , there &apos;s a a three-foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it .
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that &apos;s about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye , albeit a little fuzzy .
So you turn on the camera , turn out the lights .
That sparkle you &apos;re seeing is not luminescence , that &apos;s just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras .
You don &apos;t see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water , but as it does , animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce .
Now , when I was first doing this , all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources .
I knew my forward speed , I knew the area , and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced .
And so , here , in the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet , I can name pretty much everything you &apos;re seeing there to the species level .
Like those big explosions , sparks , are from a little comb jelly , and there &apos;s krill and other kinds of crustaceans , and jellyfish .
There was another one of those comb jellies .
And so I &apos;ve worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point .
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land , and do nearest neighbor distances .
But you don &apos;t always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this .
You can actually see it in surface waters .
This is some shot , by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution , of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton .
And this isn &apos;t someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico , this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor .
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that , because the heads on ships -- that &apos;s toilets , for any land lovers that are listening -- are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it .
So , if you stagger into the head late at night and you &apos;re so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light , you may think that you &apos;re having a religious experience .
So , how does a living creature make light ?
Well , that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois , asked about this bioluminescent clam .
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals ; one , the enzyme , he called luciferase ; the substrate , he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer .
That terminology has stuck , but it doesn &apos;t actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms .
In fact , most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry , because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life on Mars , detecting pollutants in our waters -- which is how we use it at ORCA .
In 2008 , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish , and it &apos;s been equated to the invention of the microscope , in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering .
Another thing all these molecules are telling us that , apparently , bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history , which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival .
So , what is it about bioluminescence that &apos;s so important to so many animals ?
Well , for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness , light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive : and that &apos;s find food , attract a mate and avoid being eaten .
So , for example , this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate .
And then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini .
This fish actually has high beams .
And this fish , which is one of my favorites , has three headlights on each side of its head .
Now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication .
So , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
And I have no idea why there &apos;s two , and that &apos;s something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light , but it can see red light .
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper &apos;s scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .
It &apos;s also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off .
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure .
This is another one of my favorite fish .
This is a viperfish , and it &apos;s got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name .
The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish , it would actually impale its own brain .
So instead , it slides in grooves on the outside of the head .
This is a Christmas tree of a fish ; everything on this fish lights up , it &apos;s not just that lure .
It &apos;s got a built-in flashlight .
It &apos;s got these jewel-like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow , so when it &apos;s swimming around and there &apos;s a predator looking up from below , it makes itself disappear .
It &apos;s got light organs in the mouth , in a mucus layer on the back and the belly , all used for different things -- some of which we know about , some of which we don &apos;t .
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar , and I &apos;m very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people .
I do wish , with their budget , that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor , starving graduate student , who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that &apos;s been preserved in formalin .
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish .
So , she &apos;s got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .
And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey , but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists , or more likely their graduate students , have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing .
So , now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world , because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .
This little guy has no visible means of self-support .
He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there .
His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo .
He &apos;s got to find himself a babe and then he &apos;s got to latch on for life .
So this little guy has found himself this babe , and you will note that he &apos;s had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn &apos;t actually have to look at her .
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it , and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss .
His flesh fuses with her flesh , her bloodstream grows into his body , and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac .
Well , this is a deep-sea version of Women &apos;s Lib .
She always knows where he is , and she doesn &apos;t have to be monogamous , because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .
So they can use it for finding food , for attracting mates .
They use it a lot for defense , many different ways .
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud .
This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness .
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this : There &apos;s jellyfish , there &apos;s squid , there &apos;s a whole lot of different crustaceans , there &apos;s even fish that can do this .
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light .
And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for &quot; Blue Planet , &quot; for the deep portion of &quot; Blue Planet . &quot;
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .
So we captured one of these , and I brought it into the lab .
So I &apos;m holding it , and I &apos;m about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when I do , you &apos;ll see bioluminescence coming out .
But to me , what &apos;s shocking is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it &apos;s not just luciferin and luciferase .
For this fish , it &apos;s actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes .
It &apos;s energetically very costly for this fish to do this , and we have no idea why it does it -- another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved .
Now , another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm -- same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car ; the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of , hopefully , the police that will come and take the burglar away -- when an animal &apos;s caught in the clutches of a predator , its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker , thereby affording them a chance for escape .
This jellyfish , for example , has a spectacular bioluminescent display .
This is us chasing it in the submersible .
That &apos;s not luminescence , that &apos;s reflected light from the gonads .
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition , bring it into the lab on the ship .
And then to generate the display you &apos;re about to see , all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that &apos;s sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish .
And once this display gets going , I &apos;m not touching it anymore .
This is an unbelievable light show .
It &apos;s this pinwheel of light , and I &apos;ve done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as 300 feet away by a predator .
And I thought , &quot; You know , that might actually make a pretty good lure . &quot;
Because one of the things that &apos;s frustrated me as a deep-sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean .
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships .
And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology .
The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles .
I &apos;ve made hundreds of dives in submersibles .
When I &apos;m sitting in a submersible though , I know that I &apos;m not unobtrusive at all -- I &apos;ve got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone .
So , I &apos;ve wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
And so , sometime ago , I got this idea for a camera system .
It &apos;s not exactly rocket science . We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea .
And scientists have done this on land for years ; we just use a color that the animals can &apos;t see and then a camera that can see that color .
You can &apos;t use infrared in the sea .
We use far-red light , but even that &apos;s a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly .
Made an intensified camera , wanted to make this electronic jellyfish .
Thing is , in science , you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you &apos;re going to discover before they &apos;ll give you the money .
And I didn &apos;t know what I was going to discover , so I couldn &apos;t get the funding for this .
So I kluged this together , I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially , and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources .
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out , you know , for example , which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals , but they couldn &apos;t see us -- get the electronic jellyfish working .
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used , the word Ziploc is still visible .
Needless to say , when it &apos;s kluged together like this , there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working .
But there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
And , remarkably , that moment got caught on film by photographer Mark Richards , who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together .
That &apos;s me on the left , my graduate student at the time , Erika Raymond , and Lee Fry , who was the engineer on the project .
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption : &quot; Engineer satisfying two women at once . &quot;
And we were very , very happy .
So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators .
And so , the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool , which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico .
It &apos;s a magical place .
And I know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but I was ecstatic .
We &apos;re at the edge of the Brine Pool , there &apos;s a fish that &apos;s swimming towards the camera .
It &apos;s clearly undisturbed by us .
And I had my window into the deep sea .
I , for the first time , could see what animals were doing down there when we weren &apos;t down there disturbing them in some way .
Four hours into the deployment , we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time .
Eighty-six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display , we recorded this : This is a squid , over six feet long , that is so new to science , it cannot be placed in any known scientific family .
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept .
And based on this , I went back to the National Science Foundation and said , &quot; This is what we will discover . &quot;
And they gave me enough money to do it right , which has involved developing the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam -- which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year -- and now , more recently , a modular form of this system , a much more mobile form that &apos;s a lot easier to launch and recover , that I hope can be used on Sylvia &apos;s &quot; hope spots &quot; to help explore and protect these areas , and , for me , learn more about the bioluminescence in these &quot; hope spots . &quot;
So one of these take-home messages here is , there is still a lot to explore in the oceans .
And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what &apos;s in them , and she &apos;s right .
So if you ever , ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible , say yes -- a thousand times , yes -- and please turn out the lights .
I promise , you &apos;ll love it .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a great idea that &apos;s going to change the world .
It &apos;s fantastic , it &apos;s going to blow your mind .
It &apos;s my beautiful baby .
Here &apos;s the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby .
I mean , I was a beautiful baby .
Here &apos;s me and my dad a couple days after I was born .
So in the world of product design , the beautiful baby &apos;s like the concept car .
It &apos;s the knock-out .
You see it and you go , &quot; Oh , my God . I &apos;d buy that in a second ! &quot;
So why is it that this year &apos;s new cars look pretty much exactly like last year &apos;s new cars ?
What went wrong between the design studio and the factory ?
Today I don &apos;t want to talk about beautiful babies , I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design -- those sort of dorky teenage years where you &apos;re trying to figure out how the world works .
I &apos;m going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health .
So here &apos;s a problem : Four million babies around the world , mostly in developing countries , die every year before their first birthday , even before their first month of life .
It turns out half of those kids , or about 1.8 million newborns around the world , would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days , maybe the first week .
So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu , Nepal .
All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators -- something like this . So this is a donated Japanese Atom incubator that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu .
This is what we want .
Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal .
The problem is , without technicians , without spare parts , donations like this very quickly turn into junk .
So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about .
Keeping a baby warm for a week , that &apos;s not rocket science .
So we got started .
We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston .
We conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human-centered design .
Let &apos;s figure out what people want .
We killed thousands of Post-it notes .
We made dozens of prototypes to get to this .
So this is the NeoNurture Infant Incubator , and this has a lot of smarts built into it . And we felt great .
So the idea here is , unlike the concept car , we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works .
And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it .
Here &apos;s the bad news : The only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture Incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot .
So recognition is fantastic .
We want design to get out for people to see it .
It won lots of awards .
But it felt like a booby prize .
We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place , and I don &apos;t think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm .
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn &apos;t really -- I guess what I would say is , for us , for what I want to do , it &apos;s either too slow or it just doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s ineffective .
So really I want to design for outcomes .
I don &apos;t want to make beautiful stuff .
I want to make the world a better place .
So when we were designing NeoNurture , we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing -- for example , poor families , rural doctors , overloaded nurses , even repair technicians .
We thought we had all our bases covered , we &apos;d done everything right .
Well it turns out there &apos;s this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful : manufacturing , financing , distribution , regulation .
Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will &quot; choose , use and pay the dues &quot; for a product like this .
And I have to ask the question -- VC &apos;s always ask , &quot; Sir , what is your business , and who is your customer ? &quot;
Who is our customer ? Well here &apos;s an example .
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility .
It turns out he doesn &apos;t buy any of his equipment .
Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up .
Similarly , here &apos;s a multinational medical device manufacturer .
It turns out they &apos;ve got to fish where the fish are .
So it turns out that in emerging markets , where the fish are , are the emerging middle class of these countries -- diseases of affluence : heart disease , infertility .
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
Okay , that was an important lesson .
Second , we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project .
So we started by finding a manufacturer , an organization called MTTS in Vietnam , that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia .
Our other partner is East Meets West .
This is an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
So we started with them saying , &quot; Well what do you want ?
What &apos;s a problem you want to solve ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Well let &apos;s work on newborn jaundice . &quot;
So this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems .
So jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world .
Of those newborns , one in 10 roughly , if it &apos;s not treated , the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life-long disability , or the kids could even die .
There &apos;s one way to treat jaundice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange transfusion .
So as you can imagine , that &apos;s expensive and a little bit dangerous .
There is another cure .
It &apos;s very technological , it &apos;s very complex , a little daunting .
You &apos;ve got to shine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover .
How is this a hard problem ?
So I went to MIT , Okay , we &apos;ll figure that out .
So here &apos;s an example . This is an overhead phototherapy device that &apos;s designed for American hospitals .
And here &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to be used .
So it &apos;s over the baby , illuminating a single patient .
Take it out of an American hospital , send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia , here &apos;s how it &apos;s actually used .
The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity .
So these dark blue squares show you where it &apos;s effective phototherapy .
Here &apos;s what it looks like under actual use .
So those kids on the edges aren &apos;t actually receiving effective phototherapy .
But without training , without some kind of light meter , how would you know ?
We see other examples of problems like this .
So here &apos;s a neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies .
And keep in mind , Mom maybe just had a C-section , so that &apos;s already kind of a bummer .
Mom &apos;s visiting her kid .
She sees her baby naked , lying under some blue lights , looking kind of vulnerable .
It &apos;s not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby .
From a phototherapy standpoint , maybe not the best behavior .
In fact that sounds kind of dumb .
Except , what we &apos;ve learned is that there &apos;s no such thing as a dumb user -- really is what we &apos;ve learned .
There are only dumb products .
We have to think like existentialists .
It &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , it &apos;s the painting that we actually painted .
It &apos;s the use -- designed for actual use .
How are people actually going to use this ?
So similarly , when we think about our partner MTTS , they &apos;ve made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses .
So here &apos;s an overhead warmer and a CPAP .
They &apos;re inexpensive , really rugged .
They &apos;ve treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology .
But here &apos;s the problem : Every doctor in the world , every hospital administrator , has seen TV -- curse those &quot; E.R. &quot; reruns .
Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like .
They want Buck Rogers , they don &apos;t want effective .
It sounds crazy , it sounds dumb , but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy .
So again , if we want people to trust a device , it has to look trustworthy .
So thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
So we took all that information together .
We tried , this time , to get it right .
And here &apos;s what we developed .
So this is the Firefly Phototherapy Device , except this time we didn &apos;t stop at the concept car .
So from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers .
Our goal is to make a state-of-the-art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture .
So our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product .
So that &apos;s the design for manufacture question .
When we think about actual use , you &apos;ll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet .
It only fits a single baby .
And the idea here is it &apos;s obvious how you ought to use this device .
If you try to put more than one kid in , you &apos;re stacking them on top of each other .
So the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong .
In other words , you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it .
Another example : Again , silly mom .
Silly mom thinks her baby looks cold , wants to put a blanket over the baby .
Well that &apos;s why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly .
So if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it &apos;s still receiving effective phototherapy from below .
Last story here : I &apos;ve got a friend in India who told me that you haven &apos;t really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia until you &apos;ve trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside .
You think it &apos;s funny .
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps , and the screen had all these dead pixels on it .
And one day I looked in , they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished -- those poor ants !
So with Firefly , what we did is -- the problem is electronics get hot and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool -- in most products .
We decided that I can &apos;t put a &quot; do not enter &quot; sign next to the vent .
We actually got rid of all of that stuff .
So Firefly &apos;s totally sealed .
These are the kinds of lessons -- as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager , much worse to be a frustrated designer .
So I was thinking about , what I really want to do is change the world .
I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution .
I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device .
I actually have to pay attention . Really , there &apos;s no excuse for failure .
I have to think like an existentialist .
I have to accept that there are no dumb users , that there &apos;s only dumb products .
We have to ask ourselves hard questions .
Are we designing for the world that we want ?
Are we designing for the world that we have ?
Are we designing for the world that &apos;s coming , whether we &apos;re ready or not ?
I got into this business designing products .
I &apos;ve since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world , you have to design outcomes .
And that &apos;s design that matters .
Thank you .
One thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates .
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
If you think about the arguments we have , most of the time it &apos;s shouting matches on cable television , ideological food fights on the floor of Congress .
I have a suggestion .
Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street , over the gap between rich and poor , over affirmative action and same-sex marriage .
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice .
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion .
First , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens , Aristotle &apos;s theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle &apos;s ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today .
So , are you ready for the lecture ?
According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve .
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s obvious enough .
The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why .
Take the example of flutes .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
Who should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people -- What would you say ?
Who should get the best flute ?
You can just call it out .
Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
Who else ?
The best flute players .
The worst flute players .
How many say the best flute players ?
Why ?
Actually , that was Aristotle &apos;s answer too .
But here &apos;s a harder question .
Why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
The greatest benefit to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
That &apos;s Peter ?
All right .
Well , it &apos;s a good reason .
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .
But Peter , Aristotle doesn &apos;t agree with you that that &apos;s the reason .
That &apos;s all right .
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
He said , that &apos;s what flutes are for -- to be played well .
He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity -- in this case , musical performance .
And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music .
It &apos;ll be a happy byproduct that we &apos;ll all benefit .
But when we think about justice , Aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing .
One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy , but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians .
Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case .
Let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
It had to do with golf .
Casey Martin -- a few years ago , Casey Martin -- did any of you hear about him ?
He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability .
He had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course .
In fact , it carried risk of injury .
He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers &apos; Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments .
They said , &quot; No .
Now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot;
He sued , and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
He says , &quot; I &apos;m a great golfer .
I want to compete .
But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next . &quot;
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?
All right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands .
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
All right , we have a good division of opinion here .
Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ?
Raise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a microphone .
What would be your reason ?
It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage .
What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart ?
How would you answer the objection ?
Yes , all right .
What &apos;s your name ?
Charlie says -- We &apos;ll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply .
Tell us , Charlie , why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ?
Charlie : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
But what about walking from hole to hole ?
Charlie : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
All right . Stay there , Charlie .
Who has an answer for Charlie ?
All right , who has an answer for Charlie ?
What would you say ?
Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes .
Walking all those holes ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ?
What &apos;s your name ?
Warren .
Charlie , what do you say to Warren ?
Charley : I &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
Warren , are you a golfer ?
Warren : I am not a golfer .
Charley : And I am .
You know , it &apos;s interesting .
In the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue .
Is walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
Yes . They agreed with Warren .
They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise .
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart .
Now , notice , something interesting -- Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first .
The Supreme Court decided .
What do you suppose they said ?
They said yes , that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart .
Seven to two , they ruled .
What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf .
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .
And Justice Stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental .
Now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was Justice Scalia .
He wouldn &apos;t have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent .
It &apos;s interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
He said it &apos;s not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game &apos;s arbitrary rules is essential . &quot;
So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority &apos;s opinion .
Justice Scalia &apos;s opinion is questionable for two reasons .
First , no real sports fan would talk that way .
If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game .
It &apos;s also objectionable on a second ground .
On the face of it , it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness , what &apos;s an unfair advantage .
But if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution .
What would it be ?
Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .
Then the fairness objection goes away .
But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , I suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA , even than making an exception for Casey Martin .
Why ?
Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , relatedly , the question : What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ?
Let me put the point as delicately as possible : Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
After all , there &apos;s no running or jumping , and the ball stands still .
So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .
That illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , &quot; What is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? &quot;
Let &apos;s take a final example that &apos;s prominent in contemporary political debate : same-sex marriage .
There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage .
How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?
And how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?
Now , put it this way : What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ?
The opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging .
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no , procreation is not the only purpose of marriage ; what about a lifelong , mutual , loving commitment ?
That &apos;s really what marriage is about .
So with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , Aristotle has a point .
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition .
So let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world .
There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion .
So better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life .
It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite , that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life , rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter .
That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thanks . Thank you .
Chris .
Thanks , Chris .
From flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -- that was a genius link .
Now look , you &apos;re a pioneer of open education .
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
Well , I think that it is possible .
In the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .
And I think we can do that in public life more generally .
And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we &apos;ve created of the course -- it &apos;s available now , online , free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions , at universities in China , in India , in Africa , around the world , to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate .
So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ?
Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students .
Wouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom .
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
So , I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor .
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much .
I want to address the issue of compassion .
Compassion has many faces .
Some of them are fierce ; some of them are wrathful ; some of them are tender ; some of them are wise .
A line that the Dalai Lama once said , he said , &quot; Love and compassion are necessities .
They are not luxuries .
Without them , humanity cannot survive . &quot;
And I would suggest , it is not only humanity that won &apos;t survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we &apos;ve heard today .
It is the big cats , and it &apos;s the plankton .
Two weeks ago , I was in Bangalore in India .
I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore .
And early in the morning , I went into the ward .
In that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragile , obviously in the latter phase of active dying .
I looked into her face .
I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata , the great Indian epic : &quot; What is the most wondrous thing in the world , Yudhisthira ? &quot;
And Yudhisthira replied , &quot; The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don &apos;t realize it can happen to us . &quot;
I looked up .
Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore .
I looked into the face of one of these women , and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person .
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for .
Every year or so , I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau .
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there &apos;s no medical care whatsoever .
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla , far west of Nepal , the most impoverished region of Nepal , an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags .
And he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes .
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
Again , the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara .
It was the young women , the health aids , who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .
I know those hands and eyes ; they touched me as well .
They touched me at that time .
They have touched me throughout my 68 years .
They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
She had phenomenal strength .
And it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
So we can ask : What is compassion comprised of ?
And there are various facets .
And there &apos;s referential and non-referential compassion .
But first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I &apos;m not separate from this suffering .
But that is not enough , because compassion , which activates the motor cortex , means that we aspire , we actually aspire to transform suffering .
And if we &apos;re so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
But compassion has another component , and that component is really essential .
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years .
I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security &#91; prison &#93; for six years .
And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
And when I worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered .
That compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
It is there within every human being .
But the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
I had that condition , to a certain extent , from my own childhood illness .
Eve Ensler , whom you &apos;ll hear later , has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through .
And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies , and those enemies are things like pity , moral outrage , fear .
And you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
And in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
The very word terror is global .
The very feeling of terror is global .
So our work , in a certain way , is to address this imago , this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities .
For example : A person who is cultivating compassion , when they are in the presence of suffering , they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do .
However , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
This is called resilience .
Many of us think that compassion drains us , but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us .
Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what &apos;s called neural integration .
It hooks up all parts of the brain .
Another , which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on , is that compassion enhances our immune system .
Hey , we live in a very noxious world .
Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons , of the toxins of our world .
But compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobilizes our immunity .
You know , if compassion is so good for us , I have a question .
Why don &apos;t we train our children in compassion ?
If compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they &apos;re supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
And if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
Why don &apos;t we vote for people in our government based on compassion , so that we can have a more caring world ?
In Buddhism , we say , &quot; it takes a strong back and a soft front . &quot;
It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions .
And that is the mental quality of equanimity .
But it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an undefended heart .
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara , Kuan-Yin .
It &apos;s a female archetype : she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
She stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liberation , and in the palm of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
I say that , for thousands of years , women have lived , exemplified , met in intimacy , the archetype of Avalokitesvara , of Kuan-Yin , she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered , unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .
They have infused societies with kindness , and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half .
And they have actualized compassion through direct action .
Jody Williams called it : It &apos;s good to meditate .
I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;ve got to do a little bit of that , Jody .
Step back , give your mother a break , okay .
But the other side of the equation is you &apos;ve got to come out of your cave .
You have to come into the world like Asanga did , who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m out of here . &quot;
He &apos;s going down the path .
He sees something in the path .
He looks , it &apos;s a dog , he drops to his knees .
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
The wound is just filled with maggots .
He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots , so as not to harm them .
And at that moment , the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness .
I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men -- with their fathers , with their sons , with their brothers , with the plumbers , the road builders , the caregivers , the doctors , the lawyers , with our president , and with all beings .
The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire .
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
Thank you .
Now when we think of our senses , we don &apos;t usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
We don &apos;t really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses , but that &apos;s probably why our senses really evolved -- to keep us safe , to allow us to live .
Really when we think of our senses , or when we think of the loss of the sense , we really think about something more like this : the ability to touch something luxurious , to taste something delicious , to smell something fragrant , to see something beautiful .
This is what we want out of our senses .
We want beauty ; we don &apos;t just want function .
And when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk to you a little bit about today .
Likewise for hearing .
When we think about why we hear , we don &apos;t often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren , although clearly that &apos;s an important thing .
Really what we want to hear is music .
So many of you know that that &apos;s Beethoven &apos;s Seventh Symphony .
Many of you know that he was deaf , or near profoundly deaf , when he wrote that .
Now I &apos;d like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music .
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
It &apos;s acoustic vibrations in the air , little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum .
Somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones , which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
That process is entirely abstract and very , very unusual .
And we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out , how is it that we hear something that &apos;s emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air ?
Turns out that if you have hearing loss , most people that lose their hearing lose it at what &apos;s called the cochlea , the inner ear .
And it &apos;s at the hair cell level that they do this .
Now if you had to pick a sense to lose , I have to be very honest with you and say , we &apos;re better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is .
In fact , nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .
And as a physician and a surgeon , I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose , we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .
As a musician , I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant , I &apos;d be heartbroken . I &apos;d just be plainly heartbroken , because I know that music would never sound the same to me .
Now this is a video that I &apos;m going to show you of a girl who &apos;s born deaf .
She &apos;s in a very supportive environment .
Her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
Okay , play that video please .
Mother : That &apos;s an owl .
Owl , yeah .
Owl . Owl .
Yeah .
Baby . Baby .
You want it ?
Charles Limb : Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning , there is a limitation to what a child who &apos;s deaf , an infant who was born deaf , has in this world in terms of social , educational , vocational opportunities .
I &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a beautiful , wonderful life .
I &apos;m saying that they &apos;re going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face .
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
I mean literally , they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss .
Back then you couldn &apos;t even look at the eardrum .
So it &apos;s not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss .
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant , which is an outpatient procedure .
It &apos;s surgically placed inside the inner ear .
It takes about an hour and a half to two hours , depending on where it &apos;s done , under general anesthesia .
And in the end , you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea .
Now actually , this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear .
But here is that same girl who is implanted now .
This is her 10 years later .
And this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor , Dr. John Niparko , who implanted her .
If we could play this video please .
John Niparko : So you &apos;ve written two books ?
Girl : I have written two books .
Girl : No , the other one was a book .
JN : Well this book has seven chapters , and the last chapter is entitled &quot; The Good Things About Being Deaf . &quot;
Do you remember writing that chapter ?
Girl : Yes I do . I remember writing every chapter .
JN : Yeah .
Girl : Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying .
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her .
JN : I see . And who is that ?
Girl : Holly .
Mother : Her sister . Girl : My sister .
JN : And how can you avoid being annoyed by her ?
Girl : I just take off my CI , and I don &apos;t hear anything .
It comes in handy .
JN : So you don &apos;t want to hear everything that &apos;s out there ?
Girl : No .
CL : And so she &apos;s phenomenal .
And there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t look at that as an overwhelming success .
It is . It &apos;s a huge success story in modern medicine .
However , despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language , you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can &apos;t hear music almost at all .
In fact , most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad .
And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody &apos;s life , we have a long way to go when it comes to audition .
Now there are a lot of reasons for that .
I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it &apos;s abstract .
Language is very different . Language is very precise .
In fact , the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .
When you say a word , what you care is that word was perceived correctly .
You don &apos;t care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken .
Music is entirely different .
When you hear music , if it doesn &apos;t sound good , what &apos;s the point ?
There &apos;s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn &apos;t sound good to you .
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
And you can see on this figure , that the frequency range and the decibel range , the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous .
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission .
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing .
If you can hear music , you should be able to hear anything .
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
I mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
And without the ability to perceive pitch well , music and melody is a very difficult thing to do -- forget about a harmony and things like that .
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff &apos;s Prelude .
Now if we could just play this .
Okay , now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves , let &apos;s see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone .
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users .
Go ahead and play this one .
Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation .
You distort it a little bit , especially in terms of pitch , and you &apos;ve changed it .
And it might be that you kind of like that .
That &apos;s kind of hypnotic .
But it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
And you &apos;re not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing .
Now the other issue comes with , not just the ability to tell pitches apart , but the ability to tell sounds apart .
Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument .
If we could play these two sound clips in succession .
The trumpet .
And the second one .
That &apos;s a violin .
These have similar wave forms . They &apos;re both sustained instruments .
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
The sound quality , or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre , tone color -- they cannot tell these things whatsoever .
This implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth .
Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech , have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody , what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech .
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech , they were designed for speech .
But actually if you look at melody , what you find is that there &apos;s very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls .
So for whatever reason , this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception .
Now the next question is , well how does it really sound ?
Now we &apos;ve been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users .
I &apos;m going to play you two clips of Usher , one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies , almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies .
Go ahead and play that .
I had patients tell me that those sound the same .
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips .
Again , we are very , very far away in just getting to where we want to get to .
Now the question comes to mind : Is there any hope ?
And yes , there is hope .
Now I don &apos;t know if anybody knows who this is .
This is ... does somebody know ?
This is Beethoven .
Now why would we know what Beethoven &apos;s skull looks like ?
Because his grave was exhumed .
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness , which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there .
But Beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing .
What that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
The brains remain hardwired for music .
I &apos;ve been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I &apos;ve been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants .
This is a cat that &apos;s been trained to respond to a trumpet for food .
Text : Beethoven doesn &apos;t excite her .
The &quot; 1812 Overture &quot; isn &apos;t worth waking for .
But she jumps to action when called to duty !
CL : Now I &apos;m not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we &apos;re hearing it .
I &apos;m suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance , even in a cat .
If we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music -- because right now there &apos;s virtually no effort put towards that , no rehabilitative strategies , very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music -- we would come a long way .
Now I want to show you one last video .
And this is of a student of mine named Joseph who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
He &apos;s deaf , and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant .
And here &apos;s a video of Joseph .
Joseph : I was born in 1986 .
And at about four months old , I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss .
Not long after , I was fitted with hearing aids .
But although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they weren &apos;t very helpful .
So as a result , I had to rely on lip reading a lot , and I couldn &apos;t really hear what people were saying .
When I was 12 years old , I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .
And not long after I got my cochlear implant , I started learning how to play piano .
And it was absolutely wonderful .
Since then , I &apos;ve never looked back .
CL : Joseph is phenomenal . He &apos;s brilliant .
He is now a medical student at Yale University , and he &apos;s contemplating a surgical career -- one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery .
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere .
And this is really unheard of stuff , and this is all because of this technology .
And the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain .
Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant , because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time .
You don &apos;t actually have to hear it .
I know he doesn &apos;t hear well , because I &apos;ve heard him do Karaoke .
And it &apos;s one of the most awful things -- heartwarming , but awful .
And so there is certainly a lot of hope , but there &apos;s a lot more that needs to be done .
So I just want to conclude with the following words .
When it comes to restoration of hearing , we have certainly come a long way , a remarkably long way .
And we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
And let me tell you right now , it &apos;s fine that we would all be very happy with speech .
But I tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
You wouldn &apos;t want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical .
And I don &apos;t mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function .
But it &apos;s really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring .
And I don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
And I want to thank you for your time .
We invent .
My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas .
And we do that for a couple of reasons .
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit .
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
So we do this fun and profit-oriented inventing for most of what we do , but we also have a program where we invent for humanity -- where we take some of our best inventors , and we say , &quot; Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has ? &quot; -- and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems , which is with dramatic , crazy , out-of-the-box solutions .
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work , so thank you .
So I &apos;m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions underway .
Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health , a fantastic thing .
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they &apos;re administered , and that &apos;s because they need to be kept cold .
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .
They go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
It &apos;s not just the loss of the vaccine that matters ; it &apos;s the fact that those kids don &apos;t get vaccinated .
This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried : These are Styrofoam chests . These are being carried by people , but they &apos;re also put on the backs of pickup trucks .
We &apos;ve got a different solution .
Now , one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it .
And we thought , well , that &apos;s not really good enough .
So we made this thing .
This lasts six months with no power ; absolutely zero power , because it loses less than a half a watt .
Now , this is our second generations prototype .
The third generation prototype is , right now , in Uganda being tested .
Now , the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas : One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar , something you &apos;d keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in .
They have incredible insulation , so let &apos;s put some incredible insulation here .
The other idea is kind of interesting , which is , you can &apos;t reach inside anymore .
Because if you open it up and reach inside , you &apos;d let the heat in , the game would be over .
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine .
It vends out little individual vials .
So a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world .
We &apos;ll move on to malaria .
Malaria is one of the great public health problems .
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this .
Two hundred million people a year .
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies ; 27 will die during my talk .
And there &apos;s no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved .
Another comment of Esther &apos;s was that we react when there &apos;s a tragedy like Haiti , but that tragedy is ongoing .
So what can we do about it ?
Well , there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria .
You can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues .
You can try to treat people and create awareness .
That &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
A vaccine would be a terrific thing , only they don &apos;t work yet .
People have tried for a long time . There are a couple of interesting candidates .
It &apos;s a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for .
You can distribute bed nets , and bed nets are very effective if you use them .
You don &apos;t always use them for that . People fish with them .
They don &apos;t always get to everyone .
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
Now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
We could spend hours going over this .
It &apos;s got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle ; they have sex , they burrow into your liver , they tunnel into your blood cells ...
it &apos;s an incredibly complicated disease , but that &apos;s actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria : There &apos;s a lot of potential ways in .
One of those ways might be better diagnosis .
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices .
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic &apos;s glucose meter works : You take a drop of blood , you put it in there and it automatically tells you .
Today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it .
The other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
And if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
Because if you actually look through your fingernails , you can see blood vessels , and once you see blood vessels , we think we can see the malaria .
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin .
It &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
Interesting , anyway , if you &apos;re a solid-state physicist .
There &apos;s a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
This is our femtosecond laser lab .
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond .
That &apos;s really , really , really short .
This is a pulse of light that &apos;s only about one wavelength of light long , so it &apos;s a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously .
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin .
So here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
And using both this technique and other optical techniques , we think we can make those diagnostics .
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria : a way , in acute cases , to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .
Sort of like doing dialysis , but for relieving the parasite load .
This is our thousand-core supercomputer .
We &apos;re kind of software guys , and so nearly any problem that you pose , we like to try to solve with some software .
One of the problems that you have if you &apos;re trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don &apos;t know what &apos;s the most effective thing to do .
Okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
You spend a certain amount per bed net .
Or you could spray .
You can give drug administration .
There &apos;s all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness .
How can you tell ?
So we &apos;ve created , using our supercomputer , the world &apos;s best computer model of malaria , which we &apos;ll show you now .
We picked Madagascar .
We have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of Madagascar .
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .
That &apos;s very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you &apos;ve got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .
So that sets the stage on which you do this .
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes , and you have to model that and how they come and go .
Ultimately , it gives you this .
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar .
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .
We &apos;re going to the dry season now .
It nearly goes away in the dry season , because there &apos;s no place for the mosquitoes to breed .
And then , of course , the next year it comes roaring back .
By doing these kinds of simulations , we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ; to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs -- how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? -- or the social trade-offs -- what happens if unrest breaks out ?
We also try to study our foe .
This is a high-speed camera view of a mosquito .
And , in a moment , we &apos;re going to see a view of the airflow .
Here , we &apos;re trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we &apos;re illuminating with a laser .
By understanding how mosquitoes fly , we hope to understand how to make them not fly .
Now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT .
This is a real ad .
This is one of those things you just can &apos;t make up .
Once upon a time , this was the primary technique , and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through DDT .
The United States did .
In 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States , but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .
So we thought , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium , the parasite involved .
What can we do to the mosquito ?
Well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
Now , that sounds silly , but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use .
Your Blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser .
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that &apos;s used to steer a laser beam very accurately ; that &apos;s what makes those little dots on the page .
And , of course , there &apos;s signal processing and digital cameras .
So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers ?
Now , in our company , this is what we call &quot; the pinky-suck moment . &quot;
What if we could do that ?
Now , just suspend disbelief for a moment , and let &apos;s think of what could happen if we could do that .
Well , we could protect very high-value targets like clinics .
Clinics are full of people that have malaria .
They &apos;re sick , and so they &apos;re less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes .
You really want to protect them .
Of course , if you do that , you could also protect your backyard .
And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100 percent organic .
They &apos;re completely natural .
Now , it actually gets better than this .
You could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .
And then you could decide : &quot; Is this an insect I want to kill , or an insect I don &apos;t want to kill ? &quot;
Moore &apos;s law made computing cheap ; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down .
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .
They &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar , from flowers -- in fact , in the lab , we feed ours raisins -- but the female needs the blood meal .
So , this sounds really crazy , right ?
Would you like to see it ?
Audience : Yeah !
Nathan Myhrvold : Okay , so our legal department prepared a disclaimer , and here it is .
Now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .
So , Eric Johanson , who built the device , actually , with parts from eBay ; and Pablos Holman over here , he &apos;s got mosquitoes in the tank .
We have the device over here .
And we &apos;re going to show you , instead of the kill laser , which will be a very brief , instantaneous pulse , we &apos;re going to have a green laser pointer that &apos;s going to stay on the mosquito for , actually , quite a long period of time ; otherwise , you can &apos;t see it very well .
Take it away Eric .
Eric Johanson : What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage .
And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around .
And Pablos , if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around .
Now , that &apos;s a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works .
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they &apos;re flying around , which is kind of fun .
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .
Now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .
NM : That &apos;s a mosquito wing beat you &apos;re hearing .
EJ : Finally , let &apos;s see what this looks like .
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around , being lit up .
This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what &apos;s happening .
Here we have it running at high-speed mode .
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world .
NM : So it wouldn &apos;t be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit &apos; em .
This is very satisfying .
This is one of the first ones we did .
The energy &apos;s a little bit high here .
We &apos;ll loop around here in just a second , and you &apos;ll see another one .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
An interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we &apos;ve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .
The wing motor is very resilient .
I mean , here we &apos;re blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .
So , that &apos;s what I have . Thanks very much .
Einstein said that &quot; I never think about the future ‚Äî it comes soon enough . &quot;
And he was right , of course .
So today , I &apos;m here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now .
Over the past 200 years , the world has experienced two major waves of innovation .
First , the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories , railways , electricity , air travel , and our lives have never been the same .
Then the Internet revolution brought us computing power , data networks , unprecedented access to information and communication , and our lives have never been the same .
Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change : the industrial Internet .
It brings together intelligent machines , advanced analytics , and the creativity of people at work .
It &apos;s the marriage of minds and machines .
And our lives will never be the same .
In my current role , I see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives : energy , aviation , transportation , health care .
For an economist , this is highly unusual , and it &apos;s extremely exciting , because this is a transformation as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more , and before the Industrial Revolution , there was no economic growth to speak of .
So what is this industrial Internet ?
Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see , hear , feel a lot more than ever before , generating prodigious amounts of data .
Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data , providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways , a lot more efficiently .
And not just individual machines , but fleets of locomotives , airplanes , entire systems like power grids , hospitals .
It is asset optimization and system optimization .
Of course , electronic sensors have been around for some time , but something has changed : a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and , thanks to advances in cloud computing , a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data .
So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent ; they are brilliant .
They are self-aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
It &apos;s jet engines , locomotives , gas turbines , medical devices , communicating seamlessly with each other and with us .
It &apos;s a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it .
We are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization , multi-core processor technology , advanced cloud-based communications , a new software-defined machine infrastructure which allows machine functionality to become virtualized in software , decoupling machine software from hardware , and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor , manage and upgrade industrial assets .
Why does any of this matter at all ?
Well first of all , it &apos;s already allowing us to shift towards preventive , condition-based maintenance , which means fixing machines just before they break , without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule .
And this , in turn , is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime , which means there will be no more power outages , no more flight delays .
So let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work , and some of the examples may seem trivial , some are clearly more profound , but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact .
Let &apos;s start with aviation .
Today , 10 percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events .
Something goes wrong unexpectedly .
This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year , not to mention the impact on all of us : stress , inconvenience , missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal .
So how can the industrial Internet help here ?
We &apos;ve developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft .
It &apos;s self-learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss .
The aircraft , while in flight , will communicate with technicians on the ground .
By the time it lands , they will already know if anything needs to be serviced .
Just in the U.S. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year , helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time .
Or take healthcare .
Today , nurses spend an average of 21 minutes per shift looking for medical equipment .
That seems trivial , but it &apos;s less time spent caring for patients .
St. Luke &apos;s Medical Center in Houston , Texas , which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients , staff and medical equipment , has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour .
If you need surgery , one hour matters .
It means more patients can be treated , more lives can be saved .
Another medical center , in Washington state , is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and MRIs to be analyzed in the cloud , developing better analytics at a lower cost .
Imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma , and needs the attention of several specialists : a neurologist , a cardiologist , an orthopedic surgeon .
If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken , they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster .
So all of this translates into better health outcomes , but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits .
Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide , and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis .
Similar advances are happening in energy , including renewable energy .
Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way , depending on how the wind is blowing , can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt / hour .
Ten years ago , that cost was 30 cents , six times as much .
The list goes on , and it will grow fast , because industrial data are now growing exponentially .
By 2020 , they will account for over 50 percent of all digital information .
But this is not just about data , so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day , because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way , making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding .
Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing .
She already has all the spare parts , because the problems were diagnosed in advanced .
And if she faces an unexpected issue , the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center , let them see what she sees , transmit data that they can run through diagnostics , and they can stream videos that will guide her , step by step , through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running .
And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database .
Let &apos;s stop and think about this for a minute , because this is a very important point .
This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work .
And I know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs .
Unemployment is already high , and there is always a fear that innovation will destroy jobs .
And innovation is disruptive .
But let me stress two things here .
First , we &apos;ve already lived through mechanization of agriculture , automation of industry , and employment has gone up , because innovation is fundamentally about growth .
It makes products more affordable .
It creates new demand , new jobs .
Second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly-specialized workers .
And believe me , as an economist , I am also scared .
But think about it : Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad , so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels .
The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of &quot; Modern Times . &quot;
And to be sure , new high-skilled jobs will be created : mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data ; managers who understand their industry and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology .
But now let &apos;s take a step back .
Let &apos;s look at the big picture .
There are people who argue that today &apos;s innovation is all about social media and silly games , with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution .
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us .
And every time I hear this , I can &apos;t help thinking that even back in the Stone Age , there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy , and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill , and saying to each other , &quot; Yeah , this wheel thing , cool toy , sure , but compared to fire , it will have no impact .
The big discoveries are all behind us . &quot;
This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen .
Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward .
They &apos;ve created jobs .
They &apos;ve raised living standards .
They &apos;ve made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
And the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different .
In the U.S. alone , the industrial Internet could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent over the next 15 years , boosting growth to rates we haven &apos;t seen in a long time , and adding between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP .
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today .
But this is not a foregone conclusion .
We are just at the beginning of this transformation , and there will be barriers to break , obstacles to overcome .
We will need to invest in the new technologies .
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices .
We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks .
And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills .
It &apos;s not going to be easy , but it is going to be worth it .
The economic challenges facing us are hard , but when I walk the factory floor , and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected , and I see the difference this makes in a hospital , in an airport , in a power generation plant , I &apos;m not just optimistic , I &apos;m enthusiastic .
This new technological revolution is upon us .
So think about the future ‚Äî it will be here soon enough .
Thank you .
How many Creationists do we have in the room ?
Probably none . I think we &apos;re all Darwinians .
And yet many Darwinians are anxious , a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes .
It &apos;s all right .
You know spiderwebs ? Sure , they are products of evolution .
The World Wide Web ? Not so sure .
Beaver dams , yes . Hoover Dam , no .
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves , fruits of the tree of life , and hence , in some sense , obeying evolutionary rules ?
And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
And so I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .
So you &apos;re out in the woods , or you &apos;re out in the pasture , and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass .
It climbs up to the top , and it falls , and it climbs , and it falls , and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass .
What is this ant doing ? What is this in aid of ?
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass ?
What &apos;s in it for the ant ?
And the answer is : nothing . There &apos;s nothing in it for the ant .
Well then , why is it doing this ?
Is it just a fluke ?
Yeah , it &apos;s just a fluke . It &apos;s a lancet fluke .
It &apos;s a little brain worm .
It &apos;s a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle .
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds , and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant , crawl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle .
So there &apos;s nothing in it for the ant .
The ant &apos;s brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain , inducing suicidal behavior .
Pretty scary .
Well , does anything like that happen with human beings ?
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness , of course .
Well , it may already have occurred to you that Islam means &quot; surrender , &quot; or &quot; submission of self-interest to the will of Allah . &quot;
Well , it &apos;s ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains .
Now , am I saying that a sizable minority of the world &apos;s population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas ?
No , it &apos;s worse than that .
Most people have .
There are a lot of ideas to die for .
Freedom , if you &apos;re from New Hampshire .
Justice . Truth . Communism .
Many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
And many for Catholicism . And many for Islam .
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
They &apos;re infectious .
Yesterday , Amory Lovins spoke about &quot; infectious repititis . &quot;
It was a term of abuse , in effect .
This is unthinking engineering .
Well , most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant , new , out-of-the-box thinking .
It &apos;s &quot; infectious repetitis , &quot; and we might as well try to have a theory of what &apos;s going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection .
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others .
I myself am a philosopher , and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is .
And you have to have a bumper sticker , you know . You have to have a statement .
So , this is mine .
The secret of happiness is : Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
Most of us -- now that the &quot; Me Decade &quot; is well in the past -- now we actually do this .
One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives .
This is what our summum bonum is .
It &apos;s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
Now , this is a profound biological effect .
It &apos;s the subordination of genetic interest to other interests .
And no other species does anything at all like it .
Well , how are we going to think about this ?
It is , on the one hand , a biological effect , and a very large one .
Unmistakable .
Now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
Well , many theories . But how could something tie them together ?
The idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
Richard Dawkins , whom you &apos;ll be hearing later in the day , invented the term &quot; memes , &quot; and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book &quot; The Selfish Gene . &quot;
Now here am I talking about his idea .
Well , you see , it &apos;s not his . Yes -- he started it .
But it &apos;s everybody &apos;s idea now .
And he &apos;s not responsible for what I say about memes .
I &apos;m responsible for what I say about memes .
Actually , I think we &apos;re all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas , but for their likely misuses .
So it is important , I think , to Richard , and to me , that these ideas not be abused and misused .
They &apos;re very easy to misuse . That &apos;s why they &apos;re dangerous .
And it &apos;s just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another .
So we have to keep plugging away , trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread .
But it is a problem .
We don &apos;t have much time , and I &apos;m going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out , because there &apos;s a lot of other things that are going to be said .
So let me just point out : memes are like viruses .
That &apos;s what Richard said , back in &apos; 93 .
And you might think , &quot; Well , how can that be ?
I mean , a virus is -- you know , it &apos;s stuff ! What &apos;s a meme made of ? &quot;
Yesterday , Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude .
That is , there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does .
And that &apos;s what a meme is . It &apos;s an information packet with attitude .
What &apos;s a meme made of ? What are bits made of , Mom ?
Not silicon .
They &apos;re made of information , and can be carried in any physical medium .
What &apos;s a word made of ?
Sometimes when people say , &quot; Do memes exist ? &quot;
I say , &quot; Well , do words exist ? Are they in your ontology ? &quot;
If they are , words are memes that can be pronounced .
Then there &apos;s all the other memes that can &apos;t be pronounced .
There are different species of memes .
Remember the Shakers ? Gift to be simple ?
Simple , beautiful furniture ?
And , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom is that one should be celibate .
Not just the priests . Everybody .
Well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct .
But in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren &apos;t there .
And there were lots of widows and orphans , people like that , who needed a foster home .
And so they had a ready supply of converts .
And they could keep it going .
And , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever , with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts .
The idea being passed on through proselytizing , instead of through the gene line .
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they &apos;re not being passed on genetically .
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness .
After all , the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile .
It &apos;s part of their plan .
They don &apos;t have to have minds to have a plan .
I &apos;m just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective , which I recommend .
I &apos;ve not time to go into more of it .
In Jared Diamond &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; Guns , Germs and Steel , &quot; he talks about how it was germs , more than guns and steel , that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere -- that conquered the rest of the world .
When European explorers and travelers spread out , they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to , that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years , thousands of years , of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens .
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
And we &apos;re doing it again .
We &apos;re doing it this time with toxic ideas .
Yesterday , a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out , thanks to all the new technology all over the world .
And I agree . It is largely wonderful . Largely wonderful .
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
Now , this has been realized for some time .
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam , one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden .
&quot; One has only to glance at its press films , fashion shows , beauty contests , ballrooms , wine bars and broadcasting stations . &quot; Memes .
These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures .
They are wiping out languages .
They are wiping out traditions and practices .
And it &apos;s not our fault , anymore than it &apos;s our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven &apos;t developed the immunity .
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture .
We &apos;re a free society , so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off .
They &apos;re like a mild cold .
They &apos;re not a big deal for us .
But we should recognize that for many people in the world , they are a big deal .
And we should be very alert to this .
As we spread our education and our technology , one of the things that we are doing is we &apos;re the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes -- the memes that they are prepared to die for .
Well now , how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes ?
That is not the job of the science of memetics .
Memetics is morally neutral . And so it should be .
This is not the place for hate and anger .
If you &apos;ve had a friend who &apos;s died of AIDS , then you hate HIV .
But the way to deal with that is to do science , and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective .
Get the facts .
Work out the implications .
There &apos;s plenty of room for moral passion once we &apos;ve got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do .
And , as with germs , the trick is not to try to annihilate them .
You will never annihilate the germs .
What you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
That &apos;s all the time I have , so thank you very much for your attention .
Hi there . I &apos;m Hasan . I &apos;m an artist .
And usually when I tell people I &apos;m an artist , they just look at me and say , &quot; Do you paint ? &quot;
or &quot; What kind of medium do you work in ? &quot;
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique .
So what I &apos;m really interested in is creative problem solving .
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .
So let me show you a little of that .
So it started over here .
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002 .
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas .
And as I was coming back , well I was taken by the FBI , met by an FBI agent , and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- &quot; Where were you ? What were you doing ? Who were you talking with ?
Why were you there ? Who pays for your trips ? &quot; -- all these little details .
And then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot;
And when most of us get asked , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot;
or any date for that fact , it &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . &quot;
So I pulled out my little PDA , and I said , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s look up my appointments for September 12th . &quot;
I had September 12th -- from 10 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 30 a.m. , I paid my storage bill .
From 10 : 30 a.m. to 12 : 00 p.m. , I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time .
From 12 : 00 p.m. to 3 : 00 p.m. , I taught my intro class , 3 : 00 p.m. to 6 : 00 p.m. , I taught my advanced class .
&quot; Where were you the 11th ? &quot; &quot; Where were you the 10th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you October 5th ? &quot;
We read about six months of my calendar .
And I don &apos;t think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did .
But good thing I did , because I don &apos;t look good in orange .
So he asked me -- &quot; So this storage unit that you paid the rent on , what did you have in it ? &quot;
This was in Tampa , Florida , so I was like , &quot; Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida .
Furniture that I can &apos;t fit in my ratty apartment .
Just assorted garage sale junk , because I &apos;m a pack rat . &quot;
And he looks at me really confused and says , &quot; No explosives ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; No , no . I &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosives .
And if there were , I would have remembered that one . &quot;
And he &apos;s still a little confused , but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I &apos;m not exactly a terrorist threat .
And so we &apos;re sitting there , and eventually after about an hour , hour and a half of just going back and forth , he says , &quot; Okay , I have enough information here .
I &apos;m going to pass this onto the Tampa office . They &apos;re the ones who initiated this .
They &apos;ll follow up with you , and we &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Great . &quot;
So I got home and the phone rings , and a man introduced himself .
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth , not six months continuously .
By the way , you folks know that in the United States , you can &apos;t take photographs of federal buildings , but Google can do it for you .
So to the folks from Google , thank you .
So I spent a lot of time in this building .
Questions like : &quot; Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation ? &quot;
And you also have to consider the state of mind you &apos;re in when you &apos;re doing this .
You &apos;re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .
Or questions such as -- actually , during the polygraph , which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ...
well the first one was , &quot; Is your name Hasan ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Are we in Florida ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; Is today Tuesday ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
Because you have to base it on a yes or no .
Then , of course , the next question is : &quot; Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? &quot;
I work at a university .
So I was like , &quot; Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . &quot;
But they said , &quot; Okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? &quot;
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs , they said , &quot; Hey , everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
I was like , &quot; I know . That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you guys all along .
I know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
So they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
And it &apos;s like , &quot; Guys , I travel a lot . &quot;
This is with the FBI .
And I was like , &quot; All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again . &quot;
And there was a sincere concern there .
And he was like , &quot; You know , if you get into trouble , give us a call -- we &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
So ever since then , before I would go anywhere , I would call the FBI .
I would tell them , &quot; Hey guys , this is where I &apos;m going . This is my flight .
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th &quot; or whatever .
A couple weeks later , I &apos;d call again , let them know .
It wasn &apos;t that I had to , but I chose to .
Just wanted to say , &quot; Hey guys .
Don &apos;t want to make it look like I &apos;m making any sudden moves . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want you guys to think that I &apos;m about to flee .
Just letting you know . Heads up . &quot;
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over .
And then the phone calls turned into emails , and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
with pictures , with travel tips .
Then I &apos;d make websites .
And then I built this over here . Let me go back to it over here .
So I actually designed this back in 2003 .
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment .
I wrote some code for my mobile phone .
Basically , what I decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that &apos;s cool .
But I &apos;ll watch myself . It &apos;s okay .
You don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
So in the process , I start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
Well they probably have all my flight records , so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online .
So you can see , Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta .
And then you see , these are some of the meals that I &apos;ve been fed on the planes .
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .
See that ? They won &apos;t let me on a plane with that , but they &apos;ll give it to me on the plane .
These are the airports that I hang out in , because I like airports .
That &apos;s Kennedy airport , May 19th , Tuesday .
This is in Warsaw .
Singapore . You can see , they &apos;re kind of empty .
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone .
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data , then you &apos;re basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together .
And when you &apos;re in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence , you &apos;re put in the situation where you react in a very different manner .
At the time that this was going on , the last thing on my mind was &quot; art project . &quot;
I was certainly not thinking , hey , I got new work here .
But after going through this , after realizing , well what just happened ?
And after piecing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know .
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday , November 15th .
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi .
And I bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville .
And laundry too . Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland , sorry .
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick .
Now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on May 9th , that I bought $ 14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo .
So not only that I &apos;m giving this information here and there , but now there &apos;s a third party , an independent third party , my bank , that &apos;s verifying that , yes indeed , I was there at this time .
So there &apos;s points , and these points are actually being cross-referenced .
And there &apos;s a verification taking place .
Sometimes they &apos;re really small purchases .
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee .
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pops up right away .
Sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was .
And then sometimes you get this .
Sometimes you just get this , just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City , January 22nd .
And I can tell you exactly who I was with , where I was , because this is what I had to do with the FBI .
I had to tell them every little detail of everything .
I spend a lot of time on the road .
This is a parking lot in Elko , Nevada off of Route 80 at 8 : 01 p.m. on August 19th .
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
There &apos;s actually 46,000 images right now on my site , and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they &apos;ve seen all of them .
And then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all , you just get this empty bed .
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information .
So you get something like this .
This , by the way , is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich .
So there &apos;s different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations , empty gas stations .
These are some of the meals that I &apos;ve been cooking at home .
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times .
So again , you have to do some detective work here .
So sometimes the databases get so specific .
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth .
At 11 : 39 a.m. was this one .
At 1 : 56 p.m. was this one . At 4 : 59 p.m. was this one .
So I time-stamp my life every few moments .
Every few moments I shoot the image .
Now it &apos;s all done on my iPhone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
They need to know where I &apos;m doing my business , because they want to know about my business .
So on December 4th , I went here .
And on Sunday , June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan , Maine -- this was my apartment there .
So what you &apos;re basically seeing here If you go to my site , there &apos;s tons of things .
And really , it &apos;s not the most user-friendly interface .
It &apos;s actually quite user-unfriendly .
And one of the reasons , also being part of the user-unfriendliness , is that everything is there , but you have to really work through it .
So by me putting all this information out there , what I &apos;m basically telling you is I &apos;m telling you everything .
But in this barrage of noise that I &apos;m putting out , I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life .
And you know very little about me actually .
And really so I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy , particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded , there &apos;s no need to delete information anymore .
So what do you do when everything is out there ?
Well you have to take control over it .
And if I give you this information directly , it &apos;s a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces .
The other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
And the reason their information has any value is , well , because no one else has access to it .
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the FBI has has no value , so thus devaluing their currency .
And I understand that , on an individual level , it &apos;s purely symbolic .
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
started doing this , we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up .
Because it just wouldn &apos;t work if everybody was sharing everything .
And we &apos;re getting to that .
When I first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , &quot; Why would you want to tell everybody what you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re at ?
Why are you posting these photos ? &quot;
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people .
So in a way , I &apos;m glad that I &apos;m completely obsolete .
I &apos;m still doing this project , but it is obsolete , because you &apos;re all doing it .
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis , whether we &apos;re aware of it or not .
So we &apos;re creating our own archives and so on .
And you know , some of my friends have always said , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re just paranoid . Why are you doing this ?
Because no one &apos;s really watching .
No one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully .
Because it &apos;s about surveillance .
I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
And I came up with these .
So these are some of my sample logs .
And just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there .
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security .
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
Central Intelligence Agency .
Executive Office of the President .
Not really sure why they show up , but they do .
I think they kind of like to look at art .
And I &apos;m glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .
Hasan , just curious .
You said , &quot; Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone , &quot; but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .
So how many hours of the day does that take ?
HE : Almost none .
It &apos;s no different than sending a text .
It &apos;s no different than checking an email .
It &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
So it &apos;s just become another day .
I mean , when we update a status message , we don &apos;t really think about how long that &apos;s going to take .
So it &apos;s really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it &apos;s done .
And everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage , the FBI gets crazy ?
HE : Well it goes to the last point that I was at .
So it holds onto the very last point .
So if I &apos;m on a 12-hour flight , you &apos;ll see the last airport that I departed from .
Hasan , thank you very much .
You should be nice to nerds .
In fact , I &apos;d go so far as to say , if you don &apos;t already have a nerd in your life , you should get one .
I &apos;m just saying .
Scientists and engineers change the world .
I &apos;d like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure .
Now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize , because when you remove the fear of failure , impossible things suddenly become possible .
If you want to know how , ask yourself this question : What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
If you really ask yourself this question , you can &apos;t help but feel uncomfortable .
I feel a little uncomfortable .
Because when you ask it , you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you , how it keeps us from attempting great things , and life gets dull , amazing things stop happening .
Sure , good things happen , but amazing things stop happening .
Now I should be clear , I &apos;m not encouraging failure , I &apos;m discouraging fear of failure .
Because it &apos;s not failure itself that constrains us .
The path to truly new , never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .
We &apos;re tested .
And in part , that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great .
Clemenceau said , &quot; Life gets interesting when we fail , because it &apos;s a sign that we &apos;ve surpassed ourselves . &quot;
In 1895 , Lord Kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible .
In October of 1903 , the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .
And two months later on December 17th , Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina .
The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet .
That was 1903 .
One year later , the next declarations of impossibilities began .
Ferdinand Foch , a French army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army , said , &quot; Airplanes are interesting toys , but of no military value . &quot;
40 years later , aero experts coined the term transonic .
They debated , should it have one S or two ?
You see , they were having trouble in this flight regime , and it wasn &apos;t at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound .
In 1947 , there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85 .
And yet , on Tuesday , October 14th , 1947 , Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility , and in so doing , he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound .
Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad .
After 11 complete mission failures , we got our first images from space .
And on that first flight we got more data than in all U-2 missions combined .
It took a lot of failures to get there .
Since we took to the sky , we have wanted to fly faster and farther .
And to do so , we &apos;ve had to believe in impossible things .
And we &apos;ve had to refuse to fear failure .
That &apos;s still true today .
Today , we don &apos;t talk about flying transonically , or even supersonically , we talk about flying hypersonically -- not Mach 2 or Mach 3 , Mach 20 .
At Mach 20 , we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
At that speed , the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace .
We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it .
And we are flying it , or trying to .
DARPA &apos;s hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built .
It &apos;s boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket .
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse , so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory .
That &apos;s an unnatural act for a rocket .
The third stage has a camera .
We call it rocketcam .
And it &apos;s pointed at the hypersonic glider .
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one .
Now to conceal the shape , we changed the aspect ratio a little bit .
But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth .
We &apos;ve flown twice .
In the first flight , no aerodynamic control of the vehicle .
But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined .
And in the second flight , three minutes of fully-controlled , aerodynamic flight at Mach 20 .
We must fly again , because amazing , never-been-done-before things require that you fly .
You can &apos;t learn to fly at Mach 20 unless you fly .
And while there &apos;s no substitute for speed , maneuverability is a very close second .
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach , a hummingbird would take , well , days .
You see , hummingbirds are not hypersonic , but they are maneuverable .
In fact , the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards .
It can fly up , down , forwards , backwards , even upside-down .
And so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can &apos;t go , we &apos;d need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so .
This is a hummingbird drone .
It can fly in all directions , even backwards .
It can hover and rotate .
This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera .
It weighs less than one AA battery .
It does not eat nectar .
In 2008 , it flew for a whopping 20 seconds , a year later , two minutes , then six , eventually 11 .
Many prototypes crashed -- many .
But there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it .
Wow .
It &apos;s great .
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot .
Failure is part of creating new and amazing things .
We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain , or maybe even ice ; a robot that can run like a cheetah , or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human .
Or perhaps , Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man .
A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe .
One square millimeter of a gecko &apos;s footpad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae .
They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces .
Today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko &apos;s foot .
The result , a four-by-four-inch artificial nano-gecko adhesive .
can support a static load of 660 pounds .
That &apos;s enough to stick six 42-inch plasma TV &apos;s to your wall , no nails .
So much for Velcro , right ?
And it &apos;s not just passive structures , it &apos;s entire machines .
This is a spider mite .
It &apos;s one millimeter long , but it looks like Godzilla next to these micromachines .
In the world of Godzilla spider mites , we can make millions of mirrors , each one-fifth the diameter of a human hair , moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays , so that we can watch movies like &quot; Godzilla &quot; in high-def .
And if we can build machines at that scale , what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses at the microscale ?
Today we are making metals that are lighter than Styrofoam , so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can lift , but so strong that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV .
From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s storms .
There are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe .
Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the Sun .
What if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons , beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters ?
Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS .
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains .
Using a grid the size of your thumb , with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain , Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .
And his thoughts made him reach for Katie .
This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone .
And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie &apos;s hand in seven years .
That moment mattered to Tim and Katie , and this green goo may someday matter to you .
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life .
It was made in tobacco plants .
Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
And if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy , what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can &apos;t solve ?
Last September , the gamers of Foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys .
Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments .
For 15 years , it was unsolved in the scientific community .
The gamers of Foldit solved it in 15 days .
Now they were able to do so by working together .
They were able to work together because they &apos;re connected by the Internet .
And others , also connected to the Internet , used it as an instrument of democracy .
And together they changed the fate of their nation .
The Internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world &apos;s population .
It allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
It allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group .
But it too had humble beginnings .
In 1969 , the internet was but a dream , a few sketches on a piece of paper .
And then on October 29th , the first packet-switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI .
The first two letters of the word &quot; Login , &quot; that &apos;s all that made it through -- an L and an O -- and then a buffer overflow crashed the system .
Two letters , an L and an O , now a worldwide force .
So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA ?
They are nerds , and they are heroes among us .
They challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions .
They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure .
They remind us that we all have nerd power .
Sometimes we just forget .
You see , there was a time when you weren &apos;t afraid of failure , when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing , you were good at math , you could build things , you were an astronaut , an adventurer , Jacques Cousteau , you could jump higher , run faster , kick harder than anyone .
You believed in impossible things and you were fearless .
You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero .
Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world .
So can you .
You were born to .
So go ahead , ask yourself , what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
Now I want to say , this is not easy .
It &apos;s hard to hold onto this feeling , really hard .
I guess in some way , I sort of believe it &apos;s supposed to be hard .
Doubt and fear always creep in .
We think someone else , someone smarter than us , someone more capable , someone with more resources will solve that problem .
But there isn &apos;t anyone else ; there &apos;s just you .
And if we &apos;re lucky , in that moment , someone steps into that doubt and fear , takes a hand and says , &quot; Let me help you believe . &quot;
Jason Harley did that for me .
Jason started at DARPA on March 18th , 2010 .
He was with our transportation team .
I saw Jason nearly every day , sometimes twice a day .
And more so than most , he saw the highs and the lows , the celebrations and the disappointments .
And on one particularly dark day for me , Jason sat down and he wrote an email .
He was encouraging , but firm .
And when he hit send , he probably didn &apos;t realize what a difference it would make .
It mattered to me .
In that moment and still today when I doubt , when I feel afraid , when I need to reconnect with that feeling , I remember his words , they were so powerful .
Text : &quot; There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you . &quot;
Superhero , superhero . Superhero , superhero . Superhero , superhero . Superhero , superhero . Superhero , superhero . Voice : Because that &apos;s what being a superhero is all about .
&quot; There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you . &quot;
And remember , be nice to nerds .
Thank you . Thank you .
Regina , thank you .
I have a couple of questions .
So that glider of yours , the Mach 20 glider , the first one , no control , it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere .
Yeah , yeah . It did .
Yeah , it also went into the Pacific .
We didn &apos;t fly it into the Pacific .
No , there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed .
And so in the second flight , we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it .
I imagine you &apos;re not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach anytime soon .
It might be a little warm .
What do you picture that glider being used for ?
Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this .
How it &apos;s ultimately used will be determined by the military .
Now the purpose of the vehicle though , the purpose of the technology , is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes .
And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds ?
Like what &apos;s the payload it could carry ?
Well I don &apos;t think we ultimately know what it will be , right .
We &apos;ve got to fly it first .
But not necessarily just a camera ?
No , not necessarily just a camera .
It &apos;s amazing .
The hummingbird ?
Yeah ?
I &apos;m curious , you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly , and there haven &apos;t been that many planes built since that flap wings .
Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird ?
Isn &apos;t that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object ?
So I mean , in part , we wondered if it was possible to do it .
And you have to revisit these questions over time .
The folks at AeroVironment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the avionics .
It took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly .
But there &apos;s something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you &apos;d recognize .
So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing , but when things looks just natural , you also don &apos;t see them .
Ah . So it &apos;s not necessarily just the performance .
It &apos;s partly the look .
It &apos;s actually , &quot; Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters . &quot;
Because I think , as well as the awe of looking at that , I &apos;m sure some people here are thinking , technology catches up so quick , how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the White House ?
I mean , do you worry about the Pandora &apos;s box issue here ?
Well look , our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .
That &apos;s what we do .
It would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn &apos;t make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time .
It &apos;s just the nature of what we do .
Now our responsibility is to push that edge .
And we have to be , of course , mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used , but we can &apos;t simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn &apos;t advancing ; it &apos;s advancing .
I mean , you &apos;re clearly a really inspiring leader .
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention , but at a personal level , in a way I can &apos;t imagine doing your job .
Do you wake up in the night sometimes , just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team &apos;s brilliance ?
Sure .
I think you couldn &apos;t be human if you didn &apos;t ask those questions .
How do you answer them ?
Well I don &apos;t always have answers for them , right .
I think that we learn as time goes on .
My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have .
I work with some of the most amazing people .
And with that exhilaration , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what &apos;s possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means .
Regina , that was jaw-dropping , as they say .
Thank you so much for coming to TED .
If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life , I would have told you that I &apos;d just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi , the Chinese equivalency exam , and I was going to go study law in Beijing , and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms .
I had a plan , and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo .
Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room .
And it was Doc Watson singing and playing &quot; Shady Grove . &quot;
Shady Grove , my little love Shady Grove , my darlin &apos; Shady Grove , my little love Going back to Harlan That sound was just so beautiful , the sound of Doc &apos;s voice and the rippling groove of the banjo .
And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture , it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome .
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China .
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo , I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs , and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention .
And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me .
And they said , &quot; Hey , do you want to jam ? &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Sure . &quot;
So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them .
And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville , Tennessee to make a record .
It &apos;s been eight years , and I can tell you that I didn &apos;t go to China to become a lawyer .
In fact , I went to Nashville .
And after a few months I was writing songs .
And the first song I wrote was in English , and the second one was in Chinese .
&#91; Chinese &#93; Outside your door the world is waiting .
Inside your heart a voice is calling .
The four corners of the world are watching , so travel daughter , travel .
Go get it , girl .
It &apos;s really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky .
And I &apos;ve played thousands of shows .
And I &apos;ve collaborated with so many incredible , inspirational musicians around the world .
And I see the power of music .
I see the power of music to connect cultures .
I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese .
&#91; Chinese &#93; And everybody &apos;s eyes just pop wide open like it &apos;s going to fall out of their heads .
And they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s that girl doing ? &quot;
And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story .
They all come up and they &apos;re like , &quot; You know , my aunt &apos;s sister &apos;s babysitter &apos;s dog &apos;s chicken went to China and adopted a girl . &quot;
And I tell you what , it like everybody &apos;s got a story .
It &apos;s just incredible .
And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument , and she &apos;s singing their music .
And I see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone .
And this little girl comes up to me .
&#91; Chinese &#93; &quot; Big sister Wong , &quot; Washburn , Wong , same difference .
&quot; Big sister Wong , can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake ? &quot;
And I sat down , she sat on my lap .
She started singing her song .
And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks , and I started to cry .
And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever .
And in that moment , we weren &apos;t our American selves , we weren &apos;t our Chinese selves , we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here .
I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone .
And I know U.S.-China relations doesn &apos;t need another lawyer .
Thank you .
It is a thrill to be here at a conference that &apos;s devoted to &quot; Inspired by Nature &quot; -- you can imagine .
And I &apos;m also thrilled to be in the foreplay section .
Did you notice this section is foreplay ?
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters , which is the Western Grebe . You haven &apos;t lived until you &apos;ve seen these guys do their courtship dance .
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and I have a rowing shell .
And so we were rowing , and one of these Western Grebes came along .
And what they do for their courtship dance is , they go together , the two of them , the two mates , and they begin to run underwater .
They paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing .
And so we &apos;re in a skull , and we &apos;re moving really , really quickly .
And this Grebe , I think , sort of , mistaked us for a prospect , and started to run along the water next to us , in a courtship dance -- for miles .
It would stop , and then start , and then stop , and then start .
Now that is foreplay .
I came this close to changing species at that moment .
Obviously , life can teach us something in the entertainment section . Life has a lot to teach us .
But what I &apos;d like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design .
What &apos;s happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what &apos;s happened since then is architects , designers , engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say , we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us , in real time , become inspired .
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . We &apos;ll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers ; they purify wastewater .
And some of them were very resistant , actually , to being there .
What they said to us at first was , you know , we already do biomimicry .
We use bacteria to clean our water . And we said , well , that &apos;s not exactly being inspired by nature .
That &apos;s bioprocessing , you know ; that &apos;s bio-assisted technology : using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old , old technology called &quot; domestication . &quot;
This is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it .
And so they still weren &apos;t getting it .
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said , well , give me one of your big problems . Give me a design challenge , sustainability speed bump , that &apos;s keeping you from being sustainable .
And they said scaling , which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes .
And they said , you know what happens is , mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .
And then the aperture closes , and we have to flush the pipes with toxins , or we have to dig them up .
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach . And I asked them , what is scaling ? What &apos;s inside your pipes ?
And they said , calcium carbonate .
And I said , that &apos;s what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
And they didn &apos;t know that .
They didn &apos;t know that what a seashell is , it &apos;s templated by proteins , and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell .
So the same sort of a process , without the proteins , is happening on the inside of their pipes . They didn &apos;t know .
This is not for lack of information ; it &apos;s a lack of integration .
You know , it &apos;s a silo , people in silos . They didn &apos;t know that the same thing was happening . So one of them thought about it and said , OK , well , if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren &apos;t shells infinite in size ? What stops the scaling ?
Why don &apos;t they just keep on going ?
And I said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal .
And , in fact , there is a product called TPA that &apos;s mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it &apos;s an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes .
That changed everything . From then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
The first day they would take a hike , and it was , click , click , click , click . Five minutes later they were back in the boat .
We &apos;re done . You know , I &apos;ve seen that island .
After this , they were crawling all over . They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel .
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve .
Learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
That &apos;s the profound switch .
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere ; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world .
3.8 billion years of field-testing .
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you ; I think there &apos;s a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions .
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context .
And the context is the Earth -- the same context that we &apos;re trying to solve our problems in .
So it &apos;s the conscious emulation of life &apos;s genius .
It &apos;s not slavishly mimicking -- although Al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it &apos;s not a slavish mimicry ; it &apos;s taking the design principles , the genius of the natural world , and learning something from it .
Now , in a group with so many IT people , I do have to mention what I &apos;m not going to talk about , and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things , on the software side . So there &apos;s computers that protect themselves , like an immune system , and we &apos;re learning from gene regulation and biological development . And we &apos;re learning from neural nets , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computing .
That &apos;s on the software side . But what &apos;s interesting to me is that we haven &apos;t looked at this , as much . I mean , these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there &apos;s dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley .
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers , but everything ?
The plane you came in , cars , the seats that you &apos;re sitting on .
How do we redesign the world that we make , the human-made world ?
More importantly , what should we ask in the next 10 years ?
And there &apos;s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .
What &apos;s the syllabus ?
Three questions , for me , are key .
How does life make things ?
This is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
It &apos;s called heat , beat and treat -- that &apos;s what material scientists call it .
And it &apos;s carving things down from the top , with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product . You heat it up ; you beat it with high pressures ; you use chemicals . OK . Heat , beat and treat .
Life can &apos;t afford to do that . How does life make things ?
How does life make the most of things ?
That &apos;s a geranium pollen .
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily . Look at that shape .
Life adds information to matter .
In other words : structure .
It gives it information . By adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
And thirdly , how does life make things disappear into systems ?
Because life doesn &apos;t really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems .
Really quick syllabus .
As I &apos;m reading more and more now , and following the story , there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences .
And at the same time , I &apos;m listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are .
The two groups are not talking to each other .
At all .
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture , to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we &apos;re in ?
I &apos;m going to try to go through 12 , really quickly .
One that &apos;s exciting to me is self-assembly .
Now , you &apos;ve heard about this in terms of nanotechnology .
Back to that shell : the shell is a self-assembling material .
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater . It &apos;s a layered structure that &apos;s mineral and then polymer , and it makes it very , very tough .
It &apos;s twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics .
But what &apos;s really interesting : unlike our ceramics that are in kilns , it happens in seawater . It happens near , in and near , the organism &apos;s body .
This is Sandia National Labs .
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process .
Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid , lifting it out of the liquid , and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together , so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works .
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell , to a solar cell , onto a roof , and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light .
Here &apos;s an interesting one for the IT world : bio-silicon . This is a diatom , which is made of silicates .
And so silicon , which we make right now -- it &apos;s part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that &apos;s now being mimicked .
This is at UC Santa Barbara . Look at these diatoms .
This is from Ernst Haeckel &apos;s work .
Imagine being able to -- and , again , it &apos;s a templated process , and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses .
On the left , this is a brittle star ; it &apos;s covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever .
It &apos;s one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of .
And there &apos;s many of them , all over its entire body .
What &apos;s interesting , again , is that it self-assembles .
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg , at Lucent , is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses . She &apos;s also looking at fiber optics .
That &apos;s a sea sponge that has a fiber optic .
Down at the very base of it , there &apos;s fiber optics that work better than ours , actually , to move light , but you can tie them in a knot ; they &apos;re incredibly flexible .
Here &apos;s another big idea : CO2 as a feedstock .
A guy named Geoff Coates , at Cornell , said to himself , you know , plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time .
We see it that way . Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose , right , out of CO2 . He &apos;s found a way -- he &apos;s found a catalyst -- and he &apos;s found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates . Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 -- how plant-like .
Solar transformations : the most exciting one .
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium , the people at ASU . Even more interesting , lately , in the last couple of weeks , people have seen that there &apos;s an enzyme called hydrogenase that &apos;s able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons , and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what &apos;s happening in a fuel cell , in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell .
In our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase .
That &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum .
Power of shape : here &apos;s a whale . We &apos;ve seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them . And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings , if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing .
Color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
Light comes through , it bounces back off the layers ; it &apos;s called thin-film interference . Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color .
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface , so that it &apos;s self-cleaning with just water . That &apos;s what a leaf does .
See that up-close picture ?
That &apos;s a ball of water , and those are dirt particles .
And that &apos;s an up-close picture of a lotus leaf .
There &apos;s a company making a product called Lotusan , which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries , it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf , and rainwater cleans the building .
Water is going to be our big , grand challenge : quenching thirst .
Here are two organisms that pull water .
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog .
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air , does not drink fresh water .
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta , before it gets into a building , are key technologies .
Separation technologies are going to be extremely important .
What if we were to say , no more hard rock mining ?
What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams , small amounts of metals in water ? That &apos;s what microbes do ; they chelate metals out of water .
There &apos;s a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes &apos; molecules on filters to mine waste streams .
Green chemistry is chemistry in water .
We do chemistry in organic solvents .
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider . Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature &apos;s recipe book .
It &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
And we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table , and create miracle materials like that cell , is the task of green chemistry .
Timed degradation : packaging that is good until you don &apos;t want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue .
That &apos;s a mussel you can find in the waters out here , and the threads holding it to a rock are timed ; at exactly two years , they begin to dissolve .
Healing : this is a good one .
That little guy over there is a tardigrade .
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what &apos;s called the &quot; cold chain &quot; gets broken .
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely , and yet stays alive for months and months and months , and is able to regenerate itself .
And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated .
They can be put in a glove compartment , OK .
Learning from organisms . This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water , in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration .
I &apos;m not going to get to 12 .
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing , besides all of these adaptations , is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that &apos;s going to take care of their offspring .
When they &apos;re involved in foreplay , they &apos;re thinking about something very , very important -- and that &apos;s having their genetic material remain , 10,000 generations from now .
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that &apos;ll take care of their offspring .
That &apos;s the biggest design challenge .
Luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
Good luck having a conversation with them .
Thank you .
Talk about foreplay , I -- we need to get to 12 , but really quickly .
Janine Benyus : Oh really ?
Yeah . Just like , you know , like the 10-second version of 10 , 11 and 12 . Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous , and the ideas are so big , I can &apos;t stand to let you go down without seeing 10 , 11 and 12 .
JB : OK , put this -- OK , I &apos;ll just hold this thing . OK , great .
OK , so that &apos;s the healing one .
Sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
This is a locust . There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer , and yet they don &apos;t collide with one another .
And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year .
Right . There &apos;s a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it &apos;s a very large neuron .
And she &apos;s actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust .
This is a huge and important one , number 11 .
And that &apos;s the growing fertility .
That means , you know , net fertility farming .
We should be growing fertility . And , oh yes -- we get food , too .
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
And really , that &apos;s what other organisms do as well .
In ensemble , that &apos;s what whole ecosystems do : they create more and more opportunities for life .
Our farming has done the opposite .
So , farming based on how a prairie builds soil , ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range , even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water , but creates incredibly sparkling productivity .
This is the simple design brief . I mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3.8 billion years , has worked this out .
That is , those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places , are not around to tell us about it .
That &apos;s the twelfth one .
Life -- and this is the secret trick ; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life .
It builds soil ; it cleans air ; it cleans water ; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live .
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs . So it &apos;s not mutually exclusive .
We have to find a way to meet our needs , while making of this place an Eden .
Janine , thank you so much .
Philosophers , dramatists , theologians have grappled with this question for centuries : what makes people go wrong ?
Interestingly , I asked this question when I was a little kid .
When I was a kid growing up in the South Bronx , inner-city ghetto in New York , I was surrounded by evil , as all kids are who grew up in an inner city .
And I had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson .
That is , they took drugs , got in trouble , went to jail .
Some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance .
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson , that wasn &apos;t fiction .
The only question is , what was in the juice ?
And more importantly , that line between good and evil -- which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable , with them on the good side , and the others on the bad side -- I knew that line was movable , and it was permeable .
Good people could be seduced across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could recover with help , with reform , with rehabilitation .
So I want to begin with this this wonderful illusion by &#91; Dutch &#93; artist M.C. Escher .
If you look at it and focus on the white , what you see is a world full of angels .
But let &apos;s look more deeply , and as we do , what appears is the demons , the devils in the world .
And that tells us several things .
One , the world is , was , will always be filled with good and evil , because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition .
It tells me something else . If you remember , God &apos;s favorite angel was Lucifer .
Apparently , Lucifer means &quot; the light . &quot;
It also means &quot; the morning star , &quot; in some scripture .
And apparently , he disobeyed God , and that &apos;s the ultimate disobedience to authority .
And when he did , Michael , the archangel , was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels .
And so Lucifer descends into hell , becomes Satan , becomes the devil , and the force of evil in the universe begins .
Paradoxically , it was God who created hell as a place to store evil .
He didn &apos;t do a good job of keeping it there though .
So , this arc of the cosmic transformation of God &apos;s favorite angel into the Devil , for me , sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good , ordinary people into perpetrators of evil .
So the Lucifer effect , although it focuses on the negatives -- the negatives that people can become , not the negatives that people are -- leads me to a psychological definition . Evil is the exercise of power .
And that &apos;s the key : it &apos;s about power .
To intentionally harm people psychologically , to hurt people physically , to destroy people mortally , or ideas , and to commit crimes against humanity .
If you Google &quot; evil , &quot; a word that should surely have withered by now , you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second .
A few years ago -- I am sure all of you were shocked , as I was , with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war , Abu Ghraib in Iraq .
And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation .
I was shocked , but I wasn &apos;t surprised , because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study .
Immediately the Bush administration military said ... what ?
What all administrations say when there &apos;s a scandal .
&quot; Don &apos;t blame us . It &apos;s not the system . It &apos;s the few bad apples , the few rogue soldiers . &quot;
My hypothesis is , American soldiers are good , usually .
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad .
But how am I going to -- how am I going to deal with that hypothesis ?
I became an expert witness for one of the guards , Sergeant Chip Frederick , and in that position , I had access to the dozen investigative reports .
I had access to him . I could study him , have him come to my home , get to know him , do psychological analysis to see , was he a good apple or bad apple .
And thirdly , I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took .
These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature .
All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers .
Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera , they took pictures of everything . More than 1,000 .
And what I &apos;ve done is I organized them into various categories .
But these are by United States military police , army reservists .
They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all .
And it all happened in a single place , Tier 1-A , on the night shift .
Why ? Tier 1-A was the center for military intelligence .
It was the interrogation hold . The CIA was there .
Interrogators from Titan Corporation , all there , and they &apos;re getting no information about the insurgency .
So they &apos;re going to put pressure on these soldiers , military police , to cross the line , give them permission to break the will of the enemy , to prepare them for interrogation , to soften them up , to take the gloves off . Those are the euphemisms , and this is how it was interpreted .
Let &apos;s go down to that dungeon .
So , pretty horrific .
That &apos;s one of the visual illustrations of evil .
And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill .
That prisoner covered himself with shit every day , and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn &apos;t stink .
But the guards ended up calling him &quot; Shit Boy . &quot;
What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution ?
In any event , here &apos;s former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld .
He comes down and says , &quot; I want to know , who is responsible ?
Who are the bad apples ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s a bad question .
You have to reframe it and ask , &quot; What is responsible ? &quot;
Because &quot; what &quot; could be the who of people , but it could also be the what of the situation , and obviously that &apos;s wrongheaded .
So how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character , if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon ?
There are three ways . The main way is -- it &apos;s called dispositional .
We look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad apples .
This is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
Social psychologists like me come along and say , &quot; Yeah , people are the actors on the stage , but you &apos;ll have to be aware of what that situation is .
Who are the cast of characters ? What &apos;s the costume ?
Is there a stage director ? &quot;
And so we &apos;re interested in , what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?
And social scientists stop there , and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib .
The power is in the system .
The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals , and the system is the legal , political , economic , cultural background .
And this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers .
So if you want to change a person , you &apos;ve got to change the situation .
If you want to change the situation , you &apos;ve got to know where the power is , in the system .
So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors .
And it &apos;s a dynamic interplay .
What do the people bring into the situation ?
What does the situation bring out of them ?
And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation ?
So my book , &quot; The Lucifer Effect , &quot; recently published , is about , how do you understand how good people turn evil ?
And it has a lot of detail about what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
So Dr. Z &apos;s &quot; Lucifer Effect , &quot; although it focuses on evil , really is a celebration of the human mind &apos;s infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel , caring or indifferent , creative or destructive , and it makes some of us villains .
And the good news story that I &apos;m going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes .
This is a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker , which really summarizes my whole talk : &quot; I &apos;m neither a good cop nor a bad cop , Jerome .
Like yourself , I &apos;m a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not , depending on the circumstances . &quot;
There &apos;s a study some of you think you know about , but very few people have ever read the story . You watched the movie .
This is Stanley Milgram , little Jewish kid from the Bronx , and he asked the question , &quot; Could the Holocaust happen here , now ? &quot;
People say , &quot; No , that &apos;s Nazi Germany , that &apos;s Hitler , you know , that &apos;s 1939 . &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , but suppose Hitler asked you , &apos; Would you electrocute a stranger ? &apos; &apos; No way , not me , I &apos;m a good person . &apos; &quot; He said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do ? &quot;
And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people .
500 New Haven , Connecticut , 500 Bridgeport .
And the ad said , &quot; Psychologists want to understand memory .
We want to improve people &apos;s memory , because memory is the key to success . &quot; OK ?
&quot; We &apos;re going to give you five bucks -- four dollars for your time . &quot;
And it said , &quot; We don &apos;t want college students .
We want men between 20 and 50 . &quot;
In the later studies , they ran women .
Ordinary people : barbers , clerks , white-collar people .
So , you go down , and one of you is going to be a learner , and one of you is going to be a teacher .
The learner &apos;s a genial , middle-aged guy .
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .
The learner could be middle-aged , could be as young as 20 .
And one of you is told by the authority , the guy in the lab coat , &quot; Your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn .
Gets it right , reward him .
Gets it wrong , you press a button on the shock box .
The first button is 15 volts . He doesn &apos;t even feel it . &quot;
That &apos;s the key . All evil starts with 15 volts .
And then the next step is another 15 volts .
The problem is , at the end of the line , it &apos;s 450 volts .
And as you go along , the guy is screaming , &quot; I &apos;ve got a heart condition ! I &apos;m out of here ! &quot;
You &apos;re a good person . You complain .
&quot; Sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
The experimenter says , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , I will be responsible .
Continue , teacher . &quot;
And the question is , who would go all the way to 450 volts ?
You should notice here , when it gets up to 375 , it says , &quot; Danger . Severe Shock . &quot;
When it gets up to here , there &apos;s &quot; XXX &quot; -- the pornography of power .
So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists , &quot; What percent of American citizens would go to the end ? &quot;
They said only one percent . Because that &apos;s sadistic behavior , and we know , psychiatry knows , only one percent of Americans are sadistic .
OK . Here &apos;s the data . They could not be more wrong .
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts . This was just one study .
Milgram did more than 16 studies . And look at this .
In study 16 , where you see somebody like you go all the way , 90 percent go all the way . In study five , if you see people rebel , 90 percent rebel .
What about women ? Study 13 -- no different than men .
So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority , to go all the way to 450 volts .
And it &apos;s like a dial on human nature .
A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient , down to the majority , down to none .
So what are the external parallels ? For all research is artificial .
What &apos;s the validity in the real world ?
912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978 , because they were blindly obedient to this guy , their pastor -- not their priest -- their pastor , Reverend Jim Jones .
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide .
And so , he &apos;s the modern Lucifer effect , a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death .
Milgram &apos;s study is all about individual authority to control people .
Most of the time , we are in institutions , so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
Interestingly , Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx , 1954 .
So this study , which I did with my graduate students , especially Craig Haney -- we also began work with an ad .
We didn &apos;t have money , so we had a cheap , little ad , but we wanted college students for a study of prison life .
75 people volunteered , took personality tests .
We did interviews . Picked two dozen : the most normal , the most healthy .
Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard .
So on day one , we knew we had good apples .
I &apos;m going to put them in a bad situation .
And secondly , we know there &apos;s no difference between the boys who are going to be guards and the boys who are going to be prisoners .
The kids who were going to be prisoners , we said , &quot; Wait at home in the dormitories . The study will begin Sunday . &quot;
We didn &apos;t tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests .
Student : A police car pulls up in front , and a cop comes to the front door , and knocks , and says he &apos;s looking for me .
So they , right there , you know , they took me out the door , they put my hands against the car .
It was a real cop car , it was a real policeman , and there were real neighbors in the street , who didn &apos;t know that this was an experiment .
And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around .
They put me in the car , then they drove me around Palo Alto .
They took me to the police station , the basement of the police station . Then they put me in a cell .
I was the first one to be picked up , so they put me in a cell , which was just like a room with a door with bars on it .
You could tell it wasn &apos;t a real jail .
They locked me in there , in this degrading little outfit .
They were taking this experiment too seriously .
Philip Zimbardo : Here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized .
They &apos;re going to become numbers .
Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands , to do other humiliating tasks .
They strip them naked . They sexually taunt them .
They begin to do degrading activities , like having them simulate sodomy .
You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib .
My guards did it in five days . The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within 36 hours .
The study ended after six days , because it was out of control .
Five kids had emotional breakdowns .
Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not ?
Does it make a difference if they &apos;re anonymous , in how they treat their victims ?
We know in some cultures , they go to war , they don &apos;t change their appearance .
In other cultures , they paint themselves like &quot; Lord of the Flies . &quot;
In some , they wear masks .
In many , soldiers are anonymous in uniform .
So this anthropologist , John Watson , found 23 cultures that had two bits of data .
Do they change their appearance ? 15 .
Do they kill , torture , mutilate ? 13 .
If they don &apos;t change their appearance , only one of eight kills , tortures or mutilates .
The key is in the red zone .
If they change their appearance , 12 of 13 -- that &apos;s 90 percent -- kill , torture , mutilate .
And that &apos;s the power of anonymity .
So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil ?
Mindlessly taking the first small step .
Dehumanization of others . De-individuation of Self .
Diffusion of personal responsibility . Blind obedience to authority .
Uncritical conformity to group norms .
Passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference .
And it happens when you &apos;re in a new or unfamiliar situation .
Your habitual response patterns don &apos;t work .
Your personality and morality are disengaged .
&quot; Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer ; nothing more difficult than understanding him , &quot; Dostoyevksy tells us .
Understanding is not excusing . Psychology is not excuse-iology .
So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary , good people can be transformed without the drugs .
You don &apos;t need it . You just need the social-psychological processes .
Real world parallels ? Compare this with this .
James Schlesinger -- and I &apos;m going to have to end with this -- says , &quot; Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances . &quot;
That &apos;s the Lucifer effect .
And he goes on to say , &quot; The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations . &quot;
If you give people power without oversight , it &apos;s a prescription for abuse . They knew that , and let that happen .
So another report , an investigative report by General Fay , says the system is guilty . And in this report , he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib , by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse , and the fact that it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time .
Those abuses went on for three months . Who was watching the store ?
The answer is nobody , and , I think , nobody on purpose .
He gave the guards permission to do those things , and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon .
So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas .
The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual .
The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease .
Bullying is a disease . Prejudice is a disease . Violence is a disease .
And since the Inquisition , we &apos;ve been dealing with problems at the individual level . And you know what ? It doesn &apos;t work .
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says , &quot; The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
That means that line is not out there .
That &apos;s a decision that you have to make . That &apos;s a personal thing .
So I want to end very quickly on a positive note .
Heroism as the antidote to evil , by promoting the heroic imagination , especially in our kids , in our educational system .
We want kids to think , I &apos;m the hero in waiting , waiting for the right situation to come along , and I will act heroically .
My whole life is now going to focus away from evil -- that I &apos;ve been in since I was a kid -- to understanding heroes .
Banality of heroism is , it &apos;s ordinary people who do heroic deeds .
It &apos;s the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt &apos;s &quot; Banality of Evil . &quot;
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong , because they are the exceptions .
They organize their whole life around this .
That &apos;s why we know their names .
And our kids &apos; heroes are also wrong models for them , because they have supernatural talents .
We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people , and the heroic act is unusual . This is Joe Darby .
He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw , because when he saw those images , he turned them over to a senior investigating officer .
He was a low-level private , and that stopped it . Was he a hero ? No .
They had to put him in hiding , because people wanted to kill him , and then his mother and his wife .
For three years , they were in hiding .
This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study .
When I said it got out of control , I was the prison superintendent .
I didn &apos;t know it was out of control . I was totally indifferent .
She came down , saw that madhouse and said , &quot; You know what , it &apos;s terrible what you &apos;re doing to those boys .
They &apos;re not prisoners , they &apos;re not guards , they &apos;re boys , and you are responsible . &quot;
And I ended the study the next day .
The good news is I married her the next year .
I just came to my senses , obviously .
So situations have the power to do , through -- but the point is , this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us , that makes us perpetrators of evil , can inspire the heroic imagination in others . It &apos;s the same situation .
And you &apos;re on one side or the other .
Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction , because your mother said , &quot; Don &apos;t get involved . Mind your own business . &quot;
And you have to say , &quot; Mama , humanity is my business . &quot;
So the psychology of heroism is -- we &apos;re going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses , that I &apos;m working with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination , this self-labeling , &quot; I am a hero in waiting , &quot; and teach them skills .
To be a hero , you have to learn to be a deviant , because you &apos;re always going against the conformity of the group .
Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary . Who act .
The key to heroism is two things .
you &apos;ve got to act when other people are passive .
B : you have to act socio-centrically , not egocentrically .
And I want to end with the story that some of you know , about Wesley Autrey , New York subway hero .
Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker .
He &apos;s standing on a subway in New York .
A white guy falls on the tracks .
The subway train is coming . There &apos;s 75 people there .
You know what ? They freeze .
He &apos;s got a reason not to get involved .
He &apos;s black , the guy &apos;s white , and he &apos;s got two little kids .
Instead , he gives his kids to a stranger , jumps on the tracks , puts the guy between the tracks , lies on him , the subway goes over him .
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .
The train clearance is 21 inches .
A half an inch would have taken his head off .
And he said , &quot; I did what anyone could do , &quot; no big deal to jump on the tracks .
And the moral imperative is &quot; I did what everyone should do . &quot;
And so one day , you will be in a new situation .
Take path one , you &apos;re going to be a perpetrator of evil .
Evil , meaning you &apos;re going to be Arthur Andersen .
You &apos;re going to cheat , or you &apos;re going to allow bullying .
Path two , you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .
Path three , you become a hero .
The point is , are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes , waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action ?
Because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you &apos;ll always know , I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by .
So the point is thinking it and then doing it .
So I want to thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Let &apos;s oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad , and let &apos;s focus on the positive .
Advocate for respect of personal dignity , for justice and peace , which sadly our administration has not been doing .
Thanks so much .

Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
I last did a TEDTalk I think about seven years ago or so .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
And so many people , I guess , watch those videos .
People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce , which is a wonderful thing in the short term -- but it &apos;s proven to be less than ideal over seven years .
And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me .
The theme of this morning &apos;s session is Things We Make .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era .
And the man &apos;s name is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 1880 .
And he was Swiss .
And of course , the Swiss can be divided into two general categories : those who make small , exquisite , expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small , exquisite , expensive objects .
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp .
He &apos;s an engineer .
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich .
In fact , one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small , expensive , exquisite objects .
And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl .
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word .
He wears three-piece suits ; and he has a very , very small , important mustache ; and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego ; and he works 16-hour days ; and he has very strong feelings about alternating current ; and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness ; and he drinks lots of coffee ; and he does his best work sitting in his mother &apos;s kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule .
In any case , Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan .
And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane .
Now if you think about it , in the age before GPS and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
You &apos;ve got a plane that &apos;s thousands of feet up in the air , going at hundreds of miles an hour , and you &apos;re trying to drop an object , a bomb , towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments .
And all sorts of people , moving up to the First World War and between the wars , tried to solve this problem , and nearly everybody came up short .
The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code .
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings and gadgets and gauges .
And he makes this complicated thing .
And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object , visually sight the target , because they &apos;re in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber , and then they plug in the altitude of the plane , the speed of the plane , the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target .
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb .
And as Norden famously says , &quot; Before that bombsight came along , bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more . &quot;
But he said , with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft .
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like manna from heaven .
Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War , where millions of men fought each other in the trenches , getting nowhere , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy .
And the U.S. military spends 1.5 billion dollars -- billion dollars in 1940 dollars -- developing the Norden bombsight .
And to put that in perspective , the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars .
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .
And there were people , strategists , within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese .
And for Norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because Norden was a committed Christian .
In fact , he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention , because in his eyes , only God could invent things .
He was simple the instrument of God &apos;s will .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
Well God &apos;s will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .
So in the years leading up to the Second World War , the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $ 14,000 each -- again , in 1940 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive , months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers ; they &apos;re not easy to use .
And they make everyone of those bombardiers take an oath , to swear that if they &apos;re ever captured , they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy , because it &apos;s imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology .
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane , it &apos;s escorted there by a series of armed guards .
And it &apos;s carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
And there &apos;s a little incendiary device inside of it , so that , if the plane ever crashes , it will be destroyed and there &apos;s no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it .
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail .
So what happens during the Second World War ?
Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the Holy Grail .
In practice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions .
And of course , in wartime , conditions aren &apos;t perfect .
First of all , it &apos;s really hard to use -- really hard to use .
And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer .
Secondly , it breaks down a lot .
It &apos;s full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle .
Thirdly , when Norden was making his calculations , he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes .
Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those conditions .
But most of all , the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target .
But of course , what happens in real life ?
There are clouds , right .
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate .
Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
Not a lot .
And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was , there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna , Germany .
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
And over the course of 22 bombing missions , the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant , using the Norden bombsight .
Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
And of those 10 percent that landed , 16 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were duds .
The Leuna chemical plant , after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war , was up and running within weeks .
And by the way , all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis ?
Well it turns out that Carl Norden , as a proper Swiss , was very enamored of German engineers .
So in the 1930s , he hired a whole bunch of them , including a man named Hermann Long who , in 1938 , gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis .
So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war -- which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well .
So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights .
We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they &apos;ve invented gadgets that will forever change our world .
They &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
They &apos;ve invented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better .
If you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of Carl Nordens as well .
If you go to the Pentagon , they will say , &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . &quot;
And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now .
But we need to be very clear about how little that means .
In the Iraq War , at the beginning of the first Iraq War , the U.S. military , the air force , sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor .
And their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers , those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis ?
The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers .
And so they flew missions day and night , and they dropped thousands of bombs , and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge .
And after the war was over , there was an audit done -- as the army always does , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many Scuds did we actually destroy ?
You know what the answer was ?
Zero , not a single one .
Now why is that ?
Is it because their weapons weren &apos;t accurate ?
Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft .
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the Scud launchers were .
The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel , it &apos;s knowing how to find the pickle barrel .
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
What is the signature weapon of the CIA &apos;s war in Northwest Pakistan ?
It &apos;s the drone . What is the drone ?
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan , the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles , and it &apos;s used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants .
Now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes .
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .
But do you know what the crucial thing is ?
In that exact same period that we &apos;ve been using these drones with devastating accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks , against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold .
As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them , they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us .
I have not described to you a success story .
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make .
We think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
The issue isn &apos;t the accuracy of the bombs you have , it &apos;s how you use the bombs you have , and more importantly , whether you ought to use bombs at all .
There &apos;s a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight .
And that is , on August 6th , 1945 , a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima .
And as was typical with the Norden bombsight , the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft .
But of course , it didn &apos;t matter .
And that &apos;s the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
the air force &apos;s 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all .
Meanwhile , back in New York , no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima .
He was a committed Christian .
He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war .
It would have broken his heart .
My travels to Afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , Poland .
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother &apos;s tales .
A land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century .
Behind the destruction , I found a soul of places .
I met humble people .
I heard their prayer and ate their bread .
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains , Middle East , North Africa , Russia .
And I ever met more humble people .
And I shared their bread and their prayer .
This is why I went to Afghanistan .
One day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River .
I was alone on foot .
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .
But he gave me a cup of tea .
And I understood that his surprise was my protection .
So I have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from Iran &apos;s border to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor .
And in this way I could find noor , the hidden light of Afghanistan .
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica .
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims , hated by the Taliban .
Hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India .
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears , and welcomed as a gift .
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ?
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen .
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?
Clothed in this nylon bag , made in China , with the name of burqa .
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls &apos; school .
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions .
And their love &#91; for studying &#93; was so big that I cried .
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh ?
The region is not secure , but full of the Taliban , and they did it .
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict .
Thanks .
In October 2010 , the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99 .
Icons like Batman , Superman , Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar , Noora , Jami and their colleagues .
It &apos;s a story of intercultural intersections , and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies ?
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s , an unlikely reaction came out of North America .
As Christian iconography got changed , and swastikas were created out of crucifixes , Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada , also going back to the Bible .
Consider this : like the prophets , all the superheroes are missing parents .
Superman &apos;s parents die on Krypton before the age of one .
Bruce Wayne , who becomes Batman , loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City .
Spiderman is raised And all of them , just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel , get their message from above .
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite .
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head , and he sees it as an omen to become Batman .
Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens , or Krypton , but he &apos;s sent in a pod , much like Moses was on the Nile .
And you hear the voice of his father , Jor-El , saying to Earth , &quot; I have sent to you my only son . &quot;
These are clearly biblical archetypes , and the thinking behind that was to create positive , globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that &apos;s using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message .
And it &apos;s only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked .
This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The 99 .
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about .
It doesn &apos;t matter what your religion is ; even if you &apos;re an atheist , you don &apos;t raise your kid telling him , you know , &quot; Make sure you lie three times a day . &quot;
Those are basic human values .
And so the backstory of The 99 takes place in 1258 , which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it .
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library , the most famous library in its day , were thrown in the Tigris River , and the Tigris changes color with ink .
It &apos;s a story passed on generation after generation .
I rewrote that story , and in my version , the librarians find out that this is going to happen -- and here &apos;s a side note : if you want a comic book to do well , make the librarians the hero . It always works well .
So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution , a chemical solution called King &apos;s Water , that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books .
But the Mongols get there first .
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River .
Some librarians escape , and over the course of days and weeks , they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization .
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of 33 stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain , where they &apos;re safe for 200 years .
But in 1492 , two important things happen .
The first is the fall of Granada , the last Muslim enclave in Europe .
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India , but he gets lost .
So 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina , the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World .
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China , South Asia and Southeast Asia .
And 33 are spread between Europe , the Middle East and Africa .
And now it &apos;s 2010 , and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries .
Now it &apos;s very easy to assume that those books , because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma , were Muslim books , but that &apos;s not the case because the caliph that built that library , his name was al-Ma &apos;mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid &apos;s son .
He had told his advisers , &quot; Get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic , and I will pay them its weight in gold . &quot;
After a while , his advisers complained .
They said , &quot; Your Highness , the scholars are cheating .
They &apos;re writing in big handwriting to take more gold . &quot;
To which he said , &quot; Let them be , because what they &apos;re giving us is worth a lot more than what we &apos;re paying them . &quot;
So the idea of an open architecture , an open knowledge , is not new to my neck of the desert .
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones .
Noor is Arabic for light .
So these 99 stones , a few kind of rules in the game : Number one , you don &apos;t choose the stone ; the stone chooses you .
There &apos;s a King Arthur element to the storyline , okay .
Number two , all of The 99 , when they first get their stone , or their power , abuse it ; they use it for self-interest .
And there &apos;s a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone , you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers , okay .
Number three , the 99 stones all have within them a mechanism that self-updates .
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world .
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place .
Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what &apos;s relevant today .
I don &apos;t belong there .
Then there &apos;s a group that believes the Koran is a living , breathing document , and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update .
Now the main bad guy , Rughal , does not want these stones to update , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop updating .
He can &apos;t use the stones , but he can stop them .
And by stopping them , he has more of a fascist agenda , where he gets some of The 99 to work for him -- they &apos;re all wearing cookie-cutter , same color uniforms They &apos;re not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are .
And he controls them from the top down -- whereas when they work for the other side , eventually , when they find out this is the wrong person , they &apos;ve been manipulated , they actually , each one has a different , colorful kind of dress .
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this .
So The 99 work in teams of three .
Why three ? A couple of reasons .
Number one , we have a thing within Islam that you don &apos;t leave a boy and a girl alone together , because the third person is temptation or the devil , right ?
I think that &apos;s there in all cultures , right ?
But this is not about religion , it &apos;s not about proselytizing .
There &apos;s this very strong social message the deepest crevices of intolerance , and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game .
And so this is the way I dealt with it .
They work in teams of three : two boys and a girl , two girls and a boy , three boys , three girls , no problem .
And the Swiss psychoanalyst , Carl Jung , also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures , so I figure I &apos;m covered .
Well ...
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East , so you -- you believe who you want . I gave you my version of the story .
So here &apos;s some of the characters that we have .
Mujiba , from Malaysia : her main power is she &apos;s able to answer any question .
She &apos;s the Trivial Pursuit queen , if you want , but when she first gets her power , she starts going on game shows and making money .
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .
Now , Mumita was a fun one to name . Mumita is the destroyer .
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang ; there &apos;s the powerful , the hegemonous , the strong , and there &apos;s also the kind , the generous .
I &apos;m like , are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong ?
I &apos;m like , you know what , I &apos;ve met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime , so ...
We have Jami from Hungary , who first starts making weapons : He &apos;s the technology wiz .
Musawwira from Ghana , Hadya from Pakistan , Jaleel from Iran who uses fire .
And this is one of my favorites , Al-Batina from Yemen .
Al-Batina is the hidden .
So Al-Batina is hidden , but she &apos;s a superhero .
I came home to my wife and I said , &quot; I created a character after you . &quot;
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots .
And she said , &quot; Show me . &quot; So I showed this .
She said , &quot; That &apos;s not me . &quot;
I said , &quot; Look at the eyes . They &apos;re your eyes . &quot;
So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production .
This was going to be Superman , or it wasn &apos;t worth my time or their money .
So from day one , the people involved in the project , bottom left is Fabian Nicieza , writer for X-Men and Power Rangers .
Next to him is Dan Panosian , one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men .
Top right is Stuart Moore , a writer for Iron Man .
Next to him is John McCrea , who was an inker for Spiderman .
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline : &quot; Next Ramadan , the world will have new heroes , &quot; back in 2005 .
Now I went to Dubai , to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference , and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist .
Didn &apos;t have a product , but had energy .
And I found somebody from The New York Times , and I cornered him , and I pitched him .
And I think I scared him -- because he basically promised me -- we had no product -- but he said , &quot; We &apos;ll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you &apos;ll just go away . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Great . &quot; So I called him up a few weeks afterward .
I said , &quot; Hi , Hesa . &quot; And he said , &quot; Hi . &quot; I said , &quot; Happy New Year . &quot;
He said , &quot; Thank you . We had a baby . &quot; I said , &quot; Congratulations . &quot;
Like I care , right ?
&quot; So when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Naif , Islam and cartoon ?
That &apos;s not timely .
You know , maybe next week , next month , next year , but , you know , it &apos;ll come out . &quot;
So a few days after that , what happens ?
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy .
I became timely .
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times .
Next thing you knew , there &apos;s a full page covering us positively , January 22nd , 2006 , which changed our lives forever , because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic , guess what they got ; they got me .
And The 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world .
And that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school .
The good news is they &apos;re all holding copies of The 99 , smiling , and they found me to sign the picture .
The bad news is they were all photocopies , so we didn &apos;t make a dime in revenue .
We &apos;ve been able to license The 99 comic books into eight languages so far -- Chinese , Indonesian , Hindi , Urdu , Turkish .
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The 99 Village Theme Park -- 300,000 square feet , 20 rides , all with our characters : a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey .
But the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 26-episode animated series , which is done for global audiences : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey , we know .
It &apos;s 3D CGI , which is going to be very high-quality , written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10 and Spiderman and Star Wars : Clone Wars .
In this clip I &apos;m about to show you , which has never been seen in the public before , there is a struggle .
Two of the characters , Jabbar , the one with the muscles , and Noora , the one that can use light , are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform because they &apos;re being manipulated .
They don &apos;t know , OK , and they &apos;re trying to get another member of The 99 to join them .
So there &apos;s a struggle within the team .
So if we can get the lights ...
&#91; &quot; The 99 &quot; &#93; Jabbar : Dana , I can &apos;t see where to grab hold .
I need more light .
What &apos;s happening ?
Dana : There &apos;s too much darkness .
Rughal : There must be something we can do .
I won &apos;t send any more commandos in until I know it &apos;s safe .
Dr. Razem : It &apos;s time to go , Miklos .
Miklos : Must download file contents .
I can &apos;t forget auntie .
Jabbar : Dana , I can &apos;t do this without you .
Dana : But I can &apos;t help .
Jabbar : You can , even if you don &apos;t believe in yourself right now .
I believe in you .
You are Noora the Light .
Dana : No .
I don &apos;t deserve it . I don &apos;t deserve anything .
Jabbar : Then what about the rest of us ?
Don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? Don &apos;t I ?
Now , tell me which way to go .
Dana : That way .
Alarm : Threat imminent .
Jabbar : Aaaahhh !
Miklos : Stay away from me .
Jabbar : We &apos;re here to help you .
Dr. Razem : Don &apos;t listen to them .
Dana : Miklos , that man is not your friend .
Miklos : No . He gave me access , and you want to reboot the &#91; unclear &#93; . No more &#91; unclear &#93; .
&#91; &quot; The 99 &quot; &#93; Thank you .
So &quot; The 99 &quot; is technology ; it &apos;s entertainment ; it &apos;s design .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
As the father of five sons , I worry about who they &apos;re going to be using as role models .
I worry because all around me , even within my extended family , I see religion being manipulated .
As a psychologist , I worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world .
Now , I &apos;m a clinical psychologist . I &apos;m licensed in New York State .
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program , and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership , only to end up being tortured by their heroes .
And torture &apos;s a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it &apos;s done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
I left Bellevue , went to business school and started this .
Now , one of the things that I refer to when I -- about the importance of this message -- is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University , where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior , and I gave the students two articles , one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine .
And I took away the name of the writer , the name of the &#91; unclear &#93; -- everything was gone except the facts .
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God , who wanted to ban Valentine &apos;s Day . Red was made illegal .
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately , okay .
The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place .
The first one , they said Saudi Arabia . There was no debate .
The second one , they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan .
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India , it was the party of a Hindu God .
The second one took place in upstate New York .
It was an Orthodox Jewish community .
But what breaks my heart and what &apos;s alarming is that in those two interviews , the people around , who were interviewed as well , refer to that behavior as Talibanization .
In other words , good Hindus and good Jews don &apos;t act this way .
This is Islam &apos;s influence on Hinduism and Judaism .
But what do the students in Kuwait say ? They said it &apos;s us -- and this is dangerous .
It &apos;s dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme .
This is one of my sons , Rayan , who &apos;s a Scooby Doo addict .
You can tell by the glasses there .
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day .
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him .
Last summer when we were in our home in New York , he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse . And I was in my office working , and he came in , &quot; Baba , I want you to come with me . I want my toy . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Rayan , just go away . &quot; He left his Scooby Doo in his house .
I said , &quot; Go away . I &apos;m working . I &apos;m busy . &quot;
And what Rayan did then is he sat there , he tapped his foot on the floor , at three and a half , and he looked at me and he said , &quot; Baba , I want you to come with me to my office in my house .
I have work to do . &quot;
Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level .
And with The 99 , that is what we aim to do .
You know , I think that there &apos;s a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas .
And when I see pictures like this , of parents or uncles who think it &apos;s cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something , the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran , that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they &apos;re proud there , to that .
And I think -- I think The 99 can and will achieve its mission .
As an undergrad at Tufts University , we were giving away free falafel one day and , you know , it was Middle East Day or something .
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel , ate it and , you know , talked and left .
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us , &quot; free falafel . &quot; You know .
Or so we thought , until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor , pointed up to the sign and said , &quot; Who &apos;s falafel ? &quot;
True story .
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting .
Just today , D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover .
On that cover you see Batman , Superman and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The 99 , our Emirati member and our Libyan member .
On April 26 , 2010 , President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the Muslim world -- the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out to the Justice League of America .
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols , like the falafel , can be misunderstood because of baggage , and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it &apos;s not supposed to be by others .
In a world like that , they &apos;ll always be a job for Superman and The 99 .
Thank you very much .
Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives , within certain biological limits , is dictated by our genes .
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle .
So the premise of Blue Zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity .
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably couldn &apos;t tell you .
They &apos;ve probably heard of the South Beach Diet , or the Atkins Diet .
You have the USDA food pyramid .
There is what Oprah tells us .
There is what Doctor Oz tells us .
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better .
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga ?
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
When it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
How about these hormones or resveratrol ?
And does purpose play into it ?
Spirituality ? And how about how we socialize ?
Well , our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic , and the National Institute on Aging , to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined .
And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do , to distill down the cross-cultural distillation .
And at the end of this I &apos;m going to tell you what that distillation is .
But first I &apos;d like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity .
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
False .
The problem is , only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100 .
Your chances are very low .
Even though it &apos;s the fastest growing demographic in America , it &apos;s hard to reach 100 .
The problem is that we &apos;re not programmed for longevity .
We are programmed for something called procreative success .
I love that word .
It reminds me of my college days .
Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation , the age when your children have children .
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates .
If you &apos;re a mammal , if you &apos;re a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it &apos;s the same story .
So to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery .
The second myth is , there are treatments that can help slow , reverse , or even stop aging .
False .
When you think of it , there is 99 things that can age us .
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
Play tennis too hard , on your knees , ruin your cartilage , the cartilage never comes back .
Our arteries can clog . Our brains can gunk up with plaque , and we can get Alzheimer &apos;s .
There is just too many things to go wrong .
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells , trillion with a &quot; T. &quot; We &apos;re talking national debt numbers here .
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage . And that damage builds up .
And it builds up exponentially .
It &apos;s a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we &apos;d make a copy of that on a cassette tape , and let our friends copy that cassette tape , and pretty soon , with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage .
Well , the same things happen to our cells .
That &apos;s why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person .
So , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am I doing here ?
Well , the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body , my body , your body , is about 90 years , a little bit more for women .
But life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
So somewhere along the line , we &apos;re leaving about 12 good years on the table .
These are years that we could get .
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them , areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are , areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years , the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country .
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy , on the island of Sardinia .
And not the entire island , the island is about 1.4 million people , but only up in the highlands , an area called the Nuoro province .
And here we have this area where men live the longest , about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America .
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work , chop wood , and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them .
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ .
It &apos;s actually a Bronze Age culture that &apos;s been isolated .
Because the land is so infertile , they largely are shepherds , which occasions regular , low-intensity physical activity .
Their diet is mostly plant-based , accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields .
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .
It &apos;s called Cannonau .
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society .
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people .
You ever notice here in America , social equity seems to peak at about age 24 ?
Just look at the advertisements .
Here in Sardinia , the older you get the more equity you have , the more wisdom you &apos;re celebrated for .
You go into the bars in Sardinia , instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar , you see the centenarian of the month calendar .
This , as it turns out , is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it &apos;s also good for the children of those families , who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease .
That &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet , about 800 miles south of Tokyo , on the archipelago of Okinawa .
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands .
And in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found .
It &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
They have what we want .
They live a long time , and tend to die in their sleep , very quickly , and often , I can tell you , after sex .
They live about seven good years longer than the average American .
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America .
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer , big killers here in America .
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us .
What do they do ?
Once again , a plant-based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them .
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do .
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it .
They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating , which , as you know , is a big problem here in America .
A few of the strategies we observed : they eat off of smaller plates , so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting .
Instead of serving family style , where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you &apos;re talking , they serve at the counter , put the food away , and then bring it to the table .
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage , which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented .
It was invented by Confucius .
And that diet is known as the Hara , Hatchi , Bu diet .
It &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain .
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing .
But , like Sardinia , Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .
We know that isolation kills .
Fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa , you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life .
They call it a Moai . And if you &apos;re in a Moai you &apos;re expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , parent dies , you always have somebody who has your back .
This particular Moai , these five ladies have been together for 97 years .
Their average age is 102 .
Typically in America we &apos;ve divided our adult life up into two sections .
There is our work life , where we &apos;re productive .
And then one day , boom , we retire .
And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to Arizona to play golf .
In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement .
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is &quot; ikigai . &quot;
And , roughly translated , it means &quot; the reason for which you wake up in the morning . &quot;
For this 102-year-old karate master , his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art .
For this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week .
And this is a question . The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians .
And one of the questions , they were very culturally astute , the people who put the questionnaire .
One of the questions was , &quot; What is your ikigai ? &quot;
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
For this 102 year old woman , her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter .
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years .
And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter .
And she put her head back and she said , &quot; It feels like leaping into heaven . &quot;
I thought that was a wonderful thought .
My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America &apos;s Blue Zone .
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota , where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians .
But that &apos;s because all the young people left .
So , we turned to the data again .
And we found America &apos;s longest-lived population among the Seventh-Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda , California .
Adventists are conservative Methodists .
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday .
A &quot; 24-hour sanctuary in time , &quot; they call it .
And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity , comparatively speaking .
In America here , life expectancy for the average woman is 80 .
But for an Adventist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
And the difference is even more pronounced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts .
Now , this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years .
Sterling study . And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project .
This is a heterogeneous community .
It &apos;s white , black , Hispanic , Asian .
The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives .
They take their diet directly from the Bible .
Genesis : Chapter one , Verse &#91; 29 &#93; , where God talks about legumes and seeds , and on one more stanza about green plants , ostensibly missing is meat .
They take this sanctuary in time very serious .
For 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how stressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their God , their social network , and then , hardwired right in the religion , are nature walks .
And the power of this is not that it &apos;s done occasionally , the power is it &apos;s done every week for a lifetime .
None of it &apos;s hard . None of it costs money .
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists .
So , if you go to an Adventist &apos;s party you don &apos;t see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint .
Instead they &apos;re talking about their next nature walk , exchanging recipes , and yes , they pray .
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham .
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old .
He &apos;s a multimillionaire , yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence , he said , &quot; For that kind of money I &apos;ll do it myself . &quot;
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement , and hauling poles around .
And predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
But not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing open-heart surgery .
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month .
Ed Rawlings , 103 years old now , an active cowboy , starts his morning with a swim .
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards , throw up rooster tails .
And then Marge Deton .
Marge is 104 .
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
She starts her day with lifting weights .
She rides her bicycle .
And then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 Cadillac Seville , and tears down the San Bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .
I &apos;ve been on 19 hardcore expeditions .
I &apos;m probably the only person you &apos;ll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen .
But I &apos;ll tell you , there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton .
&quot; A stranger is a friend I haven &apos;t met yet ! &quot; she &apos;d say to me .
So , what are the common denominators in these three cultures ?
What are the things that they all do ?
And we managed to boil it down to nine .
In fact we &apos;ve done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true .
And the first one , and I &apos;m about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise .
Instead , they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity .
These 100-year-old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day .
Sardinians live in vertical houses , up and down the stairs .
Every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend &apos;s house occasions a walk .
They don &apos;t have any conveniences .
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work .
If they want to mix up a cake , they &apos;re doing it by hand .
That &apos;s physical activity .
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does .
When they do do intentional physical activity , it &apos;s the things they enjoy . They tend to walk , the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline , and they all tend to have a garden .
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .
Each of these cultures take time to downshift .
The Sardinians pray . The Seventh-Day Adventists pray .
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration .
But when you &apos;re in a hurry or stressed out , that triggers something called the inflammatory response , which is associated with everything from Alzheimer &apos;s disease to cardiovascular disease .
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state .
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose , ikigai , like the Okinawans .
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you &apos;re born , because of infant mortality , and the year you retire .
These people know their sense of purpose , and they activate in their life , that &apos;s worth about seven years of extra life expectancy .
There &apos;s no longevity diet .
Instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the American population .
They tend to eat a plant-based diet .
Doesn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t eat meat , but lots of beans and nuts .
And they have strategies to keep from overeating , little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect .
They put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community , which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month .
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe .
They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people .
We know from the Framingham studies , that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you &apos;ll be overweight .
So , if you hang out with unhealthy people , that &apos;s going to have a measurable impact over time .
Instead , if your friend &apos;s idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they &apos;re engaged , and they &apos;re trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time .
Diets don &apos;t work . No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .
Exercise programs usually start in January ; they &apos;re usually done by October .
When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
But when you think about it , your friends are long-term adventures , and therefore , perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life , and life to your years . Thank you very much .
Companies are losing control .
What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street .
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube .
Reputations are volatile . Loyalties are fickle .
Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff .
A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm .
However , in the same survey , only four percent of employees agreed .
Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees .
But are they really ?
I &apos;m a marketer , and as a marketer , I know that I &apos;ve never really been in control .
Your brand is what other people say about you when you &apos;re not in the room , the saying goes .
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
They can listen and join the conversation .
In fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
They can design for it . But how ?
First of all , they can give employees and customers more control .
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas , knowledge , content , designs and product .
They can give them more control over pricing , which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album &quot; In Rainbows . &quot; Buyers could determine the price , but the offer was exclusive , and only stood for a limited period of time .
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band .
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so-called &quot; generous store &quot; in Copenhagen .
It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
It turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
Companies can even give control to hackers .
When Microsoft Kinect came out , the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console , it immediately drew the attention of hackers .
Microsoft first fought off the hacks , but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits .
The sense of co-ownership , the free publicity , the added value , all helped drive sales .
The ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones .
In an even more radical stance against consumerism , the company placed a &quot; Don &apos;t Buy This Jacket &quot; advertisement during the peak of shopping season .
It may have jeopardized short-term sales , but it builds lasting , long-term loyalty based on shared values .
Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive .
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries .
Hulu and Netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
Companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
Traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
Giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier .
Take the travel service Nextpedition .
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
It does not tell the traveler where she &apos;s going until the very last minute , and information is provided just in time . Similarly , Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign , seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination .
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day , and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers .
Is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? Yes .
Force them to help others .
A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity .
At Frog , the company I work for , we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees , helping them get to know each other fast .
By applying a strict process , we give them less control , less choice , but we enable more and richer social interactions .
Companies are the makers of their fortunes , and like all of us , they are utterly exposed to serendipity .
That should make them more humble , more vulnerable and more human .
At the end of the day , as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies &apos; behavior in broad daylight , staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition .
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said , &quot; What &apos;s interesting about you is you . &quot;
For the true selves of companies to come through , openness is paramount , but radical openness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
&quot; A smile is a door that is half open and half closed , &quot; the author Jennifer Egan wrote .
Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . They can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
Or they can simply smile , and remain open to all possibilities .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days , talking to groups of students and professionals , and everywhere I &apos;m finding that I hear similar themes .
On the one hand , people say , &quot; The time for change is now . &quot;
They want to be part of it .
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .
But on the other hand , I hear people talking about fear , a sense of risk-aversion .
They say , &quot; I really want to follow a life of purpose , but I don &apos;t know where to start .
I don &apos;t want to disappoint my family or friends . &quot;
I work in global poverty .
And they say , &quot; I want to work in global poverty , but what will it mean about my career ?
Will I be marginalized ?
Will I not make enough money ?
Will I never get married or have children ? &quot;
And as a woman who didn &apos;t get married until I was a lot older -- and I &apos;m glad I waited -- -- and has no children , I look at these young people and I say , &quot; Your job is not to be perfect .
Your job is only to be human .
And nothing important happens in life without a cost . &quot;
These conversations really reflect what &apos;s happening at the national and international level .
Our leaders and ourselves want everything , but we don &apos;t talk about the costs .
We don &apos;t talk about the sacrifice .
One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen , the great American writer from the South .
In a short story called &quot; Oh Yes , &quot; she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl , and she looks at her child with a sense of pride , but she also wonders , what price will she pay ?
&quot; Better immersion than to live untouched . &quot;
But the real question is , what is the cost of not daring ?
What is the cost of not trying ?
I &apos;ve been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion .
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok .
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe , a Native American peoples .
And when we would gather as fellows , she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions .
And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future , looking at them from the Earth , and they would look at them , holding them as stewards for that future .
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other , not only as human beings , but to every living thing on the planet .
And tragically , in 1999 , when she was in Colombia working with the U &apos;wa people , focused on preserving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC .
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that , we would leave a chair empty for her spirit .
And more than a decade later , when I talk to NGO fellows , whether in Trenton , New Jersey or the office of the White House , and we talk about Ingrid , they all say that they &apos;re trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life &apos;s mission .
And when we think about legacy , I can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
And I &apos;ve been touched by Cambodian women -- beautiful women , women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia .
And I met them in the early &apos; 90s .
In the 1970s , under the Pol Pot regime , the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people , and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals , the artists , the dancers .
And at the end of the war , there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living .
And the women , who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors , told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps .
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same .
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage , her hands at her side , and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was .
And these big tears fell down her face , but she never lifted her hands to move them .
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors .
And I thought , after all this atrocity , this is how human beings really pray .
Because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure .
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership .
And I have learned that power , particularly in its absolute form , is an equal opportunity provider .
In 1986 , I moved to Rwanda , and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country &apos;s first microfinance bank .
And one of the women was Agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda , and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda .
We built this institution based on social justice , gender equity , this idea of empowering women .
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end .
And though she had been part of building a liberal party , a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance , about three months before the genocide , she switched parties and joined the extremist party , Hutu Power , and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women .
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide .
And I would visit her in the prisons , sitting side-by-side , knees touching , and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us , but that maybe it &apos;s not monsters so much , but the broken parts of ourselves , sadnesses , secret shame , and that ultimately it &apos;s easy for demagogues to prey on those parts , those fragments , if you will , and to make us look at other beings , human beings , as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme , to do terrible things .
And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men .
I &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .
And so in a gathering where we &apos;re focused on women , while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them , we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered , unable to provide .
And that , when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job , no education , no possibility , well then it &apos;s easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun .
Sometimes very small investments can release enormous , infinite potential that exists in all of us .
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization , Suraj Sudhakar , has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person &apos;s shoes and lead from that perspective .
And he &apos;s been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world , Kibera .
And they &apos;re incredible guys .
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they &apos;re reading many TED authors and liking it .
And then they created a business plan competition .
Then they decided that they would do TEDx &apos;s .
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men .
Alex , in some ways , said it best .
He said , &quot; We used to feel like nobodies , but now we feel like somebodies . &quot;
And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link .
What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other .
And the reason these young guys told me that they &apos;re doing these TEDx &apos;s is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV , or at best , microfinance .
And they wanted to celebrate what &apos;s beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives , the graffiti artists , the teachers and the entrepreneurs .
And they &apos;re doing it .
And my hat &apos;s off to you in Kibera .
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive .
At Acumen Fund , we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity , but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions .
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years , and when we get it back , we invest in other innovations that focus on change .
I know it works .
We &apos;ve invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies , and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets .
This year alone , they &apos;ve delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing , emergency services , solar energy , so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems .
Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t see profit as a blunt instrument .
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit .
And ultimately , we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact , measuring what is most important to us .
And my dream is we &apos;ll have a world one day where we don &apos;t just honor those who take money and make more money from it , but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways .
And it &apos;s only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change .
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence .
I happened to be in Lahore , Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers .
And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don &apos;t believe are fully Muslim .
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hatred , more rage , more fear and certainly despair .
But less than 24 hours , I was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our Acumen investees , an incredible man , Jawad Aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion .
Born and raised in Baltimore , he studied real estate , worked in commercial real estate , and after 9 / 11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference .
For two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend , but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui .
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital , but he continued to pay a price .
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes .
It took almost two years just to register the land .
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person &apos;s action .
Today , 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community .
And there &apos;s schools and clinics and shops .
But there &apos;s only one mosque .
And so I asked Jawad , &quot; How do you guys navigate ? This is a really diverse community .
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Long story .
It was hard , it was a difficult road , but ultimately the leaders of the community came together , realizing we only have each other .
And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams , and those imams would take turns , they would rotate who would say Friday prayer .
But the whole community , all the different sects , including Shi &apos;a and Sunni , would sit together and pray . &quot;
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds .
We face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis , global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness .
And every day we have a choice .
We can take the easier road , the more cynical road , which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was , a fear of each other , distancing and blame .
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation , transcendence , compassion and love , but also accountability and justice .
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles , who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States .
And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges , the first child to desegregate schools in the South -- in this case , New Orleans .
And he said that every day this six-year-old , dressed in her beautiful dress , would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily , calling her a monster , threatening to poison her -- distorted faces .
And every day he would watch her , and it looked like she was talking to the people .
And he would say , &quot; Ruby , what are you saying ? &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;m not talking . &quot;
And finally he said , &quot; Ruby , I see that you &apos;re talking .
What are you saying ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Dr. Coles , I am not talking ; I &apos;m praying . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , what are you praying ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m praying , &apos; Father , forgive them , for they know not what they are doing . &apos; &quot; At age six , this child was living a life of immersion , and her family paid a price for it .
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education .
My final story is about a young , beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga , who was another Acumen Fund fellow , who hails from Uganda , a farming community .
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya , just 200 miles away .
And he said to me at the end of his year , &quot; Jacqueline , it was so humbling , because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture .
But especially when I was talking to the African women , I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen . &quot;
And he said , &quot; So I conclude that , in many ways , leadership is like a panicle of rice .
Because at the height of the season , at the height of its powers , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it nourishes the world , it reaches to the heavens . &quot;
And he said , &quot; But right before the harvest , it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came . &quot;
We need leaders .
We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can , ourselves , extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man , woman and child on this planet .
And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone .
Robert Kennedy once said that &quot; few of us have the greatness to bend history itself , but each of us can work to change a small portion of events . &quot;
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .
Our lives are so short , and our time on this planet is so precious , and all we have is each other .
So may each of you live lives of immersion .
They won &apos;t necessarily be easy lives , but in the end , it is all that will sustain us .
Thank you .
Now , I don &apos;t usually like cartoons , I don &apos;t think many of them are funny , I find them weird . But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker .
So , the guy is telling the cat , don &apos;t you dare think outside the box .
Well , I &apos;m afraid I used to be the cat .
I always wanted to be outside the box .
And it &apos;s partly because I came to this field from a different background , chemist and a bacterial geneticist .
So , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
So , let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it .
So , to begin with , however , I have to give you a very , very quick lesson in developmental biology , with apologies to those of you who know some biology .
So , when your mom and dad met , there is a fertilized egg , that round thing with that little blip .
It grows and then it grows , and then it makes this handsome man .
So , this guy , with all the cells in his body , all have the same genetic information .
So how did his nose become his nose , his elbow his elbow , and why doesn &apos;t he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot ?
It could . It has the genetic information .
You all remember , dolly , it came from a single mammary cell .
So , why doesn &apos;t it do it ?
So , have a guess of how many cells he has in his body .
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body .
Trillion !
Now , how did these cells , all with the same genetic material , make all those tissues ?
And so , the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies .
Now , the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and it would make you a cancer victim .
Well , this did not make sense to me .
Do you even know how a trillion looks ?
Now , let &apos;s look at it .
There it comes , these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes .
Now , if .0001 of these cells got mutated , and .00001 got cancer , you will be a lump of cancer .
You will have cancer all over you . And you &apos;re not .
Why not ?
So , I decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
And let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this .
To begin with , I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken .
Rous discovered this in 1911 .
It was the first cancer virus discovered , and when I call it &quot; oncogene , &quot; meaning &quot; cancer gene . &quot;
So , he made a filtrate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
So , scientists were very excited , and they said , a single oncogene can do it .
All you need is a single oncogene .
So , they put the cells in cultures , chicken cells , dumped the virus on it , and it would pile up , and they would say , this is malignant and this is normal .
And again this didn &apos;t make sense to me .
So for various reasons , we took this oncogene , attached it to a blue marker , and we injected it into the embryos .
Now look at that . There is that beautiful feather in the embryo .
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell , and they &apos;re part of the feather .
So , when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish , we got a mass of blue cells .
So , in the chicken you get a tumor , in the embryo you don &apos;t , you dissociate , you put it in a dish , you get another tumor .
What does that mean ?
That means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do .
Now , let &apos;s take a normal example .
The normal example , let &apos;s take the human mammary gland .
I work on breast cancer .
So , here is a lovely human breast .
And many of you know how it looks , except that inside that breast , there are all these pretty , developing , tree-like structures .
So , we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland , which is called an &quot; acinus , &quot; where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes , and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks .
And we said , wonderful ! Look at this pretty structure .
We want to make this a structure , and ask the question , how do the cells do that ?
So , we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue , other cells that squeeze them , and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert , and it was just having a structure to keep the shape , and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago , and you see this cell is actually quite pretty .
It has a bottom , it has a top , it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk , because it just came from an early pregnant mouse .
You take these cells , you put them in a dish , and within three days , they look like that .
They completely forget .
So you take them out , you put them in a dish , they don &apos;t make milk . They completely forget .
For example , here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left , there is nothing on the right .
Look at the nuclei . The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
They are completely different from each other .
So , what does this tell you ?
This tells you that here also , context overrides .
In different contexts , cells do different things .
But how does context signal ?
So , Einstein said that &quot; For an idea that does not first seem insane , there is no hope . &quot;
So , you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received -- couldn &apos;t get money , couldn &apos;t do a whole lot of other things , but I &apos;m so glad it all worked out .
So , we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse , and all those lovely acini are there , every one of those with the red around them are an acinus , and we said okay , we are going to try and make this , and I said , maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there &apos;s just a structural scaffold , maybe it has information , maybe it tells the cells what to do , maybe it tells the nucleus what to do .
So I said , extracellular matrix , which is this stuff called ECM , signals and actually tells the cells what to do .
So , we decided to make things that would look like that .
We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they got reorganized and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
On the left is what &apos;s inside the animal , we call it in vivo , and the one in culture was full of milk , the lovely red there is full of milk .
So , we Got Milk , for the American audience .
All right . And here is this beautiful human cell , and you can imagine that here also , context goes .
So , what do we do now ?
I made a radical hypothesis .
I said , if it &apos;s true that architecture is dominant , architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it &apos;s normal .
Could this be done ?
So , we tried it .
In order to do that , however , we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant , and on the left is the single normal cell , human breast , put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix , it makes all these beautiful structures .
On the right , you see it looks very ugly , the cells continue to grow , the normal ones stop .
And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor .
So we said , what is on the surface of these ugly tumors ?
Could we calm them down -- they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up -- and make them to the level of the normal ?
Well , it was wonderful . Boggles my mind .
This is what we got .
We can revert the malignant phenotype .
And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn &apos;t just choose one , here are little movies , sort of fuzzy , but you see that on the left are the malignant cells , all of them are malignant , we add one single inhibitor in the beginning , and look what happens , they all look like that .
We inject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tumors .
We inject the other ones in the mouse , 100 percent tumors .
So , it &apos;s a new way of thinking about cancer , it &apos;s a hopeful way of thinking about cancer .
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level , and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment .
All right , thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally .
And here is another five seconds of repose , is my mantra . Form and function .
And of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
We &apos;d like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic .
But before we do that , I &apos;d like you to think that at any given time when you &apos;re sitting there , in your 70 trillion cells , the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus , the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored .
We have made a lot of discoveries , we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin .
We have shown that there &apos;s little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix .
It has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
And before I get to the next slide , I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made .
There is so much mystery we don &apos;t know .
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to , don &apos;t be arrogant , because arrogance kills curiosity .
Curiosity and passion .
You need to always think , what else needs to be discovered ?
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed .
So , we have now made an amazing discovery , a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me , what do the cells do when you put them in ?
What do they do in the beginning when they do ?
I said , I don &apos;t know , we couldn &apos;t look at them .
We didn &apos;t have high images in the old days .
So she , being an imager and a physicist , did this incredible thing .
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions .
Look at it . It &apos;s constantly doing this .
Has a coherent movement .
You put the cancer cells there , and they do go all over , they do this . They don &apos;t do this .
And when we revert the cancer cell , it again does this .
Absolutely boggles my mind .
So the cell acts like an embryo . What an exciting thing .
So I &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
Well I used to love English literature , and I debated in college , which one should I do ?
And unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
But here is a poem from Yeats . I &apos;ll just read you the last two lines .
It &apos;s called &quot; Among the School Children . &quot;
&quot; O body swayed to music / O brightening glance / How &#91; can we know &#93; the dancer from the dance ? &quot;
And here is Merce Cunningham , I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger , and here he is a dancer , and while he is dancing , he is both the dancer and the dance .
The minute he stops , we have neither .
So it &apos;s like form and function .
Now , I &apos;d like to show you a current picture of my group .
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post-docs who have taught me so much , and I have had many of these groups come and go .
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told , don &apos;t think outside the box .
And I &apos;d like to leave you with this thought .
On the left is water coming through the shore , taken from a NASA satellite .
On the right , there is a coral .
Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away , on a dish it looks like that .
Do they look the same ? Do they have the same patterns ?
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again ?
And I &apos;d like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome , we know everything about the sequence of the gene , the language of the gene , the alphabet of the gene , But we know nothing , but nothing , about the language and alphabet of form .
So , it &apos;s a wonderful new horizon , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old , and that &apos;s me .
So go to it !
So I just want to tell you my story .
I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace .
And naturally , I encounter a lot of resistance , because it &apos;s considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning .
But I have a problem with that belief , because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems .
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is .
So I discovered some very interesting things .
For example , there &apos;s no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle .
In the 17th century , a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in Yankee Doodle .
In the 18th century , it became a verb , and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone .
In the 19th century , it was a corrupt politician .
And today , we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition , at least to me , which is the following : To doodle officially means to dawdle , to dilly dally , to monkey around , to make meaningless marks , to do something of little value , substance or import , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing .
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work .
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it &apos;s totally inappropriate .
Additionally , I &apos;ve heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom .
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something .
And unfortunately , the press tends to reinforce this norm when they &apos;re reporting on a doodling scene -- of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like -- they typically use words like &quot; discovered &quot; or &quot; caught &quot; or &quot; found out , &quot; as if there &apos;s some sort of criminal act being committed .
And additionally , there is a psychological aversion to doodling -- thank you , Freud .
In the 1930s , Freud told us all that you could analyze people &apos;s psyches based on their doodles .
This is not accurate , but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was labeled the following things .
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates &apos; doodle .
And Bill , if you &apos;re here , nobody thinks you &apos;re megalomaniacal .
But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles .
And here is the real deal . Here &apos;s what I believe .
I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we &apos;re almost blinded to the value of doodling .
And I &apos;m not comfortable with that .
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst , I &apos;m here to send us all hurtling back to the truth .
And here &apos;s the truth : doodling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn .
So here &apos;s a new definition for doodling .
And I hope there &apos;s someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary , because I want to talk to you later .
Here &apos;s the real definition : Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
That is why millions of people doodle .
Here &apos;s another interesting truth about the doodle : People who doodle when they &apos;re exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts .
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus .
Additionally , it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing .
There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions .
They are visual , auditory , reading and writing and kinesthetic .
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it , we have to engage at least two of those modalities , or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience .
The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience .
That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing .
This is so nerdy , but this made me cry when I discovered this .
So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children , and they found that , across space and time , all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow .
In other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order .
And I think that is incredible .
I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
And finally , a lot a people aren &apos;t privy to this , but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets .
This is but one : this is Frank Gehry the architect &apos;s precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi .
So here is my point : Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room .
On the contrary , doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high .
And I will go you one further .
Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
My friends , the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought .
In reality , it is one of its greatest allies .
Thank you .
Hey guys .
It &apos;s funny , someone just mentioned MacGyver , because that was , like , I loved it , and when I was seven , I taped a fork to a drill and I was like , &quot; Hey , Mom , I &apos;m going to Olive Garden . &quot;
And -- And it worked really well there .
And you know , it had a profound effect on me .
It sounds silly , but I thought , okay , the way the world works can be changed , and it can be changed by me in these small ways .
And my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , I can say they work a different way , a little bit .
And so , about 20 years later , I didn &apos;t realize the full effect of this , but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaym√≠ natives there , and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them , and they could make beds out of trees , and they could -- I watched this woman for three days .
I was there . She was peeling this palm frond apart , these little threads off of it , and she &apos;d roll the threads together and make little thicker threads , like strings , and she would weave the strings together , and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days , the materiality of the way the world works , of reality , kind of started to unravel in my mind , because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener , everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to , maybe a more complicated one , but still , everything was made that way .
And so I had to start studying , who is it that &apos;s making these decisions ?
Who &apos;s making these things ? How did they make them ?
What stops us from making them ?
Because this is how reality is created .
So I started right away . I was at MIT Media Lab , and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity .
And I started in nature , because I saw these Guaym√≠s doing it in nature , and there just seems to be less barriers .
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp , where there &apos;s unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything .
So I said , &quot; Let &apos;s go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together , you know , make something , I don &apos;t care , geometrical shapes , just grab some junk from around you .
We won &apos;t bring anything with us .
And , like , within minutes , this is very easy for adults and teens to do .
Here &apos;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream , and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together .
A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass .
The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
And after about 45 minutes , you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue , so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath .
And the creator of this , he said , &quot; This is fire . I call this fire . &quot;
And someone asked him , &quot; How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree ? &quot;
And he &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t know , but I can show you . &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really amazing .
He doesn &apos;t know , but he can show you . &quot;
So his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially when it comes to the human-made , human-built world .
We think we already know how something works , so we can &apos;t imagine how it could work .
We know how it &apos;s supposed to work , so we can &apos;t suppose all the things that could be possible .
So kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and I saw in my own son , I gave him this book .
I &apos;m a good hippie dad , so I &apos;m like , &quot; Okay , you &apos;re going to learn to love the moon .
I &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re nonrectilinear cactus building blocks , so it &apos;s totally legit . &quot;
But he doesn &apos;t really know what to do with these .
I didn &apos;t show him .
And so he &apos;s like , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll just mess around with this . &quot;
This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest .
Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff .
And before long , he &apos;s kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around , and he enlists us in helping him .
And at this point , I &apos;m starting to wonder , what kind of tools can we give people , especially adults , who know too much , so that they can see the world as malleable , so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives .
Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works , pushing what matter can do , the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium , and any sufficiently complicated task , whether you &apos;re a cook or a carpenter or you &apos;re raising a child -- anything that &apos;s complicated -- comes up with problems that aren &apos;t solved in the middle of it , and you can &apos;t do a good job getting it done unless you can say , &quot; Okay , well we &apos;re just going to have to refigure this .
I don &apos;t care that pencils are supposed to be for writing .
I &apos;m going to use them a different way . &quot;
So let me show you a little demo .
This is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with .
And so , with some ketchup , ‚Äî ‚Äî and then I can kind of ‚Äî ‚Äî And that &apos;s awesome , right ?
But this is not what &apos;s awesome .
What &apos;s awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people .
A pencil is not just a pencil .
Look what it has in the middle of it .
That &apos;s a wire running down the middle , and not only is it a wire , if you take that piano circuit , you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil , and you can lay out wire on the page , too , and get electrical current to run through it .
And so you can kind of hack a pencil , just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit .
And the electricity runs through your body too .
And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil .
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly .
All you do is connect to the bristles , and the bristles are wet , so they conduct , and the person &apos;s body conducts , and leather is great to paint on , and then you can start hooking to everything , even the kitchen sink .
The metal in the sink is conductive .
Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin .
And you can even hook to the trees .
Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive , and you can use those together .
So ‚Äî ‚Äî I took this to those same teens , because those teens are really awesome , and they &apos;ll try things that I won &apos;t try .
I don &apos;t even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to .
And this young woman , she made what she called a hula-looper , and as the hula hoop traveled around her body , she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there .
You can see her pointing to it in the picture .
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body , it would connect two little pieces of copper tape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loop the same sounds over and over again .
I ran these workshops everywhere .
In Taiwan , at an art museum , this 12-year-old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue .
And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it .
And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump , were inviting me to give workshops , just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together .
And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let &apos;s just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
And so I just want to do a quick demo .
So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit , and I &apos;m just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you .
So I &apos;ll just plug it in , and now it &apos;s on by USB .
And I &apos;ll just hook up the forward arrow .
You guys are facing that way , so I &apos;ll hook it to this one .
And I &apos;ll just hook up a little ground wire to it .
And now , if I touch this piece of pizza , the slides that I showed you before should go forward .
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow , I &apos;m kind of programming it by where I hook it up , now I have a left arrow and a right arrow , so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards . Awesome .
And so we &apos;re like , &quot; We gotta put a video out about this . &quot;
Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and , like , one other guy .
So we made a video to prove that there &apos;s lots of stuff you can do .
You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh and just Google for game controllers .
Just ordinary Play-Doh , nothing special .
And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up .
And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target ?
Well , if you take those out , they hold water great , but you can totally cut your toes , so yeah , just be careful .
You know the Happiness Project , where the experts are setting up the piano stairs , and how cool that is ?
Well , I think it &apos;s cool , but we should be doing that stuff ourselves .
It shouldn &apos;t be a set of experts engineering the way the world works .
We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together .
Aluminum foil . Everybody has a cat .
Get a bowl of water . This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS .
Hover the mouse over the &quot; take a photo &quot; button , and you &apos;ve got a little cat photo booth .
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this .
If hundreds of people didn &apos;t buy this , we couldn &apos;t put it on the market .
And so we put it up on Kickstarter , and hundreds of people bought it in the first day .
And then 30 days later , 11,000 people had backed the project .
And then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
So this is &quot; The Star-Spangled Banner &quot; by eating lunch , including drinking Listerine .
And we actually sent this guy materials .
We &apos;re like , &quot; We &apos;re sponsoring you , man .
You &apos;re , like , a pro maker . &quot;
Okay , just wait for this one . This is good .
And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums .
And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
And then this brother -- look at this diagram .
See where it says &quot; sister &quot; ?
I love when people put humans on the diagram .
I always add humans to any technical -- if you &apos;re drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
And this kid is so sweet . He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday , she could be the star of the show , jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides .
And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano .
And this is fun , and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun ?
But it &apos;s also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
Like this dad who wrote us , his son has cerebral palsy and he can &apos;t use a normal keyboard .
And so his dad couldn &apos;t necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers .
And so , with the MaKey MaKey , he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web .
And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we &apos;re really excited about that .
We didn &apos;t plan for that at all .
And then all these professional musicians started using it , like at Coachella , just this weekend Jurassic 5 was using this onstage , and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn , right around here , and he put this up last month .
And I love the carrot on the turntable .
Most people cannot play them that way .
And when this started to get serious , I thought , I &apos;d better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in , because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they &apos;re going to be turning into agents of creative change , and governments will be crumbling , and I wouldn &apos;t have told people , so I thought I &apos;d better warn them .
And I also put this little surprise . When you open the lid of the box , it says , &quot; The world is a construction kit . &quot;
And as you start to mess around this way , I think that , in some small ways , you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with , and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works .
And so next time you &apos;re on an escalator and you drop an M &amp; amp ; M by accident , you know , maybe that &apos;s an M &amp; amp ; M surfboard , not an escalator , so don &apos;t pick it up right away .
Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down , and maybe some chapstick , whatever .
I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that .
But as I &apos;m kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff , I &apos;m realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can &apos;t be designed by one person or even by a million experts .
It &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens .
And that &apos;s the world I really want to live in .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Like the speaker before me , I am -- that &apos;s the TED virgin , I guess -- I &apos;m also the first time here , and I don &apos;t know what to say .
I &apos;m really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me .
I &apos;m really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone .
And the song that I just played was by J√≥zef Hofmann .
It &apos;s called &quot; Kaleidoscope . &quot;
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century , and he &apos;s widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time .
I have another piece that I &apos;d like to play for you .
It &apos;s called &quot; Abegg Variations , &quot; by Robert Schumann , a German 19th century composer .
The name &quot; Abegg &quot; -- &quot; Abegg &quot; is actually A-B-E-G-G , and that &apos;s the main theme in the melody .
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann &apos;s female friends .
But he wrote that for his wife .
So , actually , if you listen carefully , there &apos;s supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme .
It &apos;s written around 1834 , so , even though it &apos;s old , I hope you like it .
Now comes the part that I hate .
Well , because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called &quot; Sync and Flow , &quot; I was wondering , &quot; What do I know that these geniuses don &apos;t ? &quot;
So , I &apos;ll talk about musical composition , even though I don &apos;t know where to start .
How do I compose ?
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose .
What I do first is , I make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme , my main melody , like the Abegg that you just heard .
And once I choose my main theme I have to decide , out of all the styles in music , what kind of style do I want ?
And this year I composed a Romantic style .
So , for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers .
Next , I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers .
They help me plan out the whole piece , and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas , because then you have to think .
And then , when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified , excuse me -- solidified form , you &apos;re supposed to actually polish the piece , polish the details , and then polish the overall performance of the composition .
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing -- drawing , because I like to draw , you know , Japanese anime art .
I think that &apos;s a craze among teens right now .
And once I realized it , there &apos;s a parallel between creating music and creating art , because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing , it &apos;s your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw , or if you want to draw an original character .
And then you want to decide , how are you going to draw the character ?
Like , am I going to use one page ?
Am I going to draw it on the computer ?
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect , I guess ?
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character , which is like your structure of a piece , and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -- that &apos;s polishing the drawing .
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind , because I don &apos;t -- I &apos;m one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted , so if I &apos;m trying to do homework , if I &apos;m trying to do homework and I don &apos;t feel like it , I &apos;ll try to draw or , you know , waste my time .
And then what happens is , sometimes I absolutely can &apos;t draw or I can &apos;t compose at all , and then it &apos;s like there &apos;s too much on your mind .
You can &apos;t focus on what you &apos;re supposed to do .
And sometimes , if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it , you &apos;ll get something out of it , but it doesn &apos;t come naturally .
What happens is , if something magical happens , if something natural happens to you , you &apos;re able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly , and then that &apos;s what I consider &quot; flow , &quot; because that &apos;s when everything clicks and you &apos;re able to do anything .
You feel like you &apos;re on top of your game and you can do anything you want .
I &apos;m not going to play my own composition today because , although I did finish it , it &apos;s way too long .
Instead , I &apos;d like to try something called &quot; improvisation . &quot;
I have here seven note cards , one with each note of the musical alphabet , and I &apos;d like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I &apos;ll improvise it .
Wow , a volunteer , yay !
Nice to meet you .
Goldie Hawn : Thank you . Choose five ?
Jennifer Lin : Yes , five cards . Any five cards .
GH : OK . One . Two . Three .
Oh , D and F -- too familiar .
JL : One more .
GH : OK , E for effort .
JL : Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them ?
GH : OK . C , G , B , A and E.
JL : Thank you very much .
GH : You &apos;re welcome . And what about these ?
JL : I won &apos;t use them . Thank you .
Now , she chose C , G , B , A , E.
I &apos;m going to try to put that in some sort of order .
OK , that &apos;s nice .
So , I &apos;m going to have a moment to think , and I &apos;ll try to make something out of it .
The next song , or the encore , that I &apos;m going to play is called &quot; Bumble Boogie , &quot; by Jack Fina .
When I graduated UCLA , I moved to northern California , and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast , and I didn &apos;t have a phone or TV , but I had U.S. mail , and life was good back then , if you could remember it .
I &apos;d go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie , and I &apos;d ship my film to San Francisco , and lo and behold , two days later , it would end up on my front door , which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood .
I didn &apos;t have much money , but I had time and a sense of wonder .
So I started shooting time-lapse photography .
It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute roll of film , because that &apos;s all I could afford .
I &apos;ve been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously , non-stop , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for over 30 years , and to see them move is a dance I &apos;ll never get tired of .
Their beauty immerses us with color , taste , touch .
It also provides a third of the food we eat .
Beauty and seduction is nature &apos;s tools for survival , because we protect what we fall in love with .
It opens our hearts , and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we &apos;re not separate from it .
When we see ourselves in nature , it also connects us to every one of us , because it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s all connected in one .
When people see my images , a lot of times they &apos;ll say , &quot; Oh my God . &quot; Have you ever wondered what that meant ?
The &quot; oh &quot; means it caught your attention , makes you present , makes you mindful .
The &quot; my &quot; means it connects with something deep inside your soul .
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard . And &quot; God &quot; ?
God is that personal journey we all want to be on , to be inspired , to feel like we &apos;re connected to a universe that celebrates life .
Did you know that 80 percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes ?
And if you compare light energy to musical scales , it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
And aren &apos;t we grateful for our brains that can , you know , take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world ?
And aren &apos;t we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature ?
Nature &apos;s beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude .
So I have a gift I want to share with you today , a project I &apos;m working on called Happiness Revealed , and it &apos;ll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world .
When I watch TV , it &apos;s just some shows that you just -- that are pretend , and when you explore , you get more imagination than you already had , and when you get more imagination , it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things , like the path , if it &apos;s a path , it could lead you to a beach , or something , and it could be beautiful .
You think this is just another day in your life ?
It &apos;s not just another day . It &apos;s the one day that is given to you today .
It &apos;s given to you . It &apos;s a gift .
It &apos;s the only gift that you have right now , and the only appropriate response is gratefulness .
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is , if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day , then you will have spent this day very well .
Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open , that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment .
Look at the sky .
We so rarely look at the sky .
We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
We just think of the weather , and even with the weather , we don &apos;t think of all the many nuances of weather .
We just think of good weather and bad weather .
This day , right now , has unique weather , maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again .
That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same as it is right now .
Open your eyes . Look at that .
Look at the faces of people whom you meet .
Each one has an incredible story behind their face , a story that you could never fully fathom , not only their own story , but the story of their ancestors .
We all go back so far , and in this present moment , on this day , all the people you meet , all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life-giving water , if you only open your heart and drink .
Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us .
You flip a switch and there is electric light .
You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water , and drinkable water .
It &apos;s a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience .
So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart .
And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings , and let them flow through you , that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you , just by your eyes , by your smile , by your touch , just by your presence .
Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you , and then it will really be a good day .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . Everything has been said .
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here , and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away , and take forward and work on .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to try and do .
We came here saying we want to talk about &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter . &quot;
But we are talking about &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter &quot; because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we &apos;re looking at , and saying it &apos;s not such a good thing .
The picture I showed you before , and this picture , of drought , death and disease is what we usually see .
What we want to look at is &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s this : a healthy , smiling , beautiful African .
And I think it &apos;s worth remembering what we &apos;ve heard through the conference right from the first day , where I heard that all the important statistics have been given -- about where we are now , about how the continent is doing much better .
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
So I &apos;m not going to spend too much time -- just to show you , refresh your memories that we are here for &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter &quot; because for the first time there really is a platform to build on .
We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen .
After decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it &apos;s going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
And inflation has come down .
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .
You know , as you can see , from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion .
Now this is a huge achievement .
You know , we &apos;ve built up reserves . Why is that important ?
It &apos;s because it shows off our economies , shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build , including businesses .
We &apos;ve also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased .
I want to remind you again -- I know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
In 2005 , remittances -- I just took one country , Nigeria skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic , but increasing dramatically .
And in many other countries this is happening .
Why is this important ? Because it shows confidence .
People are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
And instead of an outflow , you are now getting a net inflow .
Now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
It &apos;s important that we build this platform , that we have the president , Kikwete , and others of our leaders who are saying , &quot; Look , we must do something different . &quot;
Because we are confronted with a challenge .
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24 .
What does this mean ?
This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives .
You have to focus on how to create jobs , make sure they don &apos;t fall into disease , and that they get an education .
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen .
And to support this , I just recently -- one of the things I &apos;ve done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria .
Most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
People don &apos;t have voice .
There is no way you can know what people want .
One of the things we asked them recently was what &apos;s their top issue .
Like in every other country where this has been done , jobs is the top issue .
I want to leave this up here and come back to it .
But before I get to this slide , I just wanted to run you through this .
And to say that for me , the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward -- and we mustn &apos;t make light of it .
It was only 5 , 6 , 7 years ago we couldn &apos;t even talk about the next chapter , because we were in the old chapter .
We were going nowhere .
The economies were not growing .
We were having negative per capita growth .
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there .
So let &apos;s not forget that it &apos;s taken a lot to build this , including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to .
Creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy .
So now we have this platform we can build on .
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here : aid versus private sector , aid versus trade , etc .
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it &apos;s been a simplistic debate .
And that &apos;s not what the debate should be about .
That &apos;s engaging in the wrong debate .
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors , the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives ?
How do we combine all this ?
To move our continent forward , to do the things that need doing that I talked about -- getting young people employed .
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent , much of what you have seen here .
So I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .
We need to bring it back to say , what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want ?
And I want to tell you something .
For me , the issue about aid -- I don &apos;t think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
Africa has been giving the other countries aid .
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid .
And I said , &quot; Mo , you &apos;re right . We have -- no , but we &apos;ve already been doing it !
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa &apos;s aid . &quot;
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa , including human , that built these countries today !
So when they try to give back , we shouldn &apos;t be on the defensive .
The issue is not that .
The issue is how are we using what has been given back .
How are we using it ?
Is it being directed effectively ?
I want to tell you a little story .
Why I don &apos;t mind if we get aid , but we use it well .
From 1967 to &apos; 70 , Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war .
And in the middle of that war , I was 14 years old .
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking .
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army .
We were on the Biafran side .
And we were down to eating one meal a day , running from place to place , but wherever we could help we did .
At a certain point in time , in 1969 , things were really bad .
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day .
People , children were dying of kwashiorkor .
I &apos;m sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures .
Well , I was in the middle of it .
In the midst of all this , my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days .
We thought she was going to die .
My father was not there .
He was in the army .
So I was the oldest person in the house .
My sister fell very ill with malaria .
She was three years old and I was 15 .
And she had such a high fever . We tried everything .
It didn &apos;t look like it was going to work .
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them meds .
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back .
It was really hot . I was very hungry .
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman .
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people .
I walked 10 kilometers , putting one foot in front of the other .
I got there and I saw huge crowds .
Almost a thousand people were there , trying to break down the door .
She was doing this in a church . How was I going to get in ?
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back , find a way to a window .
And while they were trying to break down the door , I climbed in through the window , and jumped in .
This woman told me it was in the nick of time .
By the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving .
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies , and put us in a corner .
In about two to three hours , she started to move .
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating , which was a good sign .
And then my sister woke up .
And about five or six hours later , she said we could go home .
I strapped her on my back .
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had .
I was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive !
Today she &apos;s 41 years old , a mother of three , and she &apos;s a physician saving other lives .
Why am I telling that ? I &apos;m telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don &apos;t care where -- whether it &apos;s aid .
You don &apos;t care what it is !
You just want the person to be alive !
And now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contributing productively into the economy .
And as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
These are people who are productive agents in the economy .
So if we save people from HIV / AIDS , if we save them from malaria , it means they can form the base of production for our economy .
And by the same token -- as someone said yesterday -- if we don &apos;t and they die , their children will become a burden on the economy .
So even from an economic standpoint , if we leave the social and the humanitarian , we need to save lives now .
So that &apos;s one of the reasons , from a personal experience , that I say let &apos;s channel these resources we get into something productive .
However , I will also tell you that I &apos;m one of those who doesn &apos;t believe that this is the sole answer .
That &apos;s why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated .
You know , we have to use it well .
What has happened in Europe ?
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU ?
Resources that were transferred to them -- and were the Spanish ashamed of this ? No !
The EU transferred 10 billion . Where did they use it ?
Have you been to southern Spain lately ? There are roads everywhere .
Infrastructure everywhere .
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy .
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ?
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today .
For which many people , even from other parts of the world , are going there to find jobs .
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid ?
They used it to build an information superhighway , gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution , and to create jobs in their economy .
They didn &apos;t say , &quot; No , you know , we &apos;re not going to take this . &quot;
Today , the European Union is busy transferring aid .
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain -- which is roads , highways , other things that they can build -- I say then , why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries ?
When we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now .
Now we talk about the World Bank , IMF , and accountability , all that and the EU .
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience , with private foundations .
And one day , these foundations have so much money , they will overtake the official aid that is being given .
But I fear -- and I &apos;m very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -- but I &apos;m also worried . I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent .
And they &apos;re also going from country to country , and many times trying to find what to do .
But I &apos;m not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way .
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent .
They are just discovering .
And many times I don &apos;t see Africans working with them .
They are just going alone !
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know .
They want to visit us , see what &apos;s happening on the ground and make a decision .
And now I &apos;m maybe being harsh .
But I worry because this money is so important .
Now , who are they accountable to ?
Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money ? Are we there ?
Will we make the same mistake that we made before ?
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said , &quot; Look , your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money , we are grateful .
Let &apos;s sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go . &quot;
Have we done that ? The answer is no .
And each one is making their own individual effort .
And then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into Africa , and we would still have the same problems .
This is what gives us the hopeless image .
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; Sit down . &quot;
And we don &apos;t do it because there are so many of us . We don &apos;t coordinate .
We &apos;ve not called the Bill Gates , and the Soros , and everybody else who is helping and say , &quot; Sit down . Let &apos;s have a conference with you .
As a continent , here are our priorities .
Here is where we want you to channel this money . &quot;
Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
We &apos;re not trying to stop them at all ! But to help them help us better .
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this .
Ten years from now we will have the same story , and we will be repeating the same things .
So our problem right now is , how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way ?
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations , with the international organizations , and with our private sector .
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too .
But it cannot do it alone .
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work .
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas .
So why don &apos;t we think of using some of this aid ?
Well , why don &apos;t we first say to those helping us out , &quot; Don &apos;t be shy about infrastructure .
That health that you &apos;re working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure .
That education will work better if we &apos;ve got electricity and railroads , and so on .
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
Don &apos;t be shy of it .
Invest some of your resources in that , too . &quot;
And then we can see that this is one combination of private , international , multilateral money , private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership , so that aid can be a facilitator .
That is all aid can be .
Aid cannot solve our problems , I &apos;m firmly convinced about that .
But it can be catalytic . And if we fail to use it as catalytic , we would have failed .
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that , you know , these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources .
It &apos;s because there &apos;s a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese .
If you tell them , &quot; We need a road here , &quot; they will help you build it .
They don &apos;t shy away from infrastructure .
In fact , the Chinese minister of finance said to me , when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria .
He said , &quot; There are two things you need only .
Infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline .
You are undisciplined . &quot;
And I repeat it for the continent .
It &apos;s the same . We need infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline .
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that .
Now I realize -- I &apos;m not saying -- health and education -- no , you can also provide that as well .
But I &apos;m saying it &apos;s not either or .
Let &apos;s see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership .
One idea .
Second thing , for the private sector , people are afraid to take risks on the continent .
Why can &apos;t some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms , to enable people to take risk ?
And finally , because they are both standing at my -- I &apos;m out of time .
Am I out of time ?
OK , so let me not forget my punchline .
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women , to create jobs .
A lot has been said here about women , I don &apos;t need to repeat it .
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
And we know , studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact , there &apos;s an econometric study , the World Bank Review , done in 2000 , showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children , more for the household , more for the economy and all that .
So I &apos;m saying that one of the takeaways from here -- I &apos;m not saying the men are not important -- obviously , if you leave the husbands out , what will they do ?
They &apos;ll come back home and get disgruntled , and it will result in difficulties we don &apos;t want .
We don &apos;t want men beating their wives because they don &apos;t have a job , and so on .
But at the margin , we also -- I want to push this , because the reason is the men automatically -- they get -- not automatically , but they tend to get more support .
But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool .
There are people creating jobs .
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda .
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria , with the chair company .
She wants to expand .
She needs another 20 million .
She will create another 100 , 200 more jobs .
So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs .
And lastly , what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid , government , private sector and the African as an individual ?
Thank you .
Well , it &apos;s great to be here .
We &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
I &apos;ve been quite interested in both .
If we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy , we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030 .
We can &apos;t do that today because solar panels are heavy , expensive and very inefficient .
There are nano-engineered designs , which at least have been analyzed theoretically , that show the potential to be very lightweight , very inexpensive , very efficient , and we &apos;d be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way .
Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it &apos;s needed .
That &apos;s a key trend , which is decentralization , moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly , a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption .
Bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction .
In 1990 , in East Asia and the Pacific region , there were 500 million people living in poverty -- that number now is under 200 million .
The World Bank projects by 2011 , it will be under 20 million , which is a reduction of 95 percent .
I did enjoy Bono &apos;s comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley .
Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself , I &apos;d point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s , although we hung around Harvard Square .
But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and I &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology .
That &apos;s been a strong interest of mine , and a theme that I &apos;ve developed for some 30 years .
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project .
That invariably , the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology .
And , I noticed that most inventions fail , not because the R &amp; amp ; D department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the timing is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends , and track where technology would be at different points in time , and began to build the mathematical models of that .
It &apos;s kind of taken on a life of its own .
I &apos;ve got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas , and we build models .
And you &apos;ll hear people say , well , we can &apos;t predict the future .
And if you ask me , will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that &apos;s very hard to say .
Will WiMax CDMA G3 be the wireless standard three years from now ? That &apos;s hard to say .
But if you ask me , what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012 , or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance , capacity , bandwidth .
And I &apos;m going to show you a small sample of this , but there &apos;s really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion .
And a lot of people , when they think about the future , think about it linearly .
They think they &apos;re going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today &apos;s tools , at today &apos;s pace of progress , and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth .
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990 .
We had our best Ph.D. students , our most advanced equipment around the world , we got 1 / 10,000th of the project done , so how &apos;re we going to get this done in 15 years ?
And 10 years into the project , the skeptics were still going strong -- says , &quot; You &apos;re two-thirds through this project , and you &apos;ve managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome . &quot;
But it &apos;s the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve , it explodes .
Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project .
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days .
So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems .
I &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is .
The actual paradigm-shift rate , the rate of adopting new ideas , is doubling every decade , according to our models .
These are all logarithmic graphs , so as you go up the levels it represents , generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100 .
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone , the first virtual-reality technology .
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years .
If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
Recent technologies -- like the PC , the web , cell phones -- were under a decade .
Now this is an interesting chart , and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes -- accelerate .
They work through interaction -- they create a capability , and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage .
So the first step in biological evolution , the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first -- took billions of years , but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage .
So the Cambrian Explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . It was 200 times faster .
And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions , and biological evolution kept accelerating .
It &apos;s an inherent nature of an evolutionary process .
So Homo sapiens , the first technology-creating species , the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way , chimpanzees don &apos;t really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination , and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology .
But anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage , which were the first steps in technological evolution .
And the first step took tens of thousands of years -- stone tools , fire , the wheel -- kept accelerating .
We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation .
Printing press took a century to be adopted ; the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers .
And we &apos;ve had a continual acceleration of this process .
Now by the way , if you look at this on a linear graph , it looks like everything has just happened , but some observer says , &quot; Well , Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line . &quot;
So , I took 15 different lists from key thinkers , like the Encyclopedia Britannica , the Museum of Natural History , Carl Sagan &apos;s Cosmic Calendar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point ; these were just lists in reference works , and I think that &apos;s what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution .
And again , it forms the same straight line . You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements , what the key points are , there &apos;s differences of opinion when agriculture started , or how long the Cambrian Explosion took .
But you see a very clear trend .
There &apos;s a basic , profound acceleration of this evolutionary process .
Information technologies double their capacity , price performance , bandwidth , every year .
And that &apos;s a very profound explosion of exponential growth .
A personal experience , when I was at MIT -- computer taking up about the size of this room , less powerful than the computer in your cell phone .
But Moore &apos;s Law , which is very often identified with this exponential growth , is just one example of many , because it &apos;s basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology .
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph -- by the way , a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth -- that &apos;s another exponential .
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 , two years in the middle ; we &apos;re now doubling it every one year .
And that &apos;s exponential growth through five different paradigms .
Moore &apos;s Law was just the last part of that , where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit , but we had electro-mechanical calculators , relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code , vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower , discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore &apos;s Law .
Every time one paradigm ran out of steam , another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth .
They were shrinking vacuum tubes , making them smaller and smaller .
That hit a wall . They couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork .
In fact , when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm , it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm .
And because we &apos;ve been predicting the end of Moore &apos;s Law for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002 , until now it says 2022 .
But by the teen years , the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width , and we won &apos;t be able to shrink them any more .
That &apos;ll be the end of Moore &apos;s Law , but it won &apos;t be the end of the exponential growth of computing , because chips are flat .
We live in a three-dimensional world ; we might as well use the third dimension .
We will go into the third dimension and there &apos;s been tremendous progress , just in the last few years , of getting three-dimensional , self-organizing molecular circuits to work .
We &apos;ll have those ready well before Moore &apos;s Law runs out of steam .
Supercomputers -- same thing .
Processor performance on Intel chips , the average price of a transistor -- 1968 , you could buy one transistor for a dollar .
You could buy 10 million in 2002 .
It &apos;s pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is .
I mean , you &apos;d think this is the result of some tabletop experiment , but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products , IPOs , bankruptcies , marketing programs .
You would think it would be a very erratic process , and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .
Just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do -- it &apos;s hopeless to predict a single molecule -- yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using thermodynamics , very accurately .
It &apos;s the same thing here . We can &apos;t predict any particular project , but the result of this whole worldwide , chaotic , unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable .
And we can predict these trends far into the future .
Unlike Gertrude Stein &apos;s roses , it &apos;s not the case that a transistor is a transistor .
As we make them smaller and less expensive , the electrons have less distance to travel .
They &apos;re faster , so you &apos;ve got exponential growth in the speed of transistors , so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years .
You add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
And that &apos;s basically deflation -- 50 percent deflation .
And it &apos;s not just computers . I mean , it &apos;s true of DNA sequencing ; it &apos;s true of brain scanning ; it &apos;s true of the World Wide Web . I mean , anything that we can quantify , we have hundreds of different measurements of different , information-related measurements -- capacity , adoption rates -- and they basically double every 12 , 13 , 15 months , depending on what you &apos;re looking at .
In terms of price performance , that &apos;s a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate .
And economists have actually started worrying about that .
We had deflation during the Depression , but that was collapse of the money supply , collapse of consumer confidence , a completely different phenomena .
This is due to greater productivity , but the economist says , &quot; But there &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to be able to keep up with that .
If you have 50 percent deflation , people may increase their volume 30 , 40 percent , but they won &apos;t keep up with it . &quot;
But what we &apos;re actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it .
We &apos;ve had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years .
I mean , people didn &apos;t build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago .
As the price performance makes new applications feasible , new applications come to the market .
And this is a very widespread phenomena .
Magnetic data storage -- that &apos;s not Moore &apos;s Law , it &apos;s shrinking magnetic spots , different engineers , different companies , same exponential process .
A key revolution is that we &apos;re understanding our own biology in these information terms .
We &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
These were evolved in very different times -- we &apos;d like to actually change those programs .
One little software program , called the fat insulin receptor gene , basically says , &quot; Hold onto every calorie , because the next hunting season may not work out so well . &quot;
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago .
We &apos;d like to actually turn that program off .
They tried that in animals , and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim .
They didn &apos;t get diabetes ; they didn &apos;t get heart disease ; they lived 20 percent longer ; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction .
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this , felt that would be interesting drug for the human market , and that &apos;s just one of the 30,000 genes that affect our biochemistry .
We were evolved in an era where it wasn &apos;t in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference , like myself , to live much longer , because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them .
So , life -- long lifespans -- like , that is to say , much more than 30 -- weren &apos;t selected for , but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution .
For example , we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference .
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome .
There &apos;s actually a -- for the first time now , something going to human trials , that actually cures pulmonary hypertension -- a fatal disease -- using gene therapy .
So we &apos;ll have not just designer babies , but designer baby boomers .
And this technology is also accelerating .
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990 , then a penny in 2000 .
It &apos;s now under a 10th of a cent .
The amount of genetic data -- basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year , enabling the genome project to be completed .
Another major revolution : the communications revolution .
The price performance , bandwidth , capacity of communications measured many different ways ; wired , wireless is growing exponentially .
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways .
This is based on the number of hosts .
Miniaturization -- we &apos;re shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate , both wired and wireless .
These are some designs from Eric Drexler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations , where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots .
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait , that &apos;s built out of molecules .
There are little machines doing things in experimental bases .
The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
And this is less futuristic than it may sound .
These things have already been done in animals .
There &apos;s one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes . It &apos;s blood cell-sized .
They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion , and actually cures type 1 diabetes .
What you &apos;re watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell , and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal , even though it &apos;s remarkable in its intricacy .
Once we understand its principles of operation , and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating , we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .
An analysis of this respirocyte , designed by Rob Freitas , indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions , you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath .
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so , &quot; Honey , I &apos;m in the pool , &quot; will take on a whole new meaning .
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials .
Presumably we &apos;ll ban them , but then we &apos;ll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes .
Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell .
These are 2020-circa scenarios , but they &apos;re not as futuristic as it may sound .
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices ; there are many experiments in animals .
There &apos;s actually one going into human trial , so this is feasible technology .
If we come back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain .
It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s , but that &apos;ll be the hardware side of the equation .
Where will we get the software ?
Well , it turns out we can see inside the human brain , and in fact not surprisingly , the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
And with the new generation of scanning tools , for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time -- but then the question is , OK , we can get this data now , but can we understand it ?
Doug Hofstadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
It turns out that we can understand it .
This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well -- in applying psychoacoustic tests , gets very similar results to human auditory perception .
There &apos;s another simulation of the cerebellum -- that &apos;s more than half the neurons in the brain -- again , works very similarly to human skill formation .
This is at an early stage , but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning , we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s .
We &apos;ve already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred .
All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress .
We &apos;ve had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years .
E-commerce has been growing exponentially . It &apos;s now a trillion dollars .
You might wonder , well , wasn &apos;t there a boom and a bust ?
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena .
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology , which it was , but then six months later , when it hadn &apos;t revolutionized all business models , they figured , well , that was wrong , and then we had this bust .
All right , this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we &apos;re involved in .
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone .
It would be able to translate from one language to another .
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
By 2010 computers will disappear .
They &apos;ll be so small , they &apos;ll be embedded in our clothing , in our environment .
Images will be written directly to our retina , providing full-immersion virtual reality , augmented real reality . We &apos;ll be interacting with virtual personalities .
But if we go to 2029 , we really have the full maturity of these trends , and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology , which are getting faster and faster , we &apos;ll have at that point .
I mean , we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance , capacity and bandwidth of these technologies , which is pretty phenomenal .
It &apos;ll be millions of times more powerful than it is today .
We &apos;ll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain , 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity .
Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior , in terms of doing analytic thinking , remembering billions of facts accurately .
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly .
But it &apos;s not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines .
We are going to merge with our technology .
These nano-bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications : cleaning up the environment , providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment .
But they &apos;ll also go inside our brain , interact with our biological neurons .
We &apos;ve demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this .
So , for example , full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system , the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses , replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment , and then it &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re in that virtual environment .
You can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .
&quot; Experience beamers , &quot; I call them , will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet .
You can plug in and experience what it &apos;s like to be someone else .
But most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology .
Human life expectancy is expanding . It was 37 in 1800 , and with this sort of biotechnology , nano-technology revolutions , this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead .
My main message is that progress in technology is exponential , not linear .
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model , so they &apos;ll say , &quot; Oh , it &apos;ll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence . &quot;
If you really look at the power of exponential growth , you &apos;ll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives , from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials .
We &apos;ll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s , from information , in very inexpensive raw materials , using nano-technology .
These are very powerful technologies .
They both empower our promise and our peril .
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
Thank you very much .
There &apos;s a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the 19th century .
It was said to echo in Churchill &apos;s brain in the 1930s .
And the poem goes : &quot; On the idle hill of summer , lazy with the flow of streams , hark I hear a distant drummer , drumming like a sound in dreams , far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by , dear to friend and food to powder , soldiers marching , soon to die . &quot;
Those who are interested in poetry , the poem is &quot; A Shropshire Lad &quot; written by A.E. Housman .
But what Housman understood , and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too , was that the long , hot , silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes .
And these are always periods , ladies and gentlemen , accompanied by turbulence , and all too often by blood .
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned , if you like , to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world , the new powers that exist in the world , are beginning to take form .
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times , highly difficult times , and all too often very bloody times .
By the way , it happens about once every century .
You might argue that the last time it happened -- and that &apos;s what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations , the old powers of Europe , across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America -- the beginning of the American century .
And of course , into the vacuum where the too-old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part : the two great World Wars .
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate way of describing them .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , we live at one of those times .
But for us , I want to talk about three factors today .
And the first of these , the first two of these , is about a shift in power .
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
But let &apos;s talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world .
And what is happening today is , in one sense , frightening because it &apos;s never happened before .
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .
It &apos;s also moving vertically .
What &apos;s happening today is that the power that was encased , held to accountability , held to the rule of law , within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage .
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it &apos;s the globalization of real power .
And where , at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not .
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides : the power of the Internet , the power of the satellite broadcasters , the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it &apos;s supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers , if you like , the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently , the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries .
These live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment .
It &apos;s always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint , but the lesson of history is that , sooner or later , unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated , not just by the things you wanted -- international trade , the Internet , etc . -- but also by the things you don &apos;t want -- international criminality , international terrorism .
The revelation of 9 / 11 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth , nevertheless , those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning .
It &apos;s said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9 / 11 actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which 9 / 11 destroyed .
You see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways .
Sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
And if it is therefore the case , as I believe it is , that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power , then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space .
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim : to bring governance to the global space .
Now notice , I &apos;m not talking about government .
I &apos;m not talking about setting up some global democratic institution .
My own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions .
If we didn &apos;t have the U.N. , we &apos;d have to invent it .
The world needs an international forum .
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action .
But when it comes to governance of the global space , my guess is this won &apos;t happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions .
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems , treaty-based agreements , to govern that global space .
And if you look , you can see them happening , already beginning to emerge .
The World Trade Organization : treaty-based organization , entirely treaty-based , and yet , powerful enough to hold even the most powerful , the United States , to account if necessary .
Kyoto : the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization .
The G20 : we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation .
And that &apos;s what the G20 is , a treaty-based institution .
Now there &apos;s a problem there , and we &apos;ll come back to it in a minute , which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions , to fill that governance space , then what happens to the weak who are left out ?
And that &apos;s a big problem , and we &apos;ll return to it in just a second .
So there &apos;s my first message , that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently , then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space .
And watch that beginning to happen .
My second point is , and I know I don &apos;t have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing , but power is not just shifting vertically , it &apos;s also shifting horizontally .
You might argue that the story , the history of civilizations , has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean , the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic .
Well it seems to me that we &apos;re now seeing a fundamental shift of power , broadly speaking , away from nations gathered around the Atlantic &#91; seaboard &#93; to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim .
Now that begins with economic power , but that &apos;s the way it always begins .
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies , the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world .
I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East ; something different is happening .
My guess is , for what it &apos;s worth , is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years , 15 , but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ; it has radically changed .
We are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus .
But that &apos;s not a usual case in history .
In fact , what &apos;s now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
You &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
Up until now , the United States has been the dominant feature of our world .
They will remain the most powerful nation , but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world .
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China , of course , though my own guess is that China &apos;s ascent to greatness is not smooth .
It &apos;s going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy .
But that &apos;s a subject of a different discussion .
You see India , you see Brazil .
You see increasingly that the world now looks actually , for us Europeans , much more like Europe in the 19th century .
Europe in the 19th century : a great British foreign secretary , Lord Canning , used to describe it as the &quot; European concert of powers . &quot;
There was a balance , a five-sided balance .
Britain always played to the balance .
If Paris got together with Berlin , Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance .
Now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances -- NATO , the Warsaw Pact .
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances .
And that &apos;s the world we &apos;re coming into , in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed .
Canning , the great British foreign secretary once said , &quot; Britain has a common interest , but no common allies . &quot;
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out , have to reach out , beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world .
Note , that when we went into Libya , it was not good enough for the West to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
We had to bring , in this case , the Arab League in .
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves , and we haven &apos;t succeeded .
My guess is that we &apos;re reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it &apos;s the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power , Western institutions and Western values .
You know , up until now , if the West got its act together , it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world .
But that &apos;s no longer true .
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War .
The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution , World Bank , International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved .
Now we have to call in others .
Now we have to create the G20 .
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends .
Let me make a prediction for you , which is probably even more startling .
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough .
People say to me , &quot; The Chinese , of course , they &apos;ll never get themselves involved in peace-making , multilateral peace-making around the world . &quot;
Oh yes ? Why not ?
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret , serving under the blue flag , serving under the U.N. command in the world today ?
3,700 .
How many Americans ? 11 .
What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates ?
The Chinese naval contingent .
Of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
They want to keep the sea lanes open .
Increasingly , we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values , but with whom , for the moment , we share common interests .
It &apos;s a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging .
And here &apos;s the third factor , which is totally different .
Today in our modern world , because of the Internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
We are now interdependent .
We are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
The interrelationship of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations .
But now we are intimately locked together .
You get swine flu in Mexico , it &apos;s a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later .
Lehman Brothers goes down , the whole lot collapses .
There are fires in the steppes of Russia , food riots in Africa .
We are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a viable proposition .
Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself , nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory , because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them .
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain .
At that time , the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only : how strong was our army , how strong was our air force , how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies .
That was when the enemy was outside the walls .
Now the enemy is inside the walls .
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country , I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country , who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7 / 7 bombings .
It &apos;s no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense .
It &apos;s its capacity to lock together its institutions .
And this tells you something very important .
It tells you that , in fact , our governments , vertically constructed , constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy , specialization of tasks , command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely .
You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time , ladies and gentlemen , is the network .
It &apos;s your capacity to network that matters , both within your governments and externally .
So here is Ashdown &apos;s third law .
By the way , don &apos;t ask me about Ashdown &apos;s first law and second law because I haven &apos;t invented those yet ; it always sounds better if there &apos;s a third law , doesn &apos;t it ?
Ashdown &apos;s third law is that in the modern age , where everything is connected to everything , the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others .
The most important bit about your structure -- whether you &apos;re a government , whether you &apos;re an army regiment , whether you &apos;re a business -- is your docking points , your interconnectors , your capacity to network with others .
You understand that in industry ; governments don &apos;t .
But now one final thing .
If it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it &apos;s also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
Suddenly and for the very first time , collective defense , the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations , is no longer enough .
It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe , I was safe ; if my country was more powerful than their country , I was safe ; my alliance , like NATO , was more powerful than their alliance , I was safe .
It is no longer the case .
The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that , increasingly , I share a destiny with my enemy .
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s , we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them .
Collective security is not enough .
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn &apos;t work .
They shared a destiny with their enemies .
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides , both Israel and , I think , the Palestinians , do not understand that they share a collective destiny .
And so suddenly , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .
I started with a poem , I &apos;ll end with one .
The great poem of John Donne &apos;s .
&quot; Send not for whom the bell tolls . &quot;
The poem is called &quot; No Man is an Island . &quot;
And it goes : &quot; Every man &apos;s death affected me , for I am involved in mankind , send not to ask for whom the bell tolls , it tolls for thee . &quot;
For John Donne , a recommendation of morality .
For us , I think , part of the equation for our survival .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation .
All right . Are you with me ? Yeah . Yeah . All right .
So what I &apos;d like to do is have you raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex .
Could be the neighbors , hotel room , your parents . Sorry .
Okay . Pretty much everybody .
Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman .
I see one guy there .
It doesn &apos;t count if it was you , sir .
So his hand &apos;s down . And one woman . Okay .
Sitting next to a loud guy .
Now what does this tell us ?
It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex , and it &apos;s generally the woman who makes more noise .
This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd .
I wasn &apos;t even going to mention this , but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here , and she is the world &apos;s most famous female copulatory vocalizer .
So I thought , got to talk about that .
We &apos;ll get back to that a little bit later .
Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes , despite what you may have heard . We are apes .
We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant , as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
We &apos;re more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas , orangutans , what have you .
So we &apos;re extremely closely related to them , and as you &apos;ll see in terms of our behavior , we &apos;ve got some relationship as well .
So what I &apos;m asking today , the question I want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
Now , since Darwin &apos;s day there &apos;s been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution , and you &apos;re all familiar with it , even if you haven &apos;t read this stuff .
The idea is that , as part of human nature , from the beginning of our species &apos; time , men have sort of leased women &apos;s reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services .
Generally we &apos;re talking about meat , shelter , status , protection , things like that .
And in exchange , women have offered fidelity , or at least a promise of fidelity .
Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship .
The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA , according to this vision . Right ?
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no , this economic relationship , this oppositional relationship , is actually an artifact of agriculture , which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest .
Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years , so we &apos;re talking about five percent , at most , of our time as a modern , distinct species .
So before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
They not only share things , they demand that things be shared : meat , shelter , protection , all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity , it turns out , are shared widely among these societies .
Now I &apos;m not saying that our ancestors were noble savages , and I &apos;m not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either .
What I &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
And there &apos;s really no argument about this among anthropologists .
All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality .
So we &apos;ve argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved , until agriculture , as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex , flexible social systems , networks , that our ancestors were very good at , and that &apos;s why our species has survived so well .
Now , this makes some people uncomfortable , and so I always need to take a moment in these talks to say , listen , I &apos;m saying our ancestors were promiscuous , but I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
There were no strangers . Right ?
In a hunter-gatherer band , there are no strangers .
You &apos;ve known these people your entire life .
So I &apos;m saying , yes , there were overlapping sexual relationships , that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives .
But I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
I &apos;m not saying that they didn &apos;t love the people they were having sex with .
And I &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
I &apos;m just saying it wasn &apos;t sexually exclusive .
And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous -- my parents , for example , have been married for 52 years monogamously , and if it wasn &apos;t monogamously , Mom and Dad , I don &apos;t want to hear about it ‚Äî I &apos;m not criticizing this and I &apos;m not saying there &apos;s anything wrong with this .
What I &apos;m saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism .
You can choose to be a vegetarian , but don &apos;t think that just because you &apos;ve made that decision , bacon suddenly stops smelling good .
Okay ? So this is my point .
That one took a minute to sink in , huh ?
Now , in addition to being a great genius , a wonderful man , a wonderful husband , a wonderful father , Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude .
All right ? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates , including chimps and bonobos , because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females .
So he couldn &apos;t understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond , right ?
Chimps and bonobos , Darwin didn &apos;t really know this , but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings .
Interestingly , chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent , roughly , of their menstrual cycle , bonobos 90 percent , and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle , whether she &apos;s menstruating , whether she &apos;s post-menopausal , whether she &apos;s already pregnant .
This is vanishingly rare among mammals .
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
Now , Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day , as scientists tend to do sometimes .
So what we &apos;re talking about is sperm competition .
Now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells , so it &apos;s already a competitive environment .
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men &apos;s sperm or just their own .
There &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
The one thing I &apos;ll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human .
That indicates female copulatory vocalization .
Just look at the numbers .
The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth .
If that number seems high for some of you , I assure you it seems low for others in the room .
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos .
We don &apos;t share it with the other three apes , the gorilla , the orangutan and the gibbon , who are more typical of mammals , having sex only about a dozen times per birth .
Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive .
And you &apos;ll see that the human , chimp and bonobo all have external testicles , which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer .
If you &apos;re the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage , you expect a party to happen at any moment , and you need to be ready .
That &apos;s what the external testicles are .
They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
The human , some of you will be happy to hear , has the largest , thickest penis of any primate .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
It goes into anthropology as well .
Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution .
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China .
In their society , everyone , men and women , are completely sexually autonomous .
There &apos;s no shame associated with sexual behavior .
Women have hundreds of partners .
It doesn &apos;t matter . Nobody cares . Nobody gossips . It &apos;s not an issue .
When the woman becomes pregnant , the child is cared for by her , her sisters , and her brothers .
The biological father is a nonissue .
On the other side of the planet , in the Amazon , we &apos;ve got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity .
These people actually believe -- and they have no contact among them , no common language or anything , so it &apos;s not an idea that spread , it &apos;s an idea that &apos;s arisen around the world -- they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen .
So a woman who wants to have a child who &apos;s smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy , the funny guy and the strong guy , to get the essence of each of these men into the baby , and then when the child is born , these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child .
So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society .
So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book .
Now , why does this matter ?
Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation .
I think that &apos;s true . This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world .
The contradictions between what we &apos;re told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering .
My hope is that a more accurate , updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves , for each other , greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions , and that we &apos;ll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate , instinctive right to monitor and control women &apos;s sexual behavior .
Thank you .
And we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s not only gay people that have to come out of the closet .
We all have closets we have to come out of . Right ?
And when we do come out of those closets , we &apos;ll recognize that our fight is not with each other , our fight is with an outdated , Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights , generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy .
It &apos;s time we moved beyond Mars and Venus , because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa .
Thank you .
Thank you . Christopher Ryan : Thank you .
So a question .
It &apos;s so perplexing , trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today .
Someone could give a talk and say , look at us , we &apos;ve got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that &apos;s really good at throwing weapons , and if you look at lots of societies around the world , you &apos;ll see very high rates of violence .
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism , but it &apos;s not who you are .
How is that different from the talk you gave ?
CR : Well first of all , the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable .
But that &apos;s just an example .
Certainly , you know , lots of people say to me , just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn &apos;t mean we should live that way now , and I agree with that .
Everyone has to respond to the modern world .
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories .
And so you could live on McDonald &apos;s and milkshakes , but your body will rebel against that . We have appetites .
I think it was Schopenhauer who said , a person can do what they want but not want what they want .
And so what I &apos;m arguing against is the shame that &apos;s associated with desires .
It &apos;s the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people , there &apos;s something wrong with you , there &apos;s something wrong with your marriage , something wrong with your partner .
I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
Thank you . Communicated powerfully . Thanks a lot .
CR : Thank you , Chris .
I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in Facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents , I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital , but I was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , I did the only thing I could think of at the time .
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . I left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the U.N. , everywhere .
I blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and I posed a kind of crazy promise to the Internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , I would write you one , no questions asked .
Overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in Sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural Kansas , all asking me , a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox .
Well , today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they &apos;re ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
But , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper .
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters .
They &apos;re the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook , and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less .
But what if it &apos;s not about efficiency this time ?
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you .
If you ever need one , just carry one of these .
And a man just stared at me , and he was like , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you use the Internet ? &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Well , sir , I am not a strategist , nor am I specialist . I am merely a storyteller . &quot;
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan , and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation , and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say , &quot; Come back to me .
Find me when you can . &quot;
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque , Iowa , only to find her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees , tucked in the bushes and the benches .
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
Well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now , all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins .
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we &apos;ve got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of &quot; get faster , &quot; no matter how many social networks we might join .
We still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
Thank you .
I teach chemistry .
All right , all right .
So more than just explosions , chemistry is everywhere .
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over ?
Some people nodding yes .
Recently , I showed this to my students , and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating .
Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening .
Now obviously , as Maddie &apos;s chemistry teacher , I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie &apos;s curiosity took her to a new level .
If you look inside that beaker , you might see a candle .
Maddie &apos;s using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario .
You know , questions and curiosity like Maddie &apos;s are magnets that draw us towards our teachers , and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education .
But if we place these technologies before student inquiry , we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers : our students &apos; questions .
For example , flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time , but if it is the focus of our students &apos; experience , it &apos;s the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing .
But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students , perplex them , and evoke real questions , through those questions , we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction .
So , 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside , the truth is , I &apos;ve been teaching for 13 years now , and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning , not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information .
In May of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way , I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta .
This led to open-heart surgery . This is the actual real email from my doctor right there .
Now , when I got this , I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out , okay ?
But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied .
Where did this guy get this confidence , the audacity of it ?
So when I asked him , he told me three things .
He said first , his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what didn &apos;t work .
Second , he embraced , and didn &apos;t fear , the messy process of trial and error , the inevitable process of trial and error .
And third , through intense reflection , he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure , and then , with a steady hand , he saved my life .
Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom , and before I went back into the classroom that fall , I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today .
Rule number one : Curiosity comes first .
Questions can be windows to great instruction , but not the other way around .
Rule number two : Embrace the mess .
We &apos;re all teachers . We know learning is ugly .
And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip , okay , trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206 .
And rule number three : Practice reflection .
What we do is important . It deserves our care , but it also deserves our revision .
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
As if what we are doing one day will save lives .
Our students our worth it .
And each case is different .
All right . Sorry .
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on .
So these are my daughters .
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family .
And , on the left , Riley .
Now Riley &apos;s going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here .
She &apos;s going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Yeah . Why .
I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything .
We all were at that age .
But the challenge is really for Riley &apos;s future teachers , the ones she has yet to meet .
How will they grow this curiosity ?
You see , I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids , and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms -- to the senior who &apos;s checked out before the year &apos;s even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school &apos;s classroom .
But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry , we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day , and spark their imagination .
Thank you very much .
If you think about the phone -- and Intel has tested a lot of the things I &apos;m going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in Ireland , and 300 in Portland -- trying to understand : How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way ?
And if you think about the phone , right , it &apos;s something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time .
We &apos;re testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it &apos;s our system whispering to them which pill they need to take , and they fake like they &apos;re having a conversation with a friend .
And they &apos;re not embarrassed by a meds caddy that &apos;s ugly , that sits on their kitchen table and says , &quot; I &apos;m old . I &apos;m frail . &quot;
It &apos;s surreptitious technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
Now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones .
Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
Think about it , all right ? I &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
&quot; Hello ? Hey . &quot;
All right ? That &apos;s the first time .
&quot; Hello ? Uh , hey . &quot;
&quot; Hello ? Uh , who ?
Oh , hey . &quot;
All right ? Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times .
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time , down to the tenths of a microsecond , that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately , or they do a lot of what &apos;s called trouble talk , where they &apos;re like , &quot; Wait , who is this ? Oh . &quot; Right ?
Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
We call these behavioral markers .
There &apos;s lots of others . Is the person going to the phone as quickly , when it rings , as they used to ?
Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem ?
Has their voice gotten more quiet ? We &apos;re doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer &apos;s and particularly with Parkinson &apos;s , where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson &apos;s patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson &apos;s five to 10 years before it shows up clinically .
But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
So , sensors are looking at that kind of voice .
When you pick up the phone , how much tremor are you having , and what is that like , and what is that trend like over a period of time ?
Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to ?
Is it a dexterity problem ? Is it the onset of arthritis ?
Are you using the phone ? Are you socializing less than you used to ?
And looking at that pattern . And what does that decline in social health mean , as a kind of a vital sign of the future ?
And then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the United States -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .
Wow , what a great day that will be once we &apos;re allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
So , these are what I would call behavioral markers .
And it &apos;s the whole field that we &apos;ve been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
How do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that I &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
Behavioral markers matter .
How do we change behavior ?
How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that &apos;s going to help us with prevention of disease , early onset of disease , and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time ?
Now , why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money , over the last 10 years , trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers ?
This is some of the field work that we &apos;ve done .
We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
We study people in Rochester , New York .
We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter , and their access to healthcare , and how much they socialize , is very different than in the summer .
If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well .
So , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
Why is Intel willing to fund that ?
It &apos;s because of the second slogan that I want to talk about .
Ten years ago , when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living , this is what I called it : &quot; Y2K + 10 . &quot;
You know , back in 2000 , we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers , and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000 , that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to .
It was right around New Years .
And that switchover , when we had the larger number of older people on the planet , for the first time than younger people .
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic , that &apos;s the expectation from demographers , going forward .
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this . Right ?
Y2K + 10 was coming , the baby boomers starting to retire .
Well folks , it &apos;s like we know these demographics here .
This is a map of the entire world .
It &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic Y2K + 10 problem . Right ?
I mean we sort of get it here , but we don &apos;t get it here , and we &apos;re not doing anything about it .
The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that &apos;s coming , and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care , but deliver care in some radically different ways .
And in fact , it &apos;s upon us .
I mean you probably saw these headlines . This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security .
That actually occurred this year . She took early retirement .
She was born one second after midnight in 1946 .
A retired school teacher , there she is with a Social Security administrator .
The first boomer actually , we didn &apos;t even wait till 2011 , next year .
We &apos;re already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
All right , so it &apos;s here . This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door .
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar , but somehow we can &apos;t sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it . We &apos;ll wait until it &apos;s more of a catastrophe , and react , as opposed to prepare for it .
So , one of the reasons it &apos;s so challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem is , I want to argue , we have what I would call mainframe poisoning .
Andy Grove , about six or seven years ago , he doesn &apos;t even know or remember this , in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase &quot; mainframe healthcare , &quot; and I &apos;ve been extending and expanding this .
He saw it written down somewhere . He &apos;s like , &quot; Eric that &apos;s a really cool concept . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Actually it was your idea . You said it in a Fortune Magazine article .
I just extended it . &quot;
You know , this is the mainframe .
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large , expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .
This is the first general hospital in Vienna .
And actually the second general hospital in Vienna , in about 1850 , was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties .
And it &apos;s a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body , and divided care into departments and compartments .
And it was reflected in our architecture , it was reflected in the way that we taught students , and this mainframe mentality persists today .
Now , I &apos;m not anti-hospital .
With my own healthcare problems , I &apos;ve taken drug therapies , I &apos;ve traveled to this hospital and others , many , many times .
But we worship the high hospital on a hill . Right ?
And this is mainframe healthcare .
And just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
We are obsessed with this way of thinking .
When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say , &quot; Quick response : healthcare . &quot;
The first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
The second that comes up is &quot; hospital . &quot; And the third is &quot; illness &quot; or &quot; sickness . &quot; Right ?
We are wired , in our imagination , to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place .
Our entire health reform discussion right now , health I.T. , when we talk with policy makers , equals &quot; How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? &quot;
We &apos;re not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home .
And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare . Right ?
This is a very reactive , crisis-driven system .
We &apos;re doing 15-minute exams with patients .
It &apos;s population-based .
We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting , and we fix them up , like Humpty-Dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope -- we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don &apos;t come back into the mainframe .
And the problem is we can &apos;t afford it today , folks .
We can &apos;t afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured .
And now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through ?
Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we &apos;ve got to do something different .
We &apos;ve got to focus on the home .
We &apos;ve got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home . How do we be more proactive , prevention-driven ?
How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7 ?
How do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data , psychological data , relational data , in and on and around the home ?
And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that &apos;s around us to change our behavior ?
That &apos;s what we need to do for our personal health model .
I want to give you a couple of examples . This is Mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s , had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls .
Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . Right ?
Classic . Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior .
This is what was happening to Mimi ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility .
She tripped over her oxygen tank .
Many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don &apos;t want to bother anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
Boomers will press the button . Trust me .
They &apos;re going to be pressing that button non-stop . Right ?
Mimi broke her pelvis , lay all night , all morning , finally somebody came in and found her , sent her to the hospital .
They fixed her back up . She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living . They put her into the nursing home unit .
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on Tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
Now , the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife &apos;s grandmother .
Now , I &apos;m Eric Dishman . I speak English , I work for Intel , I make a good salary , I &apos;m smart about falls and fall-related injuries -- it &apos;s an area of research that I work on .
I have access to senators and CEOs .
I can &apos;t stop this from happening .
What happens if you don &apos;t have money , you don &apos;t speak English or don &apos;t have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur ?
How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place ?
Let me give you a quick example of work that we &apos;re doing to try to do exactly that .
I &apos;ve been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer .
It &apos;s a research platform .
It has accelerometry . You can plug in a three-lead ECG .
There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of Legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
The problem is , our understanding of falls today , like Mimi , is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell , from the State , saying , &quot; What were you doing when you fell ? &quot;
That &apos;s sort of the state of the art .
But with something like Shimmer , or we have something called the Magic Carpet , embedded sensors in carpet , or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine , we &apos;re starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand : What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls ?
And most often we can do two interventions , fix the meds mix .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher , but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes , I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the household . Right ?
These discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of -- actually what you &apos;re seeing is she &apos;s looking at data , in this picture , from the Magic Carpet .
So , we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway , and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months .
Here &apos;s what some of this data might look like .
This is actually sensor firings .
These are two different subjects in our study .
It &apos;s about a year &apos;s worth of data .
The color represents different rooms they are in the house .
This person on the left is living in their own home .
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility .
I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here . Right ?
Now , this doesn &apos;t mean that much to you .
But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we &apos;re looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we &apos;ve never understood before .
You can go to ORCATech.org -- it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology -- to see more about that .
The problem is , Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research .
I &apos;m not bragging about how much we fund ; it &apos;s how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging , chronic disease management and independent living in the home .
So , my mantra here , my fourth slogan is : 10,000 households or bust .
We need to drive a national , if not international , Framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies , where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband , full medical characterization , and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund , to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies .
So , 10,000 households or bust .
These are just some of the households that we &apos;ve done in the Intel studies .
My fifth and final phrase : I have tried for two years , and there were moments when we were quite close , to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something , from a mainframe model to a personal health model , or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we &apos;re going to finance .
It doesn &apos;t matter how we finance healthcare .
We &apos;re going to figure something out for the next 10 years , and try it .
No matter who pays for it , we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways .
The president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , &quot; Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot;
It &apos;s achievable . We should do it economically , we should do it morally , and we should do it for quality of life .
But there is no goal within this health reform .
It &apos;s just a mess today .
So , you know , that &apos;s my last message to you .
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K + 10 problem that &apos;s coming ?
It &apos;s not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all , but it &apos;s going to be part of the solution .
And if we don &apos;t create a personal health movement , something that we &apos;re all aiming towards in reform , then we &apos;re going to move nowhere .
So , I hope you &apos;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
Thanks very much .
Good morning .
I &apos;m here today to talk about autonomous , flying beach balls .
No , agile aerial robots like this one .
I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology .
So these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles .
However , the vehicles you see here are big .
They weigh thousands of pounds , are not by any means agile .
They &apos;re not even autonomous .
In fact , many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots , operators of sensors and mission coordinators .
What we &apos;re interested in is developing robots like this -- and here are two other pictures -- of robots that you can buy off the shelf .
So these are helicopters with four rotors and they &apos;re roughly a meter or so in scale and weigh several pounds .
And so we retrofit these with sensors and processors , and these robots can fly indoors without GPS .
The robot I &apos;m holding in my hand is this one , and it &apos;s been created by two students , Alex and Daniel .
So this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound .
It consumes about 15 watts of power .
And as you can see , it &apos;s about eight inches in diameter .
So let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work .
So it has four rotors .
If you spin these rotors at the same speed , the robot hovers .
If you increase the speed of each of these rotors , then the robot flies up , it accelerates up .
Of course , if the robot were tilted , inclined to the horizontal , then it would accelerate in this direction .
So to get it to tilt , there &apos;s one of two ways of doing it .
So in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower .
And when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll .
And the other way around , if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one , then the robot pitches forward .
And then finally , if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair , then the robot yaws about the vertical axis .
So an on-board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions and figures out what commands to send to the motors 600 times a second .
That &apos;s basically how this thing operates .
So one of the advantages of this design is , when you scale things down , the robot naturally becomes agile .
So here R is the characteristic length of the robot .
It &apos;s actually half the diameter .
And there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce R.
The one that &apos;s the most important is the inertia or the resistance to motion .
So it turns out , the inertia , which governs angular motion , scales as a fifth power of R.
So the smaller you make R , the more dramatically the inertia reduces .
So as a result , the angular acceleration , denoted by Greek letter alpha here , goes as one over R.
It &apos;s inversely proportional to R.
The smaller you make it the more quickly you can turn .
So this should be clear in these videos .
At the bottom right you see a robot performing a 360 degree flip in less than half a second .
Multiple flips , a little more time .
So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board and calculating , like I said before , commands at 600 times a second to stabilize this robot .
So on the left , you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air .
And it shows you how robust the control is .
No matter how you throw it , the robot recovers and comes back to him .
So why build robots like this ?
Well robots like this have many applications .
You can send them inside buildings like this as first responders to look for intruders , maybe look for biochemical leaks , gaseous leaks .
You can also use them for applications like construction .
So here are robots carrying beams , columns and assembling cube-like structures .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more about this .
The robots can be used for transporting cargo .
So one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .
This is a picture of a recent experiment we did -- actually not so recent anymore -- in Sendai shortly after the earthquake .
So robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings to assess the damage after natural disasters , or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels .
So one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they &apos;re to be autonomous is essentially figuring out how to get from point A to point B.
So this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated .
In fact , they live in a 12-dimensional space .
So we use a little trick .
We take this curved 12-dimensional space and transform it into a flat four-dimensional space .
And that four-dimensional space consists of X , Y , Z and then the yaw angle .
And so what the robot does is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory .
So to remind you of physics , you have position , derivative , velocity , then acceleration , and then comes jerk and then comes snap .
So this robot minimizes snap .
So what that effectively does is produces a smooth and graceful motion .
And it does that avoiding obstacles .
So these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated 12-dimensional space , which the robot must do for control and then execution .
So let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like .
And in the first video , you &apos;ll see the robot going from point A to point B through an intermediate point .
So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory .
So these are circular trajectories where the robot pulls about two G &apos;s .
Here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is 100 times a second .
It also tells the robot where these obstacles are .
And the obstacles can be moving .
And here you &apos;ll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air , while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop .
So as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre-programmed .
So here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers .
So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot .
So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum , and then does this pirouette , this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers , this robot is basically doing that .
So it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks .
So I want change gears .
So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size .
And I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size .
So one difficulty is how do you coordinate lots of these robots ?
And so here we looked to nature .
So I want to show you a clip of Aphaenogaster desert ants in Professor Stephen Pratt &apos;s lab carrying an object .
So this is actually a piece of fig .
Actually you take any object coated with fig juice and the ants will carry them back to the nest .
So these ants don &apos;t have any central coordinator .
They sense their neighbors .
There &apos;s no explicit communication .
But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object , they have implicit coordination across the group .
So this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have .
So when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors -- and let &apos;s look at robot I and robot J -- what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly in formation .
And then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels .
So again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands 100 times a second , which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second .
So this also has to be done in a decentralized way .
Again , if you have lots and lots of robots , it &apos;s impossible to coordinate all this information centrally fast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task .
Plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information , what they sense from their neighbors .
And then finally , we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are .
So this is what we call anonymity .
So what I want to show you next is a video of 20 of these little robots flying in formation .
They &apos;re monitoring their neighbors &apos; position .
They &apos;re maintaining formation .
The formations can change .
They can be planar formations , they can be three-dimensional formations .
As you can see here , they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .
And to fly through obstacles they can adapt the formations on the fly .
So again , these robots come really close together .
As you can see in this figure-eight flight , they come within inches of each other .
And despite the aerodynamic interactions of these propeller blades , they &apos;re able to maintain stable flight .
So once you know how to fly in formation , you can actually pick up objects cooperatively .
So this just shows that we can double , triple , quadruple the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighbors , as you can see here .
One of the disadvantages of doing that is , as you scale things up -- so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing , you &apos;re essentially effectively increasing the inertia , and therefore you pay a price ; they &apos;re not as agile .
But you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity .
Another application I want to show you -- again , this is in our lab .
This is work done by Quentin Lindsey who &apos;s a graduate student .
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .
So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up , when and where to place it .
So in this video you see -- and it &apos;s sped up 10 , 14 times -- you see three different structures being built by these robots .
And again , everything is autonomous , and all Quentin has to do is to get them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build .
So all these experiments you &apos;ve seen thus far , all these demonstrations , have been done with the help of motion capture systems .
So what happens when you leave your lab and you go outside into the real world ?
And what if there &apos;s no GPS ?
So this robot is actually equipped with a camera and a laser rangefinder , laser scanner .
And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment .
What that map consists of are features -- like doorways , windows , people , furniture -- and it then figures out where its position is with respect to the features .
So there is no global coordinate system .
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot , where it is and what it &apos;s looking at .
And it navigates with respect to those features .
So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
So the robot then figures out what the features are .
It builds the map .
It figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier .
So this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank .
But the robot can also figure out where to go on its own .
So suppose I were to send this into a building and I had no idea what this building looked like , I can ask this robot to go in , create a map and then come back and tell me what the building looks like .
So here , the robot is not only solving the problem , how to go from point A to point B in this map , but it &apos;s figuring out what the best point B is at every time .
So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information .
And that &apos;s how it populates this map .
So I want to leave you with one last application .
And there are many applications of this technology .
I &apos;m a professor , and we &apos;re passionate about education .
Robots like this can really change the way we do K through 12 education .
But we &apos;re in Southern California , close to Los Angeles , so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment .
I want to conclude with a music video .
I want to introduce the creators , Alex and Daniel , who created this video .
So before I play this video , I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days after getting a call from Chris .
And the robots that play the video are completely autonomous .
You will see nine robots play six different instruments .
And of course , it &apos;s made exclusively for TED 2012 .
Let &apos;s watch .
The Highline is an old , elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan .
And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave .
And it became known as &quot; Death Avenue &quot; because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front , and he became known as the &quot; West Side Cowboy . &quot;
But even with a cowboy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
So they elevated it .
They built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
But with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
And by 1980 , the last train rode .
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say , at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district .
And then it was abandoned .
And I live in the neighborhood , and I first read about it in the New York Times , in an article that said it was going to be demolished .
And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer , but I realized no one was doing anything .
I went to my first community board meeting -- which I &apos;d never been to one before -- and sat next to another guy named Joshua David , who &apos;s a travel writer .
And at the end of the meeting , we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project ; most people wanted to tear it down .
So we exchanged business cards , and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization , Friends of the High Line .
And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition , but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it .
And what first attracted me , or interested me , was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure , sort of rusty , this industrial relic .
But when I went up on top , it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River .
And that &apos;s really where we started , the idea coalesced around , let &apos;s make this a park , and let &apos;s have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape .
At the time , there was a lot of opposition .
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down .
I &apos;m going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement .
Mayor Bloomberg came in office , he was very supportive , but we still had to make the economic case .
This was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case .
And it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
So far it &apos;s cost about 150 million .
And the main case was , this is going to make good economic sense for the city .
So we said over a 20-year time period , the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million .
That was enough . It really got the city behind it .
It turns out we were wrong on that .
Now people estimate it &apos;s created about a half a billion dollars , or will create about a half a billion dollars , in tax revenues for the city .
We did a design competition , selected a design team .
We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape .
There &apos;s three sections .
We opened the fist section in 2009 .
It &apos;s been successful beyond our dreams .
Last year we had about two million people , which is about 10 times what we ever estimated .
This is one of my favorite features in section one .
It &apos;s this amphitheater right over 10th Ave .
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now .
The other thing , it &apos;s generated , obviously , a lot of economic value ; it &apos;s also inspired , I think , a lot of great architecture .
There &apos;s a point , you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry , Jean Nouvel , Shigeru Ban , Neil Denari .
And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano .
And they &apos;re going to break ground in May .
And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
This is one of my favorite features , this flyover where you &apos;re eight feet off the surface of the High Line , running through a canopy of trees .
The High Line used to be covered in billboards , and so we &apos;ve taken a playful take where , instead of framing advertisements , it &apos;s going to frame people in views of the city .
This was just installed last month .
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards , which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan .
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around .
But what really , I think , makes the High Line special is the people .
And honestly , even though I love the designs that we were building , I was always frightened that I wouldn &apos;t really love it , because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic ?
But what I found is it &apos;s in the people and how they use it that , to me , makes it so special .
Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line .
And I realized New Yorkers don &apos;t hold hands ; we just don &apos;t do that outside .
But you see that happening on the High Line , and I think that &apos;s the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other .
Thanks .
Good morning .
Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces .
I have a very peculiar background , attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer .
Now , I prefer that term over magician , because if I were a magician , that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic .
No , I don &apos;t do that ; I &apos;m a conjurer , who is someone who pretends to be a real magician .
Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
We depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .
For example , when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on , you assumed this was a microphone , which it is not .
As a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
It &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
And it makes a very bad microphone ; I &apos;ve tried it many times .
The other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
Not only that you can , but that you will when they are properly suggested to you .
You believe I &apos;m looking at you .
Wrong . I &apos;m not looking at you . I can &apos;t see you .
I know you &apos;re out there , they told me backstage , it &apos;s a full house and such .
I know you &apos;re there because I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you because I normally wear glasses .
These are not glasses , these are empty frames .
Quite empty frames .
Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face ?
To fool you , ladies and gentlemen , to deceive you , to show that you , too , can make assumptions .
Don &apos;t you ever forget that .
Now , I have to do something -- first of all , switch to real glasses so I can actually see you , which would probably be a convenience . I don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t had a good look . Well , it &apos;s not that great a convenience .
I have to do something now , which seems a little bit strange for a magician .
But I &apos;m going to take some medication .
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
Ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , I &apos;m sure .
I will take enough of these . Mm .
Indeed , the whole container .
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte .
Now that I &apos;ve done that -- I &apos;ll explain it in a moment -- I must tell you that I am an actor .
I &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
I play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet , you would be insulted and rightly so .
Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this ?
But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the deceased .
Oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .
Oh , they gladly sell you that , yes .
And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems .
They claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .
Now , to my innocent mind , dead implies incapable of communicating .
You might agree with me on that .
But these people , they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- &quot; Hi , there &quot; -- but they can hear the dead as well , and they can relay this information back to the living .
I wonder if that &apos;s true .
I don &apos;t think so , because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do , exactly the same -- the same physical methods , the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth , to their detriment .
They deceive these people , costs them a lot of money , cost them a lot of emotional anguish .
Billions of dollars are spent every year , all over the globe , on these charlatans .
Now , I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so .
First question : If I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear .
They listen to the spirits like this -- I &apos;m going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because , when she died , she had the family will , and she secreted it someplace . We don &apos;t know where it is , so we ask Granny , &quot; Where is the will , Granny ? &quot;
What does Granny say ? She says , &quot; I &apos;m in heaven and it &apos;s wonderful .
I &apos;m here with all my old friends , my deceased friends , and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl .
And I love you , and I &apos;ll always be with you .
Good bye . &quot;
And she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
Where is the will ?
Now , she could easily have said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s in the library on the second shelf , behind the encyclopedia , &quot; but she doesn &apos;t say that . No , she doesn &apos;t .
She doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
We paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
The second question that I &apos;d like to ask , rather simple : Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law , as an example .
Why do they insist on saying -- remember , they speak into this ear -- why do they say , &quot; My name starts with J or M ? &quot;
Is this a hunting game ?
Hunting and fishing ? What is it ?
Is it 20 questions ? No , it &apos;s more like 120 questions .
But it is a cruel , vicious , absolutely conscienceless -- I &apos;ll be all right , keep your seats -- game that these people play .
And they take advantage of the innocent , the naive , the grieving , the needy people out there .
Now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
There &apos;s one fellow out there , Van Praagh is his name , James Van Praagh .
He &apos;s one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing .
John Edward , Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea , they are other operators .
There are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , James Van Praagh is very big .
And what does he do ? He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased , the people he &apos;s talking to through his ear , you see ?
So what he says is , very often , is like this : he says , &quot; He tells me , he tells me , before he passed , that he had trouble breathing . &quot;
Folks , that &apos;s what dying is all about !
You stop breathing , and then you &apos;re dead .
It &apos;s that simple .
And that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; Why am I getting electricity ?
He &apos;s saying to me , &apos; Electricity . &apos; Was he an electrician ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Did he ever have an electric razor ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
It was a game of hunting questions like this .
This is what they go through .
Now , folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation , they call me , they say , &quot; Why are you so concerned about this , Mr. Randi ?
Isn &apos;t it just a lot of fun ? &quot;
No , it is not fun . It is a cruel farce .
Now , it may bring a certain amount of comfort , but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .
And then the people look in the mirror , and they say , I just paid a lot of money for that reading .
And what did she say to me ? &apos; I love you ! &apos; &quot; They always say that .
They don &apos;t get any information , they don &apos;t get any value for what they spend .
Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
We call her &quot; The Talons . &quot;
Sylvia Browne -- thank you -- Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment .
Now , Sylvia Browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone , she doesn &apos;t even go there in person , and you have to wait up to two years because she &apos;s booked ahead that amount of time .
You pay by credit card or whatever , and then she will call you sometime in the next two years .
You can tell it &apos;s her . &quot; Hello , this is Sylvia Browne . &quot;
That &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
Now , Montel Williams is an intelligent man .
We all know who he is on television .
He &apos;s well educated , he &apos;s smart , he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn &apos;t give a damn .
He just doesn &apos;t care .
Because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
Now , what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars ?
She gives you the names of your guardian angels , that &apos;s first .
Now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
She gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
Duh .
It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses , or something like that .
And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon .
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption .
He isn &apos;t worth bringing back , obviously .
And the strange thing -- folks , you may have noticed this too .
You see these folks on television -- they never call anybody back from hell .
Everyone comes back from heaven , but never from hell .
If they call back any of my friends , they &apos;re not going to ... Well , you see the story .
Now , Sylvia Browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the James Randi Educational Foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds .
Very simply won .
All you have to do is prove any paranormal , occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions .
It &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she &apos;s the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge .
She did this on the &quot; Larry King Live &quot; show on CNN six and a half years ago .
And we haven &apos;t heard from her since . Strange .
She said that , first of all , that she didn &apos;t know how to contact me .
Duh .
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
I &apos;m alive , you may have noticed .
Well , pretty well anyway .
She couldn &apos;t reach me . Now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because I &apos;m a godless person .
All the more reason to take the million dollars , wouldn &apos;t you think , Sylvia ?
Now these people need to be stopped , seriously now .
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
We get people coming to the foundation all the time .
They &apos;re ruined financially and emotionally because they &apos;ve given their money and their faith to these people .
Now , I popped some pills earlier .
I have to explain that to you .
Homeopathy , let &apos;s find out what that &apos;s all about .
Hmm . You &apos;ve heard of it .
It &apos;s an alternative form of healing , right ?
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that &apos;s what this is .
This is Calms Forte , 32 caplets of sleeping pills ! I forgot to tell you that .
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills .
Six and a half days , that certainly is a fatal dose .
It says right on the back here , &quot; In case of overdose , contact your poison control center immediately , &quot; and it gives an 800 number .
Keep your seats -- it &apos;s going to be okay .
I don &apos;t really need it because I &apos;ve been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years , taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills .
Why don &apos;t they affect me ?
The answer may surprise you .
What is homeopathy ?
It &apos;s taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro &apos;s limit .
Diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left .
Now folks , this is not just a metaphor I &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
Then , when you get a headache , you take a sip of this water , and -- voila ! -- it is gone .
Now that is true . That is what homeopathy is all about .
And another claim that they make -- you &apos;ll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is , they say , the more powerful it is .
Now wait a minute , we heard about a guy in Florida .
The poor man , he was on homeopathic medicine .
He died of an overdose .
He forgot to take his pill .
Work on it . Work on it .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , believing in all this nonsense over all these years .
Now , let me tell you , The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot , but I must say , the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn &apos;t mean that the powers don &apos;t exist .
They might , some place out there .
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
Well , with Sylvia Browne I would think so .
You know , 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone -- that &apos;s more than lawyers make !
I mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
These people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look silly ?
Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time ?
I think that something needs to be done about this .
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something .
If you find out -- now I understand .
We &apos;ve seen people , even today , speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with .
Those are very important , critically important to us .
And we must do something about those problems .
But at the same time , as Arthur C. Clarke said , The rotting of the human mind , the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural -- all of this total nonsense , this medieval thinking -- I think something should be done about that , and it all lies in education .
Largely , it &apos;s the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .
They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors .
It &apos;s the bottom line , the dollar line .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
We really must do something about this .
I &apos;m willing to take your suggestions , and I &apos;m willing to have you tune in to our webpage .
It &apos;s www.randi.org.
Go in there and look at the archives , and you will begin to understand much more of what I &apos;ve been talking about today .
You will see the records that we have .
There &apos;s nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune .
She cashed in the CDs , she gave away the stocks and the certificates .
That &apos;s really sad to hear , and it hasn &apos;t helped them one bit , hasn &apos;t solved any of their problems .
Yes , there could be a rotting of the American mind , and of the minds all the way around the earth , if we don &apos;t start to think sensibly about these things .
Now , we &apos;ve offered this carrot , as I say , we &apos;ve dangled the carrot .
We &apos;re waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it .
Oh , we get lots of them , hundreds of them every year come by .
These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well , but they &apos;re amateurs ; they don &apos;t know how to evaluate their own so-called powers .
The professionals never come near us , except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago .
She did accept and then backed away .
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m James Randi , and I &apos;m waiting .
Thank you .
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS , the transmission of AIDS .
I thought this was unacceptable . So I decided to do something about it .
Sadly , it &apos;s come true . Malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year .
This young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe .
And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street .
And hence they ended up in an orphanage .
And it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners , blindly giving an injection to someone .
And the injection is so valuable , that the people basically trust the doctor , being second to God , which I &apos;ve heard many times , to do the right thing . But in fact they &apos;re not .
And you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas .
This video we took undercover , which shows you , over a half an hour period , a tray of medicines of 42 vials , which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India .
And over the course of half an hour , not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .
They started with two and they ended with two .
And you &apos;ll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she &apos;s just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again .
So you can imagine the scale of this problem .
And in fact in India alone , 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe .
These kids in Pakistan don &apos;t go to school .
They are lucky . They already have a job .
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they injure themselves .
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place , which is quite bizarre .
In an interesting photo , their father , while we were talking to him , picked up a syringe and pricked his finger -- I don &apos;t know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end -- and immediately whipped out a box of matches , lit one , and burned the blood off the end of his finger , giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV .
In China , recycling is a major issue .
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sorted out , by hand , back into the right sizes , and then put back out on the street .
So recycling and reuse are the major issues here .
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia .
In all schools in Indonesia , there is usually a toy seller in the playground .
The toy seller , in this case , had syringes , which they usually do , next door to the diggers , which is obviously what you would expect .
And they use them , in the breaks , for water pistols .
They squirt them at each other , which is lovely and innocent .
And they are having great fun .
But they also drink from them while they &apos;re in their breaks , because it &apos;s hot .
And they squirt the water into their mouths .
And these are used with traces of blood visible .
So we need a better product . And we need better information .
And I think , if I can just borrow this camera , I was going to show you my invention , which I came up with .
So , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
You load it up in the normal way . This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .
You give the injection and then put it down .
If someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
It &apos;s very , very simple . Thank you .
And it costs the same as a normal syringe .
And in comparison , a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price .
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
And I have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in India .
And we &apos;re very proud of giving information to people , so that little kids like this don &apos;t do stupid things .
Thank you very much .
Jill Sobule : At a conference in Monterey by the big , big jellyfish tank , I first saw you and I got so shy . You see , I was a little paranoid &apos; cause I might have been high . And I hadn &apos;t done that in ages and I won &apos;t do that again . But that &apos;s another story . Loved you forever and I &apos;ve been a big fan , the one-woman shows , I even rented &quot; Pat . &quot; I got enough nerve to come up to you , but little did I know one year later we &apos;d be doing this show . I sing . Julia Sweeney : I tell stories . Together : The Jill and Julia Show . Sobule : Sometimes it works . Sweeney : Sometimes it doesn &apos;t . Together : The Jill and Julia Show . Sweeney : At a conference in Monterey next to the big , big jellyfish tank , I first saw you and I wasn &apos;t so shy . I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox , and Wendy and I wanted you to do the theme song .
And then the pilot didn &apos;t go and I was so sad , but I kept remaining a fan of yours .
And then when I went through that big , horrible breakup with Carl and I couldn &apos;t get off the couch , I listened to your song , &quot; Now That I Don &apos;t Have You , &quot; over and over and over and over again .
And I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here and that I &apos;m meeting you here at TED .
And also , I can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re eating sushi in front of the fish tank , which , personally , I think is really inappropriate .
And little did I know that one year later ... we &apos;d be doing this show . Sobule : I sing . Sweeney : I tell stories . Together : The Jill and Julia Show . Sobule : Hey , they asked us back ! Sweeney : Can you stand it ? !
Together : The Jill and Julia , the Jill and Julia , the Jill and Julia Show . Sobule : Why are all our heroes so imperfect ? Why do they always bring me down ? Why are all our heroes so imperfect ? Statue in the park has lost his crown . William Faulkner , drunk and depressed . Sweeney : Mmm .
Dorothy Parker , mean , drunk and depressed . Sweeney : I know .
And that guy , &quot; Seven Years in Tibet , &quot; turned out to be a Nazi . Sweeney : Yeah .
Founding fathers all had slaves . Sweeney : I know .
The explorers slaughtered the braves . Sweeney : Horribly .
Sobule : The Old Testament God can be so petty . Sweeney : Don &apos;t get me started on that .
Sobule : Paul McCartney , jealous of John , even more so now that he &apos;s gone . Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie . Pablo Picasso , cruel to his wives . Sweeney : Horrible .
Sobule : My favorite poets took their own lives . Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five , below before our eyes . And he sold bad wine . Together : Why are all our heroes so imperfect ? Yeah Why do they always bring me down ? Sobule : Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice . Sweeney : Oh .
Lewis Carroll I &apos;m sure did Alice . Sweeney : What ? !
Plato in the cave with those very young boys . Sweeney : Ooh ...
Sobule : Hillary supported the war . Sweeney : Even Thomas Friedman supported the war . Sobule : Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together : ... such a pussy . Sobule : William Faulkner , drunk and depressed , Tennessee Williams , drunk and depressed . Sweeney : Yeah .
Sobule : Take it , Julia . Sweeney : Okay . Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine .
I mean , I watch Oprah mostly when I &apos;m home in Spokane visiting my mother . And to my mother , Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope , which is actually saying something because she &apos;s a devout Catholic .
Anyway , I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness , I like her weight issues , I like how she &apos;s transformed talk television , I like how she &apos;s brought reading back to America -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment : it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone .
And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie &quot; The Secret . &quot;
Do you guys know about that movie &quot; The Secret &quot; ?
It makes &quot; What the Bleep Do We Know &quot; seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that &apos;s how bad it is .
It makes &quot; The DaVinci Code &quot; seem like &quot; War and Peace . &quot;
That movie is so horrible . It promotes such awful pseudoscience .
And the basic idea is that there &apos;s this law of attraction , and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you .
On a scientific basis , it &apos;s more than just &quot; Power of Positive Thinking &quot; -- it has a horrible , horrible dark side . Like if you get ill , it &apos;s because you &apos;ve just been thinking negative thoughts .
Yeah , stuff like that was in the movie and she &apos;s promoting it .
And all I &apos;m saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law .
So that &apos;s what I have to say .
Sobule : I sing . Sweeney : I tell stories . Together : The Jill and Julia Show . Sobule : Sometimes it works . Sweeney : Sometimes it doesn &apos;t . Together : The Jill and Julia , the Jill and Julia , the Jill and Julia Show .
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
So , here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials .
These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
This is our group , our main group of weavers .
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .
Hawa Abdi : Many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- &#91; were &#93; fighting .
So there was no job , no food .
Children , most of them , became very malnourished , like this .
Deqo Mohamed : So as you know , always in a civil war , the ones affected most &#91; are &#93; the women and children .
So our patients are women and children .
And they are in our backyard .
It &apos;s our home . We welcome them .
That &apos;s the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
Pat Mitchell : And this is your hospital . This is the inside .
H We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help .
There is no government to protect them .
Every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
But we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
It is very tough .
And as you can see , it &apos;s the women who are carrying the children ; it &apos;s the women who come into the hospitals ; it &apos;s the women &#91; are &#93; building the houses .
That &apos;s their house .
And we have a school . This is our bright -- we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
PM : And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic .
Would you explain the rules for admission ?
H The people who are coming to us , we are welcoming .
We are sharing with them whatever we have .
But there are only two rules .
First rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society .
&#91; Whomever &#93; makes those things we throw out .
The second : no man can beat his wife .
If he beat , we will put &#91; him &#93; in jail , and we will call the eldest people .
Until they identify this case , we &apos;ll never release him .
That &apos;s our two rules .
The other thing that I have realized , that the woman is the most strong person all over the world .
Because the last 20 years , the Somali woman has stood up .
They were the leaders , and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations .
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war .
We can reconcile .
We can do everything .
As my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in Somalia .
So we came up with these two rules .
In a camp with 90,000 people , you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights .
So there is no clan division , and no man can beat his wife .
And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
So if you beat your wife , you &apos;re going to be there .
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them . They are not alone for this .
PM : You &apos;re running a medical clinic .
It brought much , much needed medical care to people who wouldn &apos;t get it .
You &apos;re also running a civil society .
You &apos;ve created your own rules , in which women and children are getting a different sense of security .
Talk to me about your decision , Dr. Abdi , and your decision , Dr. Mohamed , to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances .
H My age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having , at that time , government , law and order .
But one day , I went to the hospital -- my mother was sick -- and I saw the hospital , how they &#91; were &#93; treating the doctors , how they &#91; are &#93; committed to help the sick people .
I admired them , and I decided to become a doctor .
My mother died , unfortunately , when I was 12 years &#91; old &#93; .
Then my father allowed me to proceed &#91; with &#93; my hope .
My mother died in &#91; a &#93; gynecology complication , so I decided to become a gynecology specialist .
That &apos;s why I became a doctor .
So Dr. Deqo has to explain .
For me , my mother was preparing &#91; me &#93; when I was a child to become a doctor , but I really didn &apos;t want to .
Maybe I should become an historian , or maybe a reporter .
I loved it , but it didn &apos;t work .
When the war broke out -- civil war -- I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children .
And I thought , maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist .
So I went to Russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; Soviet Union .
So some of our character , maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training .
So that &apos;s how I decided &#91; to do &#93; the same .
My sister was different .
She &apos;s here . She &apos;s also a doctor .
She graduated in Russia also .
And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when I was 16 , and my sister was 11 , when the civil war broke out .
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early &apos; 90s -- that &apos;s what made us go back and work for them .
PM : So what is the biggest challenge working , mother and daughter , in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ?
H Yes , I was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
And when I saw the people who needed me , I was staying with them to help , because I &#91; could &#93; do something for them .
Most people fled abroad .
But I remained with those people , and I was trying to do something -- &#91; any &#93; little thing I &#91; could &#93; do .
I succeeded in my place .
Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
But we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
And I &apos;m thankful for my daughters .
When they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
They do everything for them .
They have done what I desire to do for them .
PM : What &apos;s the best part of working with your mother , and the most challenging part for you ?
She &apos;s very tough ; it &apos;s most challenging .
She always expects us to do more .
And really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and I can do it .
That &apos;s the best part .
She shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp -- that &apos;s how she trains us .
It is not like beautiful offices here , 20 patients , you &apos;re tired .
You see 300 patients , 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage .
PM : But you do it for good reasons .
Wait . Wait .
H Thank you .
Thank you .
H Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
How often do we hear that people just don &apos;t care ?
How many times have you been told that real , substantial change isn &apos;t possible because most people are too selfish , too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community ?
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn &apos;t actually exist , but rather , that people do care , but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way .
And I &apos;ll give you some examples of what I mean .
Let &apos;s start with city hall .
You ever see one of these before ?
This is a newspaper ad .
It &apos;s a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what &apos;s happening .
As you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they &apos;re talking about , and then farther down , in tiny 10-point font , to find out how to actually get involved .
Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that .
Now that would never happen .
You &apos;ll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes .
Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn &apos;t want you involved with the planning process , otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly .
As long as the city &apos;s putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren &apos;t going to be engaged .
But that &apos;s not apathy ; that &apos;s intentional exclusion .
Public space .
The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we &apos;ve essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice , dominating the visual and mental environment .
The problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren &apos;t profitable to say .
So you &apos;re never going to see them on a billboard .
The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change , mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals , but even when they do talk about important political issues , they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement .
And I &apos;ll give you an example : the Now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in Toronto .
This is the cover story .
It &apos;s an article about a theater performance , and it starts with basic information about where it is , in case you actually want to go and see it after you &apos;ve read the article -- where , the time , the website .
Same with this -- it &apos;s a movie review , an art review , a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go .
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant .
So they tell you where it is , what the prices are , the address , the phone number , etc .
Then you get to their political articles .
Here &apos;s a great article about an important election race that &apos;s happening .
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information , no follow-up , no websites for the campaigns , no information about when the debates are , where the campaign offices are .
Here &apos;s another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat , maybe read a book , maybe see a movie , but not be engaged in their community .
And you might think this is a small thing , but I think it &apos;s important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport .
Heroes : How do we view leadership ?
Look at these 10 movies . What do they have in common ?
Anyone ?
They all have heroes who were chosen .
Someone came up to them and said , &quot; You &apos;re the chosen one .
There &apos;s a prophesy . You have to save the world . &quot;
And then someone goes off and saves the world because they &apos;ve been told to , with a few people tagging along .
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
A heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
Number two , it &apos;s imperfect ; it &apos;s not very glamorous , and it doesn &apos;t suddenly start and suddenly end .
It &apos;s an ongoing process your whole life .
But most importantly , it &apos;s voluntary .
It &apos;s voluntary .
As long as we &apos;re teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead , or someone tells you that you &apos;re part of a prophecy , they &apos;re missing the most important characteristic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
It &apos;s about following your own dreams -- uninvited , uninvited -- and then working with others to make those dreams come true .
Political parties : oh boy .
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics .
Instead , they &apos;ve become , sadly , uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing , pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas .
And people can smell that , and it feeds cynicism .
Charitable status : Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren &apos;t allowed to do advocacy .
This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced , especially during election time .
Which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
As you may have noticed , our elections in Canada are a complete joke .
We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results .
Canada &apos;s currently led by a party that most Canadians didn &apos;t actually want .
How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don &apos;t count in Canada ?
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
It &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
Now I &apos;m not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what &apos;s in our way .
Quite the opposite : I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care .
But that , as I said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
As long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are selfish , stupid or lazy , then there &apos;s no hope .
But we can change all those things I mentioned .
We can open up city hall .
We can reform our electoral systems .
We can democratize our public spaces .
My main message is , if we can redefine apathy , not as some kind of internal syndrome , but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement , and if we can clearly define , we can clearly identify , what those obstacles are , and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles , then anything is possible .
Thank you .
The work of a transportation commissioner isn &apos;t just about stop signs and traffic signals .
It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets .
Streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has , and yet it &apos;s an asset that &apos;s largely hidden in plain sight .
And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset .
You can remake your streets quickly , inexpensively , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular .
You just need to look at them a little differently .
This is important because we live in an urban age .
For the first time in history , most people live in cities , and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years , the population is going to double on the planet .
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future .
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007 .
The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace , and that if we &apos;re going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here , we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure .
For many cities , our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations .
This is a picture of Times Square in the &apos; 50s , and despite all of the technological innovation , cultural changes , political changes , this is Times Square in 2008 .
Not much has changed in those 50 years .
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them .
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks .
Having goals is important , because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction , you need to know where you &apos;re going and why .
The design of a street can tell you everything about what &apos;s expected on it .
In this case , it &apos;s expected that you shelter in place .
The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B , and it misses all the other ways that a street is used .
When we started out , we did some early surveys about how our streets were used , and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats .
Pictures like this , people perched on a fire hydrant , not the mark of a world-class city .
It &apos;s not great for parents with kids .
It &apos;s not great for seniors . It &apos;s not great for retailers .
It &apos;s probably not good for the fire hydrants .
Certainly not good for the police department .
So we worked hard to change that balance , and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square .
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square , and people had tried for years to make changes .
They changed signals , they changed lanes , everything they could do to make Times Square work better .
It was dangerous , hard to cross the street .
It was chaotic .
And so , none of those approaches worked , so we took a different approach , a bigger approach , looked at our street differently .
And so we did a six-month pilot .
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
And the temporary materials are an important part of the program , because we were able to show how it worked .
And I work for a data-driven mayor , as you probably know .
So it was all about the data .
So if it worked better for traffic , if it was better for mobility , if it was safer , better for business , we would keep it , and if it didn &apos;t work , no harm , no foul , we could put it back the way that it was , because these were temporary materials .
And that was a very big part of the buy-in , much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back .
But the results were overwhelming .
Traffic moved better . It was much safer .
Five new flagship stores opened .
It &apos;s been a total home run .
Times Square is now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet .
And this is an important lesson , because it doesn &apos;t need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space .
Every project has its surprises , and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space .
We put out the orange barrels , and people just materialized immediately into the street .
It was like a Star Trek episode , you know ?
They weren &apos;t there before , and then zzzzzt !
All the people arrived .
Where they &apos;d been , I don &apos;t know , but they were there .
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us , because the street furniture had not yet arrived .
So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs , and we put those lawn chairs out on the street .
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town .
It wasn &apos;t about that we &apos;d closed Broadway to cars .
It was about those lawn chairs .
&quot; What did you think about the lawn chairs ? &quot;
&quot; Do you like the color of the lawn chairs ? &quot;
So if you &apos;ve got a big , controversial project , think about lawn chairs .
This is the final design for Times Square , and it will create a level surface , sidewalk to sidewalk , beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards , creating a great new energy on the street , and we think it &apos;s going to really create a great place , a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name .
And we will be cutting the ribbon on this , the first phase , this December .
With all of our projects , our public space projects , we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces , move the furniture , take care of the plants .
This is in front of Macy &apos;s , and they were a big supporter of this new approach , because they understood that more people on foot is better for business .
And we &apos;ve done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods .
This is in Bed-Stuy , Brooklyn , and you can see the short leg that was there , used for cars , that &apos;s not really needed .
So what we did is we painted over the street , put down epoxy gravel , and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue , created a great new public space , and it &apos;s been great for businesses along Grand Avenue .
We did the same thing in DUMBO , in Brooklyn , and this is one of our first projects that we did , and we took an underutilized , pretty dingy-looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend .
And in the three years since we &apos;ve implemented the project , retail sales have increased 172 percent .
And that &apos;s twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood .
We &apos;ve moved very , very quickly with paint and temporary materials .
Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done , we &apos;ve done it with paint and temporary materials .
And the proof is not in a computer model .
It is in the real-world performance of the street .
You can have fun with paint .
All told , we &apos;ve created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city .
We &apos;ve repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space .
I think one of the successes is in its emulation .
You &apos;re seeing this kind of approach , since we &apos;ve painted Times Square , you &apos;ve seen this approach in Boston , in Chicago , in San Francisco , in Mexico City , Buenos Aires , you name it .
This is actually in Los Angeles , and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets .
But I can &apos;t underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods .
We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program , and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York .
I think it &apos;s fair to say -- -- it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike , and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States .
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes .
You can see the map in 2007 .
This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes .
I love this because it looks so easy .
You just click it , and they &apos;re there .
We also brought new designs to the street .
We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States .
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes , and it &apos;s been great .
Bike volumes have spiked .
Injuries to all users , pedestrians , cyclists , drivers , are all down 50 percent .
And we &apos;ve built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes , and now you &apos;re seeing them pop up all over the country .
And you can see here that this strategy has worked .
The blue line is the number of cyclists , soaring .
The green line is the number of bike lanes .
And the yellow line is the number of injuries , which has remained essentially flat .
After this big expansion , you &apos;ve seen no net increase in injuries , and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers .
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes , and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago .
One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West &quot; the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip . &quot;
And this is what we had done .
So if you dig below the headlines , though , you &apos;ll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians .
In fact , I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers .
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes .
This summer , we launched Citi Bike , the largest bike share program in the United States , with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another .
Since we &apos;ve launched the program , three million trips have been taken .
People have ridden seven million miles .
That &apos;s 280 times around the globe .
And so with this little blue key , you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option .
And daily usage just continues to soar .
What has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of New York is 36,000 people .
The high that we &apos;ve had so far is 44,000 in August .
Yesterday , 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City .
The bikes are being used six times a day .
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets .
In the past , it looked like the guy on the left , ninja-clad bike messenger .
And today , cyclists look like New York City looks .
It &apos;s diverse -- young , old , black , white , women , kids , all getting on a bike .
It &apos;s an affordable , safe , convenient way to get around .
Quite radical .
We &apos;ve also brought this approach to our buses , and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America , the slowest bus speeds .
As everybody knows , you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus .
And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City , built out six bus rapid transit lines , 57 miles of new speedy bus lanes .
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus .
We &apos;ve got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane , and it &apos;s been a huge success .
I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike , and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane , and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands , and the traffic was flowing , birds were singing -- -- the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes .
It was just fantastic .
And this is how it looked six years ago .
And so , I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it &apos;s possible to change your streets quickly , it &apos;s not expensive , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular .
You just need to reimagine your streets .
They &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
Thank you .
It &apos;s the Second World War .
A German prison camp .
And this man , Archie Cochrane , is a prisoner of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn &apos;t really understand .
The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin .
But he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
He doesn &apos;t know how to cure it .
And he &apos;s operating in a hostile environment .
And people do terrible things in wars .
The German camp guards , they &apos;ve got bored .
They &apos;ve taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .
On one particular occasion , one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners &apos; lavatory while it was full of prisoners .
He said he heard suspicious laughter .
And Archie Cochrane , as the camp doctor , was one of the first men in to clear up the mess .
And one more thing : Archie was suffering from this illness himself .
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .
But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person .
He &apos;d already smuggled vitamin C into the camp , and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market .
Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is .
Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British .
It looks like crude oil .
It tastes ...
zesty .
And importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vitamin B12 .
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups .
He gives half of them vitamin C.
He gives half of them vitamin B12 .
He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book .
And after just a few days , it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness , marmite is the cure .
So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp .
Now you &apos;ve got to imagine at the moment -- forget this photo , imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair .
He hasn &apos;t been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure .
Cochrane , he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German , by the way , but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world .
And he can &apos;t understand how this barbarism can be tolerated , and he vents his frustrations .
And then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and weeps because he &apos;s convinced that the situation is hopeless .
But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane &apos;s exercise book and says to his colleagues , &quot; This evidence is incontrovertible .
If we don &apos;t supply vitamins to the prisoners , it &apos;s a war crime . &quot;
And the next morning , supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp , and the prisoners begin to recover .
Now I &apos;m not telling you this story because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude , although Archie Cochrane is a dude .
I &apos;m not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy , although I think that would also be completely awesome .
I &apos;m telling you this story because Archie Cochrane , all his life , fought against a terrible affliction , and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies .
And he had a name for it .
He called it the God complex .
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very , very easily .
So the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .
Now Archie was a doctor , so he hung around with doctors a lot .
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot .
Now I &apos;m an economist , I &apos;m not a doctor , but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
I see it in our business leaders .
I see it in the politicians we vote for -- people who , in the face of an incredibly complicated world , are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works .
And you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
Well let me give you an example .
Imagine for a moment that , instead of Tim Harford in front of you , there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs .
You know Hans : the Mick Jagger of TED .
And he &apos;d be showing you these amazing statistics , these amazing animations .
And they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
But a typical Hans Rosling graph : think for a moment , not what it shows , but think instead about what it leaves out .
So it &apos;ll show you GDP per capita , population , longevity , that &apos;s about it .
So three pieces of data for each country -- three pieces of data .
Three pieces of data is nothing .
I mean , have a look at this graph .
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo .
He &apos;s at MIT .
Now you won &apos;t be able to understand a word of it , but this is what it looks like .
Cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products , and he &apos;s used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products .
And it &apos;s wonderful , wonderful work .
You show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
And I think it &apos;ll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow .
Brilliant work .
Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works .
And what we learned is Cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine .
Five thousand products -- that &apos;s still nothing .
Five thousand products -- imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo &apos;s data .
Imagine you had one second per product category .
In about the length of this session , you would have counted all 5,000 .
Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart .
There are 100,000 there . It would take you all day .
Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo , London or New York .
It &apos;s even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan .
If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York -- there are 10 billion of them -- it would take you 317 years .
This is how complex the economy we &apos;ve created is .
And I &apos;m just counting toasters here .
I &apos;m not trying to solve the Middle East problem .
The complexity here is unbelievable .
And just a piece of context -- the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services .
You could count them in five minutes .
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us .
This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting .
We tend to retreat and say , &quot; We can draw a picture , we can post some graphs , we get it , we understand how this works . &quot;
And we don &apos;t .
We never do .
Now I &apos;m not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here .
I &apos;m not trying to say we can &apos;t solve complicated problems in a complicated world .
We clearly can .
But the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
And we have a problem-solving technique that works .
Now you show me a successful complex system , and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error .
Here &apos;s an example .
This baby was produced through trial and error .
I realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement .
Maybe I should clarify it .
This baby is a human body : it evolved .
What is evolution ?
Over millions of years , variation and selection , variation and selection -- trial and error , trial and error .
And it &apos;s not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error .
You could use it in an industrial context .
So let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
Let &apos;s say you &apos;re Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool .
How do you do it ?
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent .
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle .
You create a spray of detergent .
Then the spray dries . It turns into powder .
It falls to the floor .
You scoop it up . You put it in cardboard boxes .
You sell it at a supermarket .
You make lots of money .
How do you design that nozzle ?
It turns out to be very important .
Now if you ascribe to the God complex , what you do is you find yourself a little God .
You find yourself a mathematician ; you find yourself a physicist -- somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid .
And he will , or she will , calculate the optimal design of the nozzle .
Now Unilever did this and it didn &apos;t work -- too complicated .
Even this problem , too complicated .
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error , variation and selection .
You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle .
You try out all 10 ; you keep the one that works best .
You create 10 variations on that one .
You try out all 10 . You keep the one that works best .
You try out 10 variations on that one .
You see how this works , right ?
And after 45 generations , you have this incredible nozzle .
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly .
We have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
And the moment you step back from the God complex -- let &apos;s just try to have a bunch of stuff ; let &apos;s have a systematic way of determining what &apos;s working and what &apos;s not -- you can solve your problem .
Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize .
And we &apos;ve heard a lot about how economies function .
The U.S. economy is still the world &apos;s greatest economy .
How did it become the world &apos;s greatest economy ?
I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy , but I think the most salient one is this : ten percent of American businesses disappear every year .
That is a huge failure rate .
It &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , Americans .
Ten percent of Americans don &apos;t disappear every year .
Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans , and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans .
And eventually , they &apos;ll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets -- if , of course , they haven &apos;t already done so .
I sometimes wonder .
But it &apos;s this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence , this incredible performance of Western economies .
It didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
It &apos;s come through trial and error .
Now I &apos;ve been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months , and people sometimes say to me , &quot; Well Tim , it &apos;s kind of obvious .
Obviously trial and error is very important .
Obviously experimentation is very important .
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing ? &quot;
So I say , okay , fine .
You think it &apos;s obvious ?
I will admit it &apos;s obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don &apos;t have a correct answer .
Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer .
And there &apos;s an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher &apos;s desk who knows all the answers .
And if you can &apos;t find the answers , you must be lazy or stupid .
When schools stop doing that all the time , I will admit that , yes , it &apos;s obvious that trial and error is a good thing .
When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says , &quot; I want to fix our health system .
I want to fix our education system .
I have no idea how to do it .
I have half a dozen ideas .
We &apos;re going to test them out . They &apos;ll probably all fail .
Then we &apos;ll test some other ideas out .
We &apos;ll find some that work . We &apos;ll build on those .
We &apos;ll get rid of the ones that don &apos;t . &quot; -- when a politician campaigns on that platform , and more importantly , when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician , then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works , and that -- thank you .
Until then , until then I &apos;m going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex .
Because it &apos;s so hard to admit our own fallibility .
It &apos;s so uncomfortable .
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody .
There &apos;s this one trial he ran many years after World War II .
He wanted to test out the question of , where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks ?
Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital , or should they recover at home ?
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
They had the God complex in spades .
They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .
Nevertheless , Archie managed to get permission to do this .
He ran his trial .
And after the trial had been running for a little while , he gathered together all his colleagues around his table , and he said , &quot; Well , gentlemen , we have some preliminary results .
They &apos;re not statistically significant .
But we have something .
And it turns out that you &apos;re right and I &apos;m wrong .
It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home .
They should be in hospital . &quot;
And there &apos;s this uproar , and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying , &quot; We always said you were unethical , Archie .
You &apos;re killing people with your clinical trials . You need to shut it down now .
Shut it down at once . &quot;
And there &apos;s this huge hubbub .
Archie lets it die down .
And then he says , &quot; Well that &apos;s very interesting , gentlemen , because when I gave you the table of results , I swapped the two columns around .
It turns out your hospitals are killing people , and they should be at home .
Would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? &quot;
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing .
And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say , &quot; Here in my own little world , I am a god , I understand everything .
I do not want to have my opinions challenged .
I do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot;
It feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
Cochrane understood that uncertainty , that fallibility , that being challenged , they hurt .
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
Now I &apos;m not going to pretend that this is easy .
It isn &apos;t easy .
It &apos;s incredibly painful .
And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject , I &apos;ve been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject .
So shortly after the war , this young man , Yutaka Taniyama , developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture .
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat &apos;s Last Theorem .
In fact , it turns out it &apos;s equivalent to proving Fermat &apos;s Last Theorem .
You prove one , you prove the other .
But it was always a conjecture .
Taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958 , Yutaka Taniyama killed himself .
His friend , Goro Shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later , reflected on Taniyama &apos;s life .
He said , &quot; He was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
He made a lot of mistakes .
But he made mistakes in a good direction .
I tried to emulate him , but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes . &quot;
Thank you .
The Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos , so before I go any further , let me show you a little bit of a montage .
Salman Khan : So the hypotenuse is now going to be five .
This animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of South America -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of Africa .
We can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
National Assembly : They create the Committee of Public Safety , which sounds like a very nice committee .
Notice , this is an aldehyde , and it &apos;s an alcohol .
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells .
A galaxy . Hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
Oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
And for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer .
If this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
SK : We now have on the order of 2,200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to vector calculus and some of the stuff you saw there .
We have a million students a month using the site , watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day .
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
But before I do that , I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started .
And some of you all might know , about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund , and I was in Boston , and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans , remotely .
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up really just as a kind of nice-to-have , just a supplement for my cousins -- something that might give them a refresher or something .
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .
The first was the feedback from my cousins .
They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person .
And once you get over the backhanded nature of that , there was actually something very profound there .
They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin .
At first , it &apos;s very unintuitive , but when you actually think about it from their point of view , it makes a ton of sense .
You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin , without feeling like they &apos;re wasting my time .
If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago , or maybe a couple of years ago , they don &apos;t have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin .
They can just watch those videos . If they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
They can watch it at their own time , at their own pace .
And probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time , the very first time that you &apos;re trying to get your brain around a new concept , the very last thing you need is another human being saying , &quot; Do you understand this ? &quot;
And that &apos;s what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before , and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room .
The other thing that happened is -- I put them on YouTube just -- I saw no reason to make it private , so I let other people watch it , and then people started stumbling on it , and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people from around the world .
And these are just a few .
This is actually from one of the original calculus videos .
And someone wrote just on YouTube -- it was a YouTube comment : &quot; First time I smiled doing a derivative . &quot;
And let &apos;s pause here .
This person did a derivative and then they smiled .
And then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .
You can go on YouTube and look at these comments -- someone else wrote : &quot; Same thing here .
I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day .
Since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class , and here I &apos;m all like , &apos; I know kung fu . &apos; &quot; And we get a lot of feedback all along those lines .
This clearly was helping people .
But then , as the viewership kept growing and kept growing , I started getting letters from people , and it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a nice-to-have .
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters .
&quot; My 12 year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math .
We have tried everything , viewed everything , bought everything .
We stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through .
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions . Again , he got it .
We could not believe it .
He is so excited . &quot;
And so you can imagine , here I was an analyst at a hedge fund .
It was very strange for me to do something of social value .
But I was excited , so I kept going .
And then a few other things started to dawn on me .
That , not only would it help my cousins right now , or these people who are sending letters , but that this content will never go old , that it could help their kids or their grandkids .
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus , I wouldn &apos;t have to .
Assuming he was good . We don &apos;t know .
The other thing that happened -- and even at this point , I said , &quot; Okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supplement .
It &apos;s good for motivated students .
It &apos;s good for maybe home schoolers . &quot;
But I didn &apos;t think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom .
But then I started getting letters from teachers .
And the teachers would write , saying , &quot; We &apos;ve used your videos to flip the classroom .
You &apos;ve given the lectures , so now what we do ... &quot; -- and this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow -- &quot; ... what I do is I assign the lectures for homework , and what used to be homework , I now have the students doing in the classroom . &quot;
And I want to pause here for -- I want to pause here for a second , because there &apos;s a couple of interesting things .
One , when those teachers are doing that , there &apos;s the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did .
They can pause , repeat at their own pace , at their own time .
But the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , letting them do work , having the teacher walk around , having the peers actually be able to interact with each other , these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom .
They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips , not allowed to interact with each other .
A teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagonistic -- and now it &apos;s a human experience .
Now they &apos;re actually interacting with each other .
So once the Khan Academy -- I quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we &apos;re a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ?
How do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion ?
And so what I &apos;m showing you over here , these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins .
The ones I started were much more primitive .
This is a more competent version of it .
But the paradigm here is , we &apos;ll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
You get hints , the actual steps for that problem , if you don &apos;t know how to do it .
But the paradigm here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on .
But it &apos;s fundamentally different than what &apos;s happening in classrooms right now .
In a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam .
And that exam , whether you get a 70 percent , an 80 percent , a 90 percent or a 95 percent , the class moves on to the next topic .
And even that 95 percent student , what was the five percent they didn &apos;t know ?
Maybe they didn &apos;t know what happens when you raise something to the zero power .
And then you go build on that in the next concept .
That &apos;s analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle , and maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time , and I give you that bicycle for two weeks .
And then I come back after two weeks , and I say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s see . You &apos;re having trouble taking left turns .
You can &apos;t quite stop .
You &apos;re an 80 percent bicyclist . &quot;
So I put a big C stamp on your forehead and then I say , &quot; Here &apos;s a unicycle . &quot;
But as ridiculous as that sounds , that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in our classrooms right now .
And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers , and it &apos;s usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .
So our model is learn math the way you &apos;d learn anything , like the way you would learn a bicycle .
Stay on that bicycle . Fall off that bicycle .
Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery .
The traditional model , it penalizes you for experimentation and failure , but it does not expect mastery .
We encourage you to experiment . We encourage you to failure .
But we do expect mastery .
This is just another one of the modules .
This is trigonometry .
This is shifting and reflecting functions .
And they all fit together .
We have about 90 of these right now .
And you can go to the site right now . It &apos;s all free . Not trying to sell anything .
But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map .
That top node right there , that &apos;s literally single digit addition .
It &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
And the paradigm is , once you get 10 in a row on that , it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules .
So if you keep further down the knowledge map , we &apos;re getting into more advanced arithmetic .
Further down , you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra .
Further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus .
And the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework .
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic , you have computer programming , you have grammar , you have genetics , all based off of that core of , if you know this and that , now you &apos;re ready for this next concept .
Now that can work well for an individual learner , and I encourage , one , for you to do it with your kids , but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself .
It &apos;ll change what happens at the dinner table .
But what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom And so what I &apos;m showing you here , this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district , where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum .
These kids aren &apos;t using textbooks , they &apos;re not getting one-size-fits-all lectures .
They &apos;re doing Khan Academy , they &apos;re doing that software , for roughly half of their math class .
And I want to make it clear , we don &apos;t view this as the complete math education .
What it does is -- and this is what &apos;s happening in Los Altos -- it frees up time .
This is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow .
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live dashboard from Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard .
Every row is a student .
Every column is one of those concepts .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
Blue means they &apos;re working on it -- no need to worry .
Red means they &apos;re stuck .
And what the teacher does is literally just say , &quot; Let me intervene on the red kids . &quot;
Or even better , &quot; Let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer . &quot;
Now I come from a very data-centric reality , so we don &apos;t want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : &quot; Oh , what do you not understand ? &quot; or &quot; What do you do understand ? &quot;
and all of the rest .
So our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible -- really data that , in almost any other field , is expected , if you &apos;re in finance or marketing or manufacturing -- and so the teachers can actually diagnose what &apos;s wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible .
So now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been spending every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pause the videos , what did they stop watching , what exercises are they using , what have they been focused on ?
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on .
The inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
And the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .
Red is wrong , blue is right .
The leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted .
They watched the video right over there .
And then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row .
It &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
They also got faster .
The height is how long it took them .
So when you talk about self-paced learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak , differentiated learning -- but it &apos;s kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom .
Because every time we &apos;ve done this , in every classroom we &apos;ve done , over and over again , if you go five days into it , there &apos;s a group of kids who &apos;ve raced ahead and there &apos;s a group of kids who are a little bit slower .
And in a traditional model , if you did a snapshot assessment , you say , &quot; These are the gifted kids , these are the slow kids .
Maybe they should be tracked differently .
Maybe we should put them in different classes . &quot;
But when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit &#91; of &#93; extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead .
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago , you now would think are gifted .
And we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
And it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time .
Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos , our goal is to use technology to humanize , not just in Los Altos , but on a global scale , what &apos;s happening in education .
And actually , that kind of brings an interesting point .
A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
In our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
So in a traditional model , most of the teacher &apos;s time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot .
Maybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them .
Now 100 percent of their time is .
So once again , using technology , not just flipping the classroom , you &apos;re humanizing the classroom , I &apos;d argue , by a factor of five or 10 .
And as valuable as that is in Los Altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who &apos;s embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta who has to help his family during the day , and that &apos;s the reason why he or she can &apos;t go to school .
Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate , or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don &apos;t know .
Now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom .
But this is all one system .
There &apos;s no reason why you can &apos;t have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom .
Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son , or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta ?
And I think what you &apos;ll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .
And that &apos;s essentially what we &apos;re trying to build .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : I &apos;ve seen some things you &apos;re doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
SK : Oh yeah . No , we have an awesome team working on it .
And I have to make it clear , it &apos;s not just me anymore .
I &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
Yeah , we &apos;ve put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get these badges , we &apos;re going to start having leader boards by area , and you get points .
It &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
Just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something , we see on a system-wide basis , like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another , depending what badge you give them .
And the collaboration you &apos;re doing with Los Altos , how did that come about ?
SK : Los Altos , it was kind of crazy .
Once again , I didn &apos;t expect it to be used in classrooms .
Someone from their board came and said , &quot; What would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we &apos;d give a dashboard . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Oh , this is kind of radical . We have to think about it . &quot;
And me and the rest of the team were like , &quot; They &apos;re never going to want to do this . &quot;
But literally the next day they were like , &quot; Can you start in two weeks ? &quot;
So fifth grade math is where that &apos;s going on right now ?
SK : It &apos;s two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes .
And they &apos;re doing it at the district level .
I think what they &apos;re excited about is they can now follow these kids .
It &apos;s not an only-in-school thing .
We &apos;ve even , on Christmas , we saw some of the kids were doing it .
And we can track everything .
So they can actually track them as they go through the entire district .
Through the summers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continuity of data that even at the district level they can see .
So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what &apos;s going on with those kids .
So you &apos;re getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they mean ?
SK : Oh yeah . Most of those were specs by the teachers .
We made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves .
And they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; Hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; Like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . &quot;
So we made that focus diagram .
So it &apos;s all been teacher-driven .
It &apos;s been pretty crazy .
Is this ready for prime time ?
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
SK : Yeah , it &apos;s ready .
We &apos;ve got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more .
No , no reason why it really can &apos;t happen in every classroom in America tomorrow .
And the vision of the tutoring thing .
The idea there is , if I &apos;m confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface I &apos;d find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and I could schedule and connect up with those people ?
SK : Absolutely . And this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do .
Those dashboards the teachers have , you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids , or nephews , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club .
And yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately .
But yeah , it &apos;s all there .
Well , it &apos;s amazing .
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century .
In the 21st century , we need to actually look at -- and what I &apos;m actually going to encourage you to consider today -- is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count .
But I think it &apos;s time for us to think about what we count .
Because what we actually count truly counts .
Let me start by telling you a little story .
This is Van Quach .
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam .
She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America .
Her first job was at an inner-city motel in San Francisco as a maid .
I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there .
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years .
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old , in 1987 , I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre , a very impractical name , because I actually was looking to create joy of life .
And this first hotel that I bought , motel , was a pay-by-the-hour , no-tell motel in the inner-city of San Francisco .
As I spent time with Vivian , I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work .
It made me question and curious : How could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
So I spent time with Vivian , and I saw that she didn &apos;t find joy in cleaning toilets .
Her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world &apos;s greatest toilet scrubber .
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests .
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home .
That very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9 / 11 , San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels .
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area , so we were particularly vulnerable .
But also back then , remember we stopped eating French fries in this country .
Well , not exactly , of course not .
We started eating &quot; freedom fries , &quot; and we started boycotting anything that was French .
Well , my name of my company , Joie de Vivre -- so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company .
And I &apos;d write them back , and I &apos;d say , &quot; What a minute . We &apos;re not French .
We &apos;re an American company . We &apos;re based in San Francisco . &quot;
And I &apos;d get a terse response : &quot; Oh , that &apos;s worse . &quot;
So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre , I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices .
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .
But given my befuddled state of mind , I ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
That &apos;s where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow &apos;s &quot; hierarchy of needs . &quot;
I took one psychology class in college , and I learned about this guy , Abraham Maslow , as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs .
But as I sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading Maslow , I recognized something that is true of most leaders .
One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect , and that is that we &apos;re all human .
Each of us , no matter what our role is in business , has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .
So as I started reading more Maslow , what I started to realize is that Maslow , later in his life , wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective , to organizations and specifically to business .
But unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow .
And that &apos;s what I did a few years ago when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
It &apos;s not just fundamental in business , it &apos;s fundamental in life .
And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs , these transformational needs for our key employees in the company .
These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow &apos;s hierarchy of needs .
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , I realized we had no metrics .
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right .
So we started asking ourselves : What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees &apos; sense of meaning , or our customers &apos; sense of emotional connection with us ?
For example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?
We started asking our customers , did they feel an emotional connection with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways .
Miraculously , as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid , what we found is we created more loyalty .
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed .
Our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average , and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size .
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time , what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure .
What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
They didn &apos;t even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
So I started asking myself the question : How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible ?
If we &apos;re taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we &apos;re missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
So I went out and studied a bunch of things , and I found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business , things like intellectual property , their corporate culture , their brand loyalty , and yet , only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .
So as leaders , we understand that intangibles are important , but we don &apos;t have a clue how to measure them .
So here &apos;s another Einstein quote : &quot; Not everything that can be counted counts , and not everything that counts can be counted . &quot;
I hate to argue with Einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can &apos;t be counted or valued , aren &apos;t we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane ?
It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks .
I flew off to a place that &apos;s been shrouded in mystery for centuries , a place some folks call Shangri-La .
It &apos;s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
I went to Bhutan .
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man , but this was back in 1972 , when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away .
At age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you &apos;d expect of someone with a beginner &apos;s mind .
On a trip through India , early in his reign as king , he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP , the size of the Bhutanese GDP .
The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
He said the following , he said : &quot; Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product ?
Why don &apos;t we care more about gross national happiness ? &quot;
Now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as GNH , or gross national happiness .
Most world leaders didn &apos;t take notice , and those that did thought this was just &quot; Buddhist economics . &quot;
But the king was serious .
This was a notable moment , because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness -- that leader 200 years ago , Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence -- 200 years later , this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure , and it &apos;s something we should actually value as government officials .
For the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
Bhutan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the newest democracy in the world , just two years ago .
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement , I got to really understand what they &apos;re doing .
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister .
Over dinner , I asked him an impertinent question .
I asked him , &quot; How can you create and measure something which evaporates -- in other words , happiness ? &quot;
And he &apos;s a very wise man , and he said , &quot; Listen , Bhutan &apos;s goal is not to create happiness .
We create the conditions for happiness to occur .
In other words , we create a habitat of happiness . &quot;
Wow , that &apos;s interesting .
He said that they have a science behind that art , and they &apos;ve actually created four essential pillars , nine key indicators and 72 different metrics that help them to measure their GNH .
One of those key indicators is : How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?
It &apos;s a good question . How do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world .
And yet , of course , that little intangible piece of data doesn &apos;t factor into our GDP calculations .
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas , I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation .
And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel .
How many know him ? Anybody ?
1954 , he wrote a book called &quot; The Real Enjoyment of Living , &quot; and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want ; instead , it &apos;s about wanting what you have .
Or in other words , I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .
The Bhutanese aren &apos;t on some aspirational treadmill , constantly focused on what they don &apos;t have .
Their religion , their isolation , their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GNH movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have .
How many of us here , as TEDsters in the audience , spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation , in the denominator ?
We are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
The reality is , in Western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we &apos;re supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
Actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many dictionaries define pursuit as to &quot; chase with hostility . &quot;
Do we pursue happiness with hostility ?
Good question . But back to Bhutan .
Bhutan &apos;s bordered on its north and south by 38 percent of the world &apos;s population .
Could this little country , like a startup in a mature industry , be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle-class in China and India ?
Bhutan &apos;s created the ultimate export , a new global currency of well-being , and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH .
You may have heard , this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an 18-month study by two Nobel economists , focusing on happiness and wellness in France .
Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index , what some French are calling a &quot; joie de vivre index . &quot;
I like it .
Co-branding opportunities .
Just three days ago , three days ago here at TED , we had a simulcast of David Cameron , potentially the next prime minister of the UK , quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time , Robert Kennedy &apos;s poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we &apos;re myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric .
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
I &apos;ve taken that Robert Kennedy quote , and I &apos;ve turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here .
This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote .
GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods .
But it doesn &apos;t count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials .
As you look at these two columns here , doesn &apos;t it make you feel like it &apos;s time for us to start figuring out a new way to count , a new way to imagine what &apos;s important to us in life ?
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
He said GDP &quot; measures everything in short , except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot;
Wow .
So how do we do that ?
Let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now , at least in this country .
Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in 2010 ?
We &apos;re spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
We &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
But all of those questions are tangible .
They &apos;re about demographics .
They &apos;re about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not .
That &apos;s about it .
We &apos;re not asking meaningful metrics .
We &apos;re not asking important questions .
We &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
Abe Maslow said long ago something you &apos;ve heard before , but you didn &apos;t realize it was him .
He said , &quot; If the only tool you have is a hammer , everything starts to look like a nail . &quot;
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
Excuse that expression .
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
GDP has been our hammer .
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success .
And yet , 64 percent of the world &apos;s GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service , the service industry , the industry I &apos;m in .
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture .
So maybe it &apos;s time that we get a bigger toolbox , right ?
Maybe it &apos;s time we get a toolbox that doesn &apos;t just count what &apos;s easily counted , the tangible in life , but actually counts what we most value , the things that are intangible .
I guess I &apos;m sort of a curious CEO .
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad .
I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
They aren &apos;t the same .
In fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
In Vivian &apos;s case , her unit of production isn &apos;t the tangible hours she works , it &apos;s the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .
This is Dave Arringdale who &apos;s actually been a longtime guest at Vivian &apos;s motel .
He stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years , and he &apos;s loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .
They &apos;ve created a habitat of happiness for Dave .
He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home .
Why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don &apos;t see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business ?
We don &apos;t have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits , we can have both .
In fact , inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits , right ?
So what the world needs now , in my opinion , is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count .
We count numbers .
We count on people .
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people .
I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country .
What can you start counting today ?
What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life , whether it &apos;s your work life or your business life ?
Thank you very much .
This is Aunt Zip from Sodom , North Carolina .
She was 105 years old when I took this picture .
She was always saying things that made me stop and think , like , &quot; Time may be a great healer , but it ain &apos;t no beauty specialist . &quot;
She said , &quot; Be good to your friends .
Why , without them , you &apos;d be a total stranger . &quot;
This is one of her songs .
Let &apos;s see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together .
And I &apos;m going to have Michael Manring play bass with me .
Give him a big old hand .
One , two , three , four .
Well , my true love &apos;s a black-eyed daisy ; if I don &apos;t see her , I go crazy .
My true love lives up the river ; a few more jumps and I &apos;ll be with her .
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
Hey , hey black-eyed Susie , hey .
Now you &apos;ve got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom , North Carolina .
I &apos;d go up and learn these old songs from her .
She couldn &apos;t sing much , couldn &apos;t play anymore .
And I &apos;d pull her out on the front porch .
Down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule .
A double outhouse over here on the side .
And we &apos;d sing this old song . She didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so I &apos;d sing , &quot; Hey , hey ! &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; Black-eyed Susie . &quot;
Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey .
Well , she and I went blackberry picking .
She got mad ; I took a licking .
Ducks on the millpond , geese in the ocean , Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion .
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
Hey , hey black-eyed Susie , hey .
Let &apos;s have the banjo .
Well , we &apos;ll get married next Thanksgiving .
I &apos;ll lay around ; she &apos;ll make a living .
She &apos;ll cook blackjacks , I &apos;ll cook gravy ; we &apos;ll have chicken someday , maybe .
Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey !
One more time now .
Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey .
Thank you , Michael .
This is Ralph Stanley .
When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies , taking majors in biology and art , he came to the campus .
This was in 1968 , I guess it was .
And he played his bluegrass style of music , but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa , along with the banjo .
It &apos;s called claw-hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
I fell in love with that .
I went up to him and said , how can I learn that ?
He said , well , you can go back to Clinch Mountain , where I &apos;m from , or Asheville or Mount Airy , North Carolina -- some place that has a lot of music .
Because there &apos;s a lot of old people still living that play that old style .
So I went back that very summer .
I just fell in love with the culture and the people .
And you know , I came back to school , I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player .
You can imagine how excited they were .
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I &apos;ve taken of some of my mentors .
Just a few of them , but maybe you &apos;ll get just a little hint of some of these folks .
And play a little banjo . Let &apos;s do a little medley .
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks , who just passed away last year .
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers .
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this , you could hardly understand him . But it was really wonderful .
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built .
No running water , no electricity . A wonderful , wonderful guy .
And you can look at more pictures .
I &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that I &apos;ve done of some of the other folks I didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
This instrument came up in those pictures . It &apos;s called the mouth bow .
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world , and still played in the Southern mountains .
Now , the old timers didn &apos;t take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this .
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up .
It was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument .
It sounds something like this .
Well , have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys ?
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
Now , they were scouts in the rebels &apos; army , they were known both far and wide .
When the Yankees saw them coming , they &apos;d lay down their guns and hide .
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
Ain &apos;t that a sound ?
Well , it was 1954 , I guess it was .
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville , Texas , where I grew up in the early part of my life .
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store .
My mom was driving ; my brother and I were in the back seat .
We were really mad at my mom . We looked out the window .
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .
You see , we &apos;d just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it .
And , buddy , that made us mad .
Well , my mom didn &apos;t put up with much either , and she was driving , and she said , &quot; You boys ! You think you can have anything you want .
You don &apos;t know how hard it is to earn money . Your dad works so hard .
You think money grows on trees . You &apos;ve never worked a day in your lives .
You boys make me so mad . You &apos;re going to get a job this summer . &quot;
She pulled the car over ; she said , &quot; Get out of the car . &quot;
My brother and I stepped out of the car .
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking .
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders . She marched us out in the field .
She went up to the foreman ; she said , &quot; I &apos;ve got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . &quot;
Of course , we were just eight and 10 .
She said , &quot; Would you put them to work ? &quot;
Well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -- it &apos;s hot .
So he gave us each a cotton sack , about 10 feet long , about that big around , and we started picking .
Now , cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers .
And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , your hands are bleeding in no time .
And my brother and I started to pick it , and our hands were startin &apos; to bleed , and then -- &quot; Mom ! &quot;
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this .
She wasn &apos;t going to give up .
Well , the foreman could see he was in over his head , I guess .
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice .
He just sang : &quot; Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
And from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : &quot; Good news , good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
Now , my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . It was so beautiful .
We sat there all day picking cotton , without complaining , without crying , while they sang things like : &quot; Oh , Mary , don &apos;t you weep , don &apos;t you moan &quot; and &quot; Wade in the water , &quot; and &quot; I done done , &quot; &quot; This little light of mine . &quot;
Finally , by the end of the day , we &apos;d each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton .
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar , but my mother would never let us cash it .
I &apos;m 57 ; still have the check .
Now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
But if you have children , you know it doesn &apos;t often work that way .
No , we learned something else .
The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again .
And pretty much never did .
But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day , and that was an eye-opener .
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier .
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can .
Now , I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field .
I wasn &apos;t even aware of music -- not even aware of it .
But that day in the cotton field out there picking , when those people started singing , I realized I was in the very heart of real music , and that &apos;s where I &apos;ve wanted to be ever since .
Try this old song with me . I sing : Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
You sing : Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Good news , good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me -- It &apos;s been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton , isn &apos;t it ?
Let &apos;s try it one more time .
There &apos;s a starry crown in heaven , I know .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
There &apos;s a starry crown in heaven , I know .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
It was a few years ago , but I sort of remembered this story , and I told it at a concert .
My mom was in the audience .
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course , but after the concert she came up and she said , &quot; David , I &apos;ve got to tell you something .
I set that whole thing up .
I set it up with the foreman . I set it up with the owner of the land .
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .
I didn &apos;t know it was going to make you fall in love with music though . &quot;
Let &apos;s try . Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Well , this is the steel guitar . It &apos;s an American-made instrument .
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers , who later on made the Dobro , which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from .
It &apos;s usually played flat on your lap .
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s , before they had electric guitars , trying to make a loud guitar .
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck , just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well .
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .
Break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes .
This instrument pretty much saved my life .
Fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , I guess , this year , my wife and I lost our daughter , Sarah Jane , in a car accident , and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world .
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive .
I had to sit down and make lists , because I was ready to go ; I was ready to check out of this world .
And you know , at the top of the list , of course , were Jenny , and my son , Zeb , my parents -- I didn &apos;t want to hurt them .
But then , when I thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
I didn &apos;t care about -- I had a radio show , I have a radio show on public radio , &quot; Riverwalk , &quot; I didn &apos;t care about that . I didn &apos;t care about awards or money or anything .
Nothing . Nothing .
On the list it would be stuff like , seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring , the smell of new-mown hay , catching a wave and bodysurfing , the touch of a baby &apos;s hand , the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar , listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon .
And for me , the sound of a steel guitar , because one of my parents &apos; neighbors just gave me one of these things .
And I would sit around with it , and I didn &apos;t know how to play it , but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play .
And it was the only instrument that , of all the ones that I play , that would really make that connection .
This is a song that came out of that .
Well , I hear you &apos;re having trouble .
Lord , I hate to hear that news .
If you want to talk about it , you know , I will listen to you through .
Words no longer say it ; let me tell you what I always do .
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .
People say , &quot; Oh , snap out of it ! &quot;
Oh yeah , that &apos;s easier said than done .
While you can hardly move , they &apos;re running around having all kinds of fun .
Sometimes I think it &apos;s better just to sink way down in your funky mood &apos; til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .
Now , you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes , but you know that &apos;s not going to get you where you want to get .
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose .
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues .
Open up now .
Oh , I think I &apos;ve got time to tell you about this . My dad was an inventor .
We moved to California when Sputnik went up , in 1957 .
And he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney .
They were about my age .
John went on , and Michael did too , to become some of the inventors of computer animation .
Michael &apos;s dad was working on something called the computer .
This was 1957 , I was a little 10-year-old kid ; I didn &apos;t know what that was . But he took me down to see one , you know , what they were making . It was like a library , just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see , just floors and floors of these things , and one of the engineers said , some day you &apos;re going to be able to put this thing in your pocket .
I thought , damn , those are going to be some big pants !
So that Christmas -- maybe I &apos;ve got time for this -- that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set .
Well , I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ; so did Michael .
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney , the inventor of the cotton gin .
So we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set .
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see : sulfur , potassium nitrate and charcoal .
Man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made gunpowder .
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew , it flared up . Ah , it was great .
Well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon .
So we went over into Michael &apos;s garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff , and we put a pipe in the vice there , and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe , drilled a hole in the back of the pipe , took some of our firecrackers , pulled out the fuses , tied them together , put them in the back there , and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top , in the garage .
We weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
We stood back , we lit that thing , and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper .
Through the garage .
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen .
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
That was Pacific Palisades ; it probably is still there , back there .
Well , my brother heard that we had made gunpowder .
He and his buddies , they were older , and they were pretty mean .
They said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gunpowder for them .
We said , well , what are you going to do with it ?
They said , we &apos;re going to melt it down and make rocket fuel .
Sure . We &apos;ll make you a big batch .
So we made them a big batch , and it was in my -- now , we &apos;d just moved here . We &apos;d just moved to California .
Mom had redone the kitchen ; Mom was gone that day . We had a pie tin .
It became Chris Berquist &apos;s job to do the melting down .
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen .
He said , &quot; Yeah , hey , it &apos;s melting . Yeah , the sulfur &apos;s melting .
No problem . Yeah , you know . &quot;
It just flared up , and he turned around , and he looked like this .
No hair , no eyelashes , no nothing .
There were big welts all over my mom &apos;s kitchen cabinet ; the air was the just full of black smoke .
She came home , she took that chemistry set away , and we never saw it again .
But we thought of it often , because every time she &apos;d cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder .
So I like to invent things too , and I think I &apos;ll close out my set with something I invented a good while back .
When drum machines were new , I got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the hambone rhythms , and combine it with the newest technology ?
I call this Thunderwear .
At that time , drum triggers were new .
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit .
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ; I &apos;m going to be doing some of the same ones .
I have a trigger here , trigger here , here , here . Right there .
It &apos;s going to really hurt if I don &apos;t take that off . Okay .
Now , the drum triggers go out my tail here , into the drum machine , and they can make various sounds , like drums .
So let me put them all together . And also , I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this .
Thank you , folks .
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight .
Number one : Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard .
And second , that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world .
And in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and I want to tell you how tonight .
Now , nobody wants an operation .
Who here has had surgery ?
Did you want it ?
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
Nobody wants an operation .
In particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar .
But if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minimally invasive operation .
That &apos;s what I want to talk to you about tonight -- how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator .
Now , this type of surgery is hard , and it starts by putting people to sleep , putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen , blowing them up like a balloon , sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen -- it &apos;s dangerous stuff -- and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen .
So let &apos;s see what it looks like .
So this is gallbladder surgery .
We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone .
This is the real thing . There &apos;s no blood .
And you can see how focused the surgeons are , how much concentration it takes .
You can see it in their faces .
It &apos;s hard to teach , and it &apos;s not all that easy to learn .
We do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
All right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; He &apos;s a born surgeon . &quot;
Let me tell you , surgeons are not born .
Surgeons are not made either .
There are no little tanks where we &apos;re making surgeons .
Surgeons are trained one step at a time .
It starts with a foundation , basic skills .
We build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant .
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training .
And when they do all of that for about five years , they get the coveted board certification .
If you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board-certified surgeon .
You get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice .
And eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve mastery .
Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States , SAGES , started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures .
Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified .
It &apos;s not a lecture , it &apos;s not a course , it &apos;s all of that plus a high-stakes assessment .
It &apos;s hard .
Now just this past year , one of our partners , the American College of Surgeons , teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS -certified before they do minimally invasive surgery .
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada ?
No , we just said all surgeons .
So to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task , something I &apos;m very personally excited about as we travel around the world .
SAGES does surgery all over the world , teaching and educating surgeons .
So we have a problem , and one of the problems is distance .
We can &apos;t travel everywhere .
We need to make the world a smaller place .
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so .
And one of the tools I like personally is using video .
So I was inspired by a friend .
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto .
And he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing .
So here &apos;s Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
Very inspiring .
But for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem .
Even people who say they speak English , only 14 percent pass .
Because for them it &apos;s not a surgery test , it &apos;s an English test .
Let me bring it to you locally .
I work at the Cambridge Hospital .
It &apos;s the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility .
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital .
It &apos;s a big labor-intensive effort .
If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren &apos;t enough translators in the world .
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest .
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week .
And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can &apos;t talk to .
And there isn &apos;t always a translator available .
So we need tools .
We need a universal translator .
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world .
It &apos;s really about setting up a dialogue .
We have a lot to learn .
Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world .
Maybe we have something to learn as well .
So I &apos;m passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world .
This past year I &apos;ve been in Latin America , I &apos;ve been in China , talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
And everywhere I go the barrier is : &quot; We want this , but we need it in our language . &quot;
So here &apos;s what we think we want to do : Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously .
I want to talk to the people in Asia , Latin America , Africa , Europe seamlessly , accurately and in a cost-effective fashion using technology .
And it has to be bi-directional .
They have to be able to teach us something as well .
It &apos;s a big task .
So we looked for a universal translator ; I thought there would be one out there .
Your webpage has translation , your cellphone has translation , but nothing that &apos;s good enough to teach surgery .
Because we need a lexicon . What is a lexicon ?
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain .
I need to have a health care lexicon .
And in that I need a surgery lexicon .
That &apos;s a tall order . We have to work at it .
So let me show you what we &apos;re doing .
This is research -- can &apos;t buy it .
We &apos;re working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator .
It starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing .
But we don &apos;t have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
And now we &apos;ve got the words , and we can apply the special sauce : the translation .
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic .
We work with a fourth technology .
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
And I &apos;d like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don &apos;t necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful .
Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery .
Module five : manual skills practice .
Students may display captions in their native language .
Steven Schwaitzberg : If you &apos;re in Latin America , you click the &quot; I want it in Spanish &quot; button and out it comes in real time in Spanish .
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time , by using technology in a constructive fashion , you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian -- on and on and on , simultaneously without the use of human translators .
But that &apos;s the lectures .
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
The difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much .
So we &apos;re going to take it one step further ; we &apos;ve brought my friend Allan back .
Allan Okrainec : Today we &apos;re going to practice suturing .
This is how you hold the needle .
Grab the needle at the tip .
It &apos;s important to be accurate .
Aim for the black dots .
Orient your loop this way .
Now go ahead and cut .
Very good Oscar . I &apos;ll see you next week .
SS : So that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on in our quest for the universal translator .
We want it to be bi-directional .
We have a need to learn as well as to teach .
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this .
As we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
This is a ubiquitous tool .
In order to break down our barriers , we have to learn to talk to people , to demand that people work on translation .
We need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
Thank you very much .
A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach , I met Harriet .
We &apos;d actually met online before -- not the way you &apos;re thinking .
We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey , one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies .
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda , she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA -- Haplotype K1a1b1a -- which meant that we were distantly related .
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman .
So Ozzie , Harriet and me .
And being the current day , of course , we started our own Facebook group .
You &apos;re all welcome to join .
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference , she &apos;d gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts .
Now why am I telling you this story , and what does this have to do with the future of health ?
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary , exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking .
What I &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
We often think linearly .
But if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day -- two , four , eight , 16 -- in 15 days you have 32,000 .
What do you think you have in a month ? We &apos;re at a billion .
So if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really don &apos;t use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation .
And one of the major things we can do we &apos;ve talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .
We spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life .
What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health , leveraging technology as well ?
Now my favorite technology , example of exponential technology , we all have in our pocket .
So if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
I mean this is the iPhone 4 .
Imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do .
Now , I &apos;ve gained some insight into this .
I &apos;ve been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley .
And we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world .
And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech , artificial intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , space , and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals .
We also have seven-day executive programs .
And coming up next month is actually Future Med , a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .
Now I mentioned the phone .
These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there &apos;s one out of the U.K.
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;d try that yet , but that &apos;s available .
There are all other sorts of applications , merging your phone and diagnostics , for example -- measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that , potentially , to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic .
So let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
Let &apos;s start with faster .
Well it &apos;s no secret that computers , through Moore &apos;s law , are speeding up faster and faster .
We have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
They &apos;re really approaching , in many cases surpassing , the ability of the human mind .
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging .
The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible .
And we &apos;re layering multiple technologies -- PET scans , CT scans and molecular diagnostics -- to find and to seek things at different levels .
Here you &apos;re going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today , reconstructed of Marc Hodosh , the curator of TEDMED .
And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time .
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections , we &apos;re going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective , for example , psychoactive drugs .
The scanners for these are getting small , less expensive and more portable .
And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .
The scan of today takes up about 800 books , or 20 gigabytes .
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte , or 800,000 books .
How do you leverage that information ?
Let &apos;s get personal . I won &apos;t ask who here &apos;s had a colonoscopy , but if you &apos;re over age 50 , it &apos;s time for your screening colonoscopy .
How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick ?
Well now there &apos;s essentially a virtual colonoscopy .
Compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient &apos;s colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
Oh , we might have missed it , but using A.I. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
And this is an example of this paradigm shift .
We &apos;re moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology , wireless and , I would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .
So even my stethoscope is now digital .
And of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
We &apos;re moving , obviously , to the era of the tricorder .
So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope .
These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand .
And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records -- in the United States , we &apos;re still less than 20 percent electronic .
Here in the Netherlands , I think it &apos;s more than 80 percent .
But now that we &apos;re switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , I can access my patients &apos; data from wherever I am just through my mobile device .
And now , of course , we &apos;re in the era of the iPad , even the iPad 2 .
And just last month the first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .
So certainly , the physicians of today , including myself , are completely reliable on these devices .
And as you saw just about a month ago , Watson from IBM beat the two champions in &quot; Jeopardy . &quot;
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years , when we &apos;ve started to apply this cloud-based information , when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done .
Already today , you don &apos;t need to go to your physician in many cases .
Only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient .
We &apos;re now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well , to Cisco that &apos;s developed a very complex health presence system .
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different .
And these are being augmented even by our devices again today .
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way .
Or might we be able to leverage today &apos;s gaming technology , like the Microsoft Kinect , and hack that to enable diagnostics , for example , in diagnosing stroke , using simple motion detection , using hundred-dollar devices .
We can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the RP7 ; if I &apos;m a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital .
These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now .
So imagine we already have wireless scales .
You can step on the scale .
You can Tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs .
A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together .
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices , we can put on a simple patch .
This was developed by colleagues at Stanford , called the iRhythm -- completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity .
Now we &apos;re also in the era , today , of quantified self .
Consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices , like this little FitBit .
I can measure my steps , my caloric outtake .
I can get insight into that on a daily basis .
I can share that with my friends , with my physician .
There &apos;s watches coming out that will measure your heart rate , the Zeo sleep monitors , a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health .
And as we start to integrate this information , we &apos;re going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies , health and wellness .
There &apos;s even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
And I would argue , in the future , we &apos;ll have wearable devices in our clothes , monitoring ourselves 24 / 7 .
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars , your red light might go on -- it won &apos;t say &quot; check engine &quot; though .
It &apos;s going to be &quot; check your body &quot; light , and go in and get it taken care of .
Probably in a few years , you &apos;ll check into your mirror and it &apos;s going to be diagnosing you .
For those of you with kiddos at home , how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ...
too much information , I think , than you might need .
But it &apos;s going to be here .
Now we &apos;ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection .
And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies .
Now we &apos;ve talked about augmenting the patient , to some degree .
How about augmenting the physician ?
We &apos;re now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .
Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality .
So the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
This can be integrated with decisions support .
A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam , for example .
And we &apos;re entering an era of really , truly scarless surgery called NOTES , where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically .
And this is called NOTES , and this is coming -- basically scarless surgery , as mediated by robotic surgery .
Now how about controlling other elements ?
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there &apos;s the era of brain-computer interface , or BCI , where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm .
And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .
Still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who &apos;s lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they &apos;ve had in the past .
So we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
If you haven &apos;t lost a limb -- you &apos;ve had a stroke , for example -- you can wear these augmented limbs .
Or if you &apos;re a paraplegic -- like I &apos;ve visited the folks at Berkley Bionics -- they &apos;ve developed eLEGS .
I took this video last week . Here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .
He &apos;s otherwise completely wheelchair-bound .
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics .
And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we &apos;re going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability , or super-enabling .
This is Aimee Mullins , who lost her lower limbs as a young child , and Hugh Herr , who &apos;s a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident .
And now both of these can climb better , move faster , swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons .
Now how about other exponentials ?
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction , including with huge costs .
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
So a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; Fantastic Voyage , &quot; the iPill .
You can swallow this completely integrated device .
It can take pictures of your GI system , help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract .
We get into even smaller micro-robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can &apos;t do in a much less invasive manner .
Sometimes these might self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality .
On the cardiac side , pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don &apos;t need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them .
And they &apos;re going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely .
These are shrinking even further .
Here &apos;s one that &apos;s in prototyping by Medtronic that &apos;s smaller than a penny .
Artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .
Again , in early trials , but moving into the future .
These are going to be game changing .
Or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?
BlueTooth , WiFi available -- beams back images to your eye .
Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet , it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you .
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ?
In fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .
We can now leverage microfluidics , like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford .
Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians .
Put it on a chip , enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care , anywhere in the world .
And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care .
If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we &apos;re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
Now how about exponentially cheaper ?
Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper .
In genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
We &apos;re now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -- probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome .
What are we going to do with hundred-dollar genomes ?
And soon we &apos;ll have millions of these tests available .
And that &apos;s when it gets interesting , when we start to crowdsource that information .
And we enter the era of true personalized medicine -- the right drug for the right person at the right time -- instead of what we &apos;re doing today , which is the same drug for everybody -- sort of blockbuster drug medications , medications which don &apos;t work for you , the individual .
And many , many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches .
And I &apos;ll also show you a simple example , from 23andMe again .
My data indicates that I &apos;ve got about average risk for developing macular degeneration , a kind of blindness .
But if I take that same data , upload it to deCODEme , I can look at my risk for sample type 2 diabetes .
I &apos;m at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes .
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example .
It might change my behavior .
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics -- how my genes modulate , what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important , and once in the hands of the individual and the patient , will make better drug dosing and selection available .
So again , it &apos;s not just genes , it &apos;s multiple details -- our habits , our environmental exposure .
When was the last time your physician asked you where you &apos;ve lived ?
Geomedicine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health .
We can capture that information .
So genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
Well we &apos;re now entering the era of systems medicine , or systems biology , where we can start to integrate all of this information .
And by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test , we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .
This has been called by Lee Hood , the father of the field , P4 medicine .
We &apos;re going to be predictive ; we &apos;re going to know what you &apos;re likely to have .
We can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly participatory .
Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
So I &apos;ll finish up with exponentially better .
We &apos;d like to get therapies better and more effective .
Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .
What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ?
This is a new device that is essentially doing that .
It should be on the market within a year or two .
How about more targeted therapies for cancer ?
Right , I &apos;m an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison .
We &apos;ve learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells , the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse .
So if you think of cancer as a weed , we often can whack the weed away .
It seems to shrink , but it often comes back .
So we &apos;re attacking the wrong target .
The cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later .
We &apos;re now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure .
And we &apos;re entering the era of personalized oncology , the ability to leverage all of this data together , analyze the tumor and come up with a real , specific cocktail for the individual patient .
Now I &apos;ll close with regenerative medicine .
So I &apos;ve studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
We also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .
Geron , just last year , started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries .
Still a Phase I trial , but evolving .
We &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
I invented a device called the MarrowMiner , a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow .
It &apos;s now been FDA approved , and it &apos;ll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .
Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient &apos;s body and removing the patient &apos;s bone marrow , instead of with 200 punctures , with just a single puncture under local anesthesia .
But where is stem cell therapy really going ?
If you think about it , every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo .
We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines .
And I think they &apos;ll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells , myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future , should you need them .
And we &apos;re integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering , and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing -- replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ .
That &apos;s where things are going to head -- still very early days .
But I think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
So in close , as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine , we &apos;re entering an era of miniaturization , decentralization and personalization .
And I think by pulling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these , we &apos;re going to empower the patient , enable the doctor , enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
Because I know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with Stage I disease , I &apos;m thrilled -- we can often cure them .
But often it &apos;s too late and it &apos;s Stage III or IV cancer , for example .
So by leveraging these technologies together , I think we &apos;ll enter a new era that I like to call Stage 0 medicine .
And as a cancer doctor , I &apos;m looking forward to being out of a job .
Thanks very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Take a bow . Take a bow .
I &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models I work with .
They &apos;re all the perfect size , and they don &apos;t have an ounce of fat .
Did I mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
And they &apos;re scientific models ?
As you might have guessed , I &apos;m a tissue engineer , and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I &apos;ve engineered in the lab .
And one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body .
But what I &apos;m going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models .
Well , let &apos;s think about the drug screening process for a moment .
You go from drug formulation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market .
It costs a lot of money , a lot of time , and sometimes , even when a drug hits the market , it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people .
And the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
It all boils down to two issues . One , humans are not rats , and two , despite our incredible similarities to one another , actually those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us .
So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity ?
Let &apos;s see how we can do it with tissue engineering .
One of the key technologies that &apos;s really important is what &apos;s called induced pluripotent stem cells .
They were developed in Japan pretty recently .
Okay , induced pluripotent stem cells .
They &apos;re a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy .
We induce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , culturing them , and then harvesting them .
So they &apos;re skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
So without the controversy , that &apos;s cool thing number one .
Cool thing number two , you can grow any type of tissue out of them : brain , heart , liver , you get the picture , but out of your cells .
So we can make a model of your heart , your brain on a chip .
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece , and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery .
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we &apos;re developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular , scalable way .
Going forward , imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue .
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip .
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells , let &apos;s say , from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them , we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab .
Here &apos;s an example from Kevin Eggan &apos;s lab at Harvard .
He generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have Lou Gehrig &apos;s Disease , and he differentiated them into neurons , and what &apos;s amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease .
So with disease models like these , we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before , and maybe discover drugs even faster .
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa .
This is a degeneration of the retina .
It &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
So some people think that these models sound well and good , but ask , &quot; Well , are these really as good as the rat ? &quot;
The rat is an entire organism , after all , with interacting networks of organs .
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver , and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat .
Don &apos;t you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models ?
Well , this is another trend in the field .
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics , the field is actually evolving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart .
These systems are really hard to build , but we &apos;re just starting to be able to get there , and so , watch out .
But that &apos;s not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments .
This is an example that you might care about someday , and I hope you never do , because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer .
Wouldn &apos;t you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you &apos;re going to take are going to work on your cancer ?
This is an example from Karen Burg &apos;s lab , where they &apos;re using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments .
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next , and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies .
And so thinking about the models that we &apos;ve just discussed , you can see , going forward , that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path : disease models making for better drug formulations , massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing , reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials , and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all .
Essentially , we &apos;re dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body .
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology , helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster , more cheaply and more effectively .
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing , doesn &apos;t it ?
Thank you .
The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places , and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic , and high deserts and low deserts .
Until about a dozen years ago , when I was really captured by caves , and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction .
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff .
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they &apos;re absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet .
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there , we &apos;re also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .
Particularly Mars , but also Europa , the small , icy moon around Jupiter .
And perhaps , someday , far beyond our solar system itself .
I &apos;m very passionately interested in the human future , on the Moon and Mars particularly , and elsewhere in the solar system .
I think it &apos;s time that we transitioned to a solar system-going civilization and species .
And , as an outgrowth of all of this then , I wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets .
Notably Mars , as a first example .
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do .
Why don &apos;t I have a normal job , a sensible job ?
And then of course , I blame the Soviet Union .
Because in the mid-1950s , when I was a tiny child , they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik , which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin .
And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids .
And I &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
It really caught hold of us , and caught fire , and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now .
Of course , refusing to grow up -- -- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life , but I do a fairly good job of that -- but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you &apos;re interested in , is really critical .
The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life .
And so , life is more valuable than no life .
And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
I &apos;m very interested in Mars , of course , and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars .
And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky , that you would see as a dot , and turned it completely into a landscape , as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen .
And when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend , Steve Schneider , at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , working on global change issues .
We &apos;ve written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis -- whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense , and then , as an outgrowth of that , I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war .
So , wonderful things and grim things .
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes , not just as our home .
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective , to try to then think about the way our planet behaves , as a planet , and with the life that &apos;s on it .
And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history .
We &apos;re getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .
So , back to Mars .
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars ?
Well , sometimes it &apos;s really very hard for us to find each other , even on this planet .
So , finding life on another planet is a non-trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that .
Whether or not you think it &apos;s likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe .
I think , myself , that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .
So , you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen , and then you get helium , and then you get more complicated stuff , and you get planets forming -- and life is a common , planetary-based phenomenon , in my view .
Certainly , in the last 15 years , we &apos;ve seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed , and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found .
And so this is very exciting news .
So , my first bold prediction is that , is that in the universe , life is going to be everywhere .
It &apos;s going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .
And those planetary systems are going to be very common .
So , what about life on Mars ?
Well , if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be , I would &apos;ve probably said , a couple of percent .
And even that was considered outrageous at the time .
I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official , as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars .
Of course , that official is now dead , and I &apos;m not , so there &apos;s a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries .
But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years .
And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information .
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in &apos; 97 , and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency &apos;s Mars Express , has taught us a number of amazing things .
There is sub-surface ice on that planet .
And so where there is water , there is a very high chance of our kind of life .
There &apos;s clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place ‚Äì one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed , and there are these amazing structures called blueberries , which are these little , rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now .
So , with all of these things put together , I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would &apos;ve ever thought .
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars , sometime in its past , is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half .
So this is a very bold statement .
I think it &apos;s there , and I think we need to go look for it , and I think it &apos;s underground .
So the game &apos;s afoot , and this is the game that we play in astro-biology .
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
How do you plan to look for it ?
How do you know it when you find it ?
Because if it &apos;s big and obvious , we would &apos;ve already found it -- it would &apos;ve already bitten us on the foot , and it hasn &apos;t .
So , we know that it &apos;s probably quite cryptic .
Very critically , how do we protect it , if we find it , and not contaminate it ?
And also , even perhaps more critically , because this is the only home planet we have , how do we protect us from it , while we study it ?
So why might it be hard to find ?
Well , it &apos;s probably microscopic , and it &apos;s never easy to study microscopic things , although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth , at much smaller scales than ever before .
But it &apos;s probably hiding , because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment , that makes you yummy , and other things might want to eat you , or consume you .
And so , there &apos;s a game of predator-prey that &apos;s going to be , essentially , universal , really , in any kind of biological system .
It also may be very , very different in its fundamental properties ‚Äì its chemistry , or its size .
We say small , but what does that mean ?
Is it virus-sized ? Is it smaller than that ?
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium ? We don &apos;t know .
And speed of activity , which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms , because they grow very , very slowly .
If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate , within about four or five hours , I would have to see growth .
But the organisms that we work with , from the sub-surface of Earth , very often it &apos;s months -- and in many cases , years -- before we see any growth whatsoever .
So they are , intrinsically , a slower life-form .
But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience , and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know , then we can &apos;t recognize what to look for , or how to plan for it .
So , perspective is everything and , because of the history that I &apos;ve just briefly talked to you about , I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet .
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things .
This is my favorite game on airplanes : where you &apos;re in an airplane and you look out the window , you see the horizon .
I always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
It &apos;s a very simple trick , and I never fail to do it when I &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
Well , this is what we apply to our work .
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in .
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco , in Mexico , and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid .
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite -- minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed -- and it is a completely hostile environment for us .
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear , and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you .
This is regularly several hundred parts per million .
So , it &apos;s a very hazardous environment , with CO as well , and many other gases .
These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special .
Because contrary to what you might think , this is not devoid of life .
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet , anywhere .
It &apos;s bursting with life .
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right , but one of the reasons that we &apos;re interested in them is because they represent , really , the average conditions that we may expect on other planets .
So , this is part of the ability that we have , to try to stretch our imagination , in terms of what we may find in the future .
There &apos;s so much life in this cave , and I can &apos;t even begin to scratch the surface of it with you .
But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites , for obvious reasons .
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old &apos;s nose when he has a cold .
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid , and living at pHs right around zero .
And so , this stuff is like battery acid .
And yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
In fact , there &apos;s so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there &apos;s actually a huge number of cavefish .
And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year , as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration .
This is very unusual for caves .
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad , and this is one of the most famous caves in the world .
It &apos;s 115 miles of mapped passage , it &apos;s pristine , it has no natural opening and it &apos;s a gigantic biological , geo-microbiological laboratory .
In this cave , great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here , and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down .
This stuff is produced biologically .
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through .
They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them .
And every time they do that , they get a tiny little packet of energy .
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use , then , to run their life processes .
Interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals .
And so , the obvious avenue for bio-remediation comes from organisms like this .
These organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates , and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .
So , these are signals that they leave in the rock record .
Well , even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves , which are a by-product of volcanic activity , we find these walls totally covered , in many cases , by these beautiful , glistening silver walls , or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold .
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .
And you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys -- these are gardens of these bacteria .
One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they &apos;re in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria , which is where we get most of our antibiotics .
The sub-surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity .
And these organisms , because they &apos;re very separate from the surface , make a vast array of novel compounds .
And so , the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped , but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet .
So , lava-tube caves-- I &apos;ve just told you about organisms that live here on this planet .
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures .
We can see them .
On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily -- and this is the way these tubes form .
And when they hollow out , then they become habitats for organisms .
These are all over the planet Mars , and we &apos;re busy cataloguing them now .
And so , there &apos;s very interesting cave real estate on Mars , at least of that type .
In order to access these sub-surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
You know , it &apos;s not easy to get into these caves .
It requires crawling , climbing , rope-work , technical rope-work and many other complex human motions in order to access these .
We face the problem of , how can we do this robotically ?
Why would we want to do it robotically ?
Well , we &apos;re going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions .
And then , secondly , getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars , we don &apos;t want to contaminate it .
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary .
And in this case , we &apos;re imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front-end work for us , to protect any potential life that we find .
I &apos;m not going to go through all of these projects now , but we &apos;re involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects , in collaboration with a number of different groups .
I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top .
These are hopping microbot swarms .
I &apos;m working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT , and we have come up with the idea of having little , jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle , which is one of the Dubowsky Lab &apos;s specialties -- are the EPAMs , or artificial muscles .
And these allow them to hop .
They behave with a swarm behavior , where they relate to each other , modeled after insect swarm behavior , and they could be made very numerous .
And so , one can send a thousand of them , as you can see in this upper left-hand picture , a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers .
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them .
If you send a thousand of them , you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission .
And so , that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go .
Now , to wrap this up , I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past .
And perhaps it &apos;s time we started to explore those , in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration .
So , we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study , looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars .
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list , and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction .
So , we &apos;re talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies .
And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars .
And right now we &apos;re in caves , and we &apos;re doing science and recreation , but I think in the future we &apos;ll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies .
Now , my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it &apos;s probably been on the planet , maybe one in two chances .
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied , because we now know , from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth , that there &apos;s material that can be exchanged between those two planets .
One of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as I fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
Did life start here and was it transported there ?
Did it start there and get transported here ?
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century , and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions .
Thank you .
Look , I had second thoughts , really , about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys .
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem , which goes , &quot; The truth will set you free , but first it will piss you off . &quot;
So -- So with that in mind , I &apos;m going to set about trying to do those things here , and talk about dying in the 21st century .
Now the first thing that will piss you off , undoubtedly , is that all of us are , in fact , going to die in the 21st century .
There will be no exceptions to that .
There are , apparently , about one in eight of you who think you &apos;re immortal , on surveys , but -- Unfortunately , that isn &apos;t going to happen .
While I give this talk , in the next 10 minutes , a hundred million of my cells will die , and over the course of today , 2,000 of my brain cells will die and never come back , so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece .
Anyway , the second thing I want to say about dying in the 21st century , apart from it &apos;s going to happen to everybody , is it &apos;s shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us , unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it &apos;s currently on .
So there you go . That &apos;s the truth .
No doubt that will piss you off , and now let &apos;s see whether we can set you free . I don &apos;t promise anything .
Now , as you heard in the intro , I work in intensive care , and I think I &apos;ve kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care . It &apos;s been a ride , man .
This has been fantastic .
We have machines that go ping .
There &apos;s many of them up there .
And we have some wizard technology which I think has worked really well , and over the course of the time I &apos;ve worked in intensive care , the death rate for males in Australia has halved , and intensive care has had something to do with that .
Certainly , a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that .
So we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like &quot; lifesaving . &quot;
I really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don &apos;t .
What we do is prolong people &apos;s lives , and delay death , and redirect death , but we can &apos;t , strictly speaking , save lives on any sort of permanent basis .
And what &apos;s really happened over the period of time that I &apos;ve been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , and &apos; 90s , are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then .
So what &apos;s happening now is there &apos;s been a big shift in the way that people die , and most of what they &apos;re dying of now isn &apos;t as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when I was doing this in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this , and we haven &apos;t really squared with you guys about what &apos;s really happening now , and it &apos;s about time we did .
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when I met this guy .
This guy is called Jim , Jim Smith , and he looked like this .
I was called down to the ward to see him .
His is the little hand .
I was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician .
He said , &quot; Look , there &apos;s a guy down here .
He &apos;s got pneumonia , and he looks like he needs intensive care .
His daughter &apos;s here and she wants everything possible to be done . &quot;
Which is a familiar phrase to us .
So I go down to the ward and see Jim , and his skin his translucent like this .
You can see his bones through the skin .
He &apos;s very , very thin , and he is , indeed , very sick with pneumonia , and he &apos;s too sick to talk to me , so I talk to his daughter Kathleen , and I say to her , &quot; Did you and Jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation ? &quot;
And she looked at me and said , &quot; No , of course not ! &quot;
I thought , &quot; Okay . Take this steady . &quot;
And I got talking to her , and after a while , she said to me , &quot; You know , we always thought there &apos;d be time . &quot;
Jim was 94 .
And I realized that something wasn &apos;t happening here .
There wasn &apos;t this dialogue going on that I imagined was happening .
So a group of us started doing survey work , and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in Newcastle , in the Newcastle area , and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating .
One in a hundred .
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill .
And I realized , of course , this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large .
Now , I work in acute care .
This is John Hunter Hospital .
And I thought , surely , we do better than that .
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die .
And we didn &apos;t find a single record of any preference about goals , treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient .
So we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die , but how we die is actually really important , obviously not just to us , but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards .
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us , and the stress created in families by dying is enormous , and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else , so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you &apos;ve got a choice .
And , if that wasn &apos;t bad enough , of course , all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you , in fact , about one in 10 of you at this point , will die in intensive care .
In the U.S. , it &apos;s one in five .
In Miami , it &apos;s three out of five people die in intensive care .
So this is the sort of momentum that we &apos;ve got at the moment .
The reason why this is all happening is due to this , These are the four ways to go .
So one of these will happen to all of us .
The ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest : sudden death .
It &apos;s quite likely in an audience this size this won &apos;t happen to anybody here .
Sudden death has become very rare .
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn &apos;t happen anymore .
The dying process of those with terminal illness that we &apos;ve just seen occurs to younger people .
By the time you &apos;ve reached 80 , this is unlikely to happen to you .
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer .
The big growth industry are these .
What you die of is increasing organ failure , with your respiratory , cardiac , renal , whatever organs packing up . Each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital , at the end of which , or at some point during which , somebody says , enough is enough , and we stop .
And this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty , and frailty &apos;s an inevitable part of aging , and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability , unfortunately .
Enjoying it so far ?
Sorry , I just feel such a , I feel such a Cassandra here .
What can I say that &apos;s positive ? What &apos;s positive is that this is happening at very great age , now .
We are all , most of us , living to reach this point .
You know , historically , we didn &apos;t do that .
This is what happens to you when you live to be a great age , and unfortunately , increasing longevity does mean more old age , not more youth .
I &apos;m sorry to say that .
What we did , anyway , look , what we did , we didn &apos;t just take this lying down at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere .
We &apos;ve started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could , in fact , involve people much more in the way that things happen to them .
But we realized , of course , that we are dealing with cultural issues , and this is , I love this Klimt painting , because the more you look at it , the more you kind of get the whole issue that &apos;s going on here , which is clearly the separation of death from the living , and the fear ‚Äî Like , if you actually look , there &apos;s one woman there who has her eyes open .
She &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . Can you see that ?
She looks terrified .
It &apos;s an amazing picture .
Anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
Clearly , people didn &apos;t want us to talk about death , or , we thought that .
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government and the local Health Service , we introduced a thing at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices .
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die , and what would they prefer under those circumstances .
They loved it . The families and the patients , they loved it .
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice , and that this is how things should work .
And when they expressed wishes , all of those wishes came true , as it were .
We were able to make that happen for them .
But then , when the funding ran out , we went back to look six months later , and everybody had stopped again , and nobody was having these conversations anymore .
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us , because we thought this was going to really take off .
The cultural issue had reasserted itself .
So here &apos;s the pitch : I think it &apos;s important that we don &apos;t just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that &apos;s where we all want to end up , particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and ICU has less and less and less to offer us .
There has to be a little side road off there for people who don &apos;t want to go on that track .
And I have one small idea , and one big idea about what could happen .
And this is the small idea .
The small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated .
Why can &apos;t we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this ?
There are a couple of things you can do .
One of them is , you can , just ask this simple question . This question never fails .
&quot; In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself , who would you like to speak for you ? &quot;
That &apos;s a really important question to ask people , because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome .
The second thing you can say is , &quot; Have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we &apos;ve got a better idea of what it is we can do ? &quot;
So that &apos;s the little idea .
The big idea , I think , is more political .
I think we have to get onto this .
I suggested we should have Occupy Death .
My wife said , &quot; Yeah , right , sit-ins in the mortuary .
Yeah , yeah . Sure . &quot;
So that one didn &apos;t really run , but I was very struck by this .
Now , I &apos;m an aging hippie .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t think I look like that anymore , but I had , two of my kids were born at home in the &apos; 80s when home birth was a big thing , and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation , so if you just replace all these words of birth , I like &quot; Peace , Love , Natural Death &quot; as an option .
I do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it &apos;s going .
Now , listen , that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia .
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all , I hate euthanasia . I think it &apos;s a sideshow .
I don &apos;t think euthanasia matters .
I actually think that , in places like Oregon , where you can have physician-assisted suicide , you take a poisonous dose of stuff , only half a percent of people ever do that .
I &apos;m more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don &apos;t want to do that .
I think most people don &apos;t want to be dead , but I do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds .
So I &apos;m an opponent of euthanasia , but I do think we have to give people back some control .
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply .
I think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia , not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all .
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders , whom I met when I was a medical student .
She founded the hospice movement .
And she said , &quot; You matter because you are , and you matter to the last moment of your life . &quot;
And I firmly believe that that &apos;s the message that we have to carry forward .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy : social media and the end of gender .
Let me connect the dots .
I &apos;m going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love , or love to hate , are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender .
I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender .
If you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and I think that &apos;s going to change .
Now most media companies -- television , radio , publishing , games , you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .
It &apos;s old-school demographics .
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us .
Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste , that you like certain things .
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .
Age demographics : the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s , when the baby boomers were still young .
Now they &apos;ve aged out of that demographic , but it &apos;s still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don &apos;t even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54 .
In our media environment , it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t even exist .
Now , if you watch &quot; Mad Men , &quot; like I do -- it &apos;s a popular TV show in the States -- Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics , which first came about in the 1960s , where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers .
But psychographics really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
It &apos;s really just been basic demographics .
So I &apos;m at the Norman Lear Center at USC , and we &apos;ve done a lot of research over the last seven , eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad .
And in the last three years , we &apos;ve been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed , and we &apos;ve discovered some very interesting things .
All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them .
But those categories mean even less now than they did before , because with online networking tools , it &apos;s much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes .
We &apos;re able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online .
And we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily .
We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests .
We don &apos;t need a media company to help do this for us .
So the traditional media companies , of course , are paying very close attention to these online communities .
They know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out .
But they &apos;re having a hard time doing it because they &apos;re still trying to use demographics in order to understand them , because that &apos;s how ad rates are still determined .
When they &apos;re monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age , your gender and your income .
They can make some educated guesses .
But they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
That &apos;s easier for them to find out than who you are .
And even though that &apos;s still sort of creepy , there is an upside to having your taste monitored .
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn &apos;t been before .
It had been presumed before .
So when you look online at the way people aggregate , they don &apos;t aggregate around age , gender and income .
They aggregate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories .
I &apos;d much rather know whether you like &quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot; rather than how old you are .
That would tell me something more substantial about you .
Now there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve discovered about social media that &apos;s actually quite surprising .
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
If you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category , women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies .
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites , they truly dominate the social media space , which is a space that &apos;s having a huge impact on old media .
The question is : what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture , and what &apos;s it going to mean for women ?
If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media , then does that mean that women are going to take over global media ?
Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows ?
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ?
Could this be possible , that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape ?
Well , I actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women , because they realize this is important for their business , and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere .
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the &quot; chick flick &quot; and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that Hispanics like certain things , that young people like certain things .
This is far too simplistic .
The future entertainment media that we &apos;re going to see is going to be very data-driven , and it &apos;s going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
So you may be asking , well why is it important that I know what entertains people ?
Why should I know this ?
Of course , old media companies and advertisers need to know this .
But my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it &apos;s probably a good idea that you figure out what they &apos;re passionate about , what amuses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
This is a very important thing to know about people .
I &apos;ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people &apos;s lives .
And I do it not just because it &apos;s fun -- though actually , it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people &apos;s lives -- for instance , on their political beliefs and on their health .
And so , if you have any interest in understanding the world , looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start .
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn &apos;t dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .
Can you even imagine what that looks like ?
I can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
Thank you so much .
So when the White House was built in the early 19th century , it was an open house .
Neighbors came and went . Under President Adams , a local dentist happened by .
He wanted to shake the President &apos;s hand .
The President dismissed the Secretary of State , whom he was conferring with , and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth .
Later , in the 1850s , under President Pierce , he was known to have remarked ‚Äî probably the only thing he &apos;s known for ‚Äî when a neighbor passed by and said , &quot; I &apos;d love to see the beautiful house , &quot; and Pierce said to him , &quot; Why my dear sir , of course you may come in .
This isn &apos;t my house . It is the people &apos;s house . &quot;
Well , when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009 , at the start of the Obama Administration , the White House was anything but open .
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows .
We were running Windows 2000 .
Social media were blocked at the firewall .
We didn &apos;t have a blog , let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today .
I came in to become the head of Open Government , to take the values and the practices of transparency , participation and collaboration , and instill them into the way that we work , to open up government , to work with people .
Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products , like cars and computers , and the more complex the products are a society creates , the more successful the society is over time .
Companies make goods , but governments , they make public goods . They work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads , but we don &apos;t have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity . We don &apos;t have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear , at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way .
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy , what did we do ? We wanted , naturally , to ask public sector employees how we should open up government .
Turns out that had never been done before .
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy , not after the fact , commenting on a rule after it &apos;s written , the way is typically the case , but in advance . There was no legal precedent , no cultural precedent , no technical way of doing this .
In fact , many people told us it was illegal .
Here &apos;s the crux of the obstacle .
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things , really , values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions .
But the way that our institutions are designed , in our rather 18th-century , centralized model , is to channel the flow of values through voting , once every four years , once every two years , at best , once a year . This is a rather anemic and thin way , in this era of social media , for us to actually express our values .
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal , perhaps a little too much .
Then in the 19th century , we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies .
But we &apos;ve centralized these bureaucracies .
We &apos;ve entrenched them . And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else .
We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society , and not limited simply to our institutions .
Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow , that the design of our systems , whether natural or social , channel the flow of whatever runs through them .
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water , and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity , and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree , sometimes even having to route around an obstacle , but to get that nutrition flowing .
The same can be said for our social systems , for our systems of government , where , at the very least , flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is , what &apos;s really broken , and the urgent need that we have , that we all feel today , to redesign the flow of our institutions .
We live in a Cambrian era of big data , of social networks , and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent .
Think about it : What other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &apos;t seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis ?
Sure , we invest plenty in innovation . We invest in broadband and science education and science grants , but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have .
Now , it &apos;s very easy to complain , of course , about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy , and we love to complain about government . It &apos;s a perennial pastime , especially around election time , but the world is complex . We soon will have 10 billion people , many of whom will lack basic resources .
So complain as we might , what actually can replace what we have today ?
What comes the day after the Arab Spring ?
Well , one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks . Right ? Networks like Facebook and Twitter . They &apos;re lean . They &apos;re mean .
You &apos;ve got 3,000 employees at Facebook governing 900 million inhabitants .
We might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
But private communities , private , corporate , privatizing communities , are not bottom-up democracies .
They cannot replace government .
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance .
But social media do teach us something .
Why is Twitter so successful ? Because it opens up its platform .
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it , so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways .
We need to think about how to open up the API of government , and the way that we &apos;re going to do that , the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution -- because we have to maintain those public values , we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks , all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions , to engage in the practice of governance .
We have a precedent for this . Good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
Powerful , practical , palpable model for handing power from government to citizens .
Today we have the opportunity , and we have the imperative , to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions , thousands of new kinds of juries : the citizen jury , the Carrotmob , the hackathon , we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance .
Now , we don &apos;t fully have a picture of what this will look like yet , but we &apos;re seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution , I &apos;d even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern .
Some of it &apos;s very high-tech , and some of it is extremely low-tech , such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan , India , where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls , and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll , who &apos;s actually died , what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere , and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget .
But it &apos;s not just about policing government .
It &apos;s also about creating government .
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding , getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities .
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than Ushahidi .
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008 , this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble , whether it &apos;s after the earthquakes in Haiti , or more recently in Italy .
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them , not simply to supplement existing government institutions , but in many cases , to replace them .
Now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
There &apos;s so many examples I could have picked , and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi . Some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in New Jersey , where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans .
In February , he approached the White House , and said , &quot; I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications , apps , that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services &#91; to &#93; them to do so better . &quot;
February 2012 to June of 2012 , the finalists are announced in the competition .
Can you imagine , in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear , getting anything done in a four-month period of time ?
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time , let alone generate real , palpable innovations that improve people &apos;s lives .
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government , because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today .
In the State of Texas , they regulate 515 professions , from well-driller to florist .
Now , you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas , but do not make a flower arrangement without a license , because that will land you in jail .
So what is Texas doing ? They &apos;re asking you and me , using online policy wikis , to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship , but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives , sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development .
That is a nice sideline of open government .
It &apos;s not only the benefits that we &apos;ve talked about with regard to development . It &apos;s the economic benefits and the job creation that &apos;s coming from this open innovation work .
Sberbank , the largest and oldest bank in Russia , largely owned by the Russian government , has started practicing crowdsourcing , engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations .
Last year they saved a billion dollars , 30 billion rubles , from open innovation , and they &apos;re pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing , not only from banking , but into the public sector .
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data , not simply to make apps , but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government .
So a lot of these innovations are local .
In San Ramon , California , they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR-trained , and then when someone has a heart attack , a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR .
The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive .
&quot; There is a hero in all of us , &quot; is their slogan .
But it &apos;s not limited to the local .
British Columbia , Canada , is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance .
Let me be very clear , and perhaps controversial , that open government is not about transparent government .
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn &apos;t change how government works .
It doesn &apos;t get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives , to solve problems , and it doesn &apos;t change government .
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information .
And transparency , by itself , is not reducing the flow of money into politics , and arguably , it &apos;s not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work .
We &apos;re going to see this evolution really in two phases , I think . The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center .
Starting in 2005 , and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started , I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent , and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity .
Well , what did we do ? We said , we can make a website , we can make an expert network , a social network , that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions .
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia , and now I &apos;m pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal , complete , and total openness , so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation , beginning this year .
The second phase of this evolution ‚Äî Yeah .
They deserve a hand .
The first phase is in getting better information in .
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out .
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre , Brazil .
They &apos;re just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago .
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together , as is Lithuania . When we start to see power over the core functions of government ‚Äî spending , legislation , decision-making ‚Äî then we &apos;re well on our way to an open government revolution .
There are many things that we can do to get us there .
Obviously opening up the data is one , but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities .
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate , like the jury is , but we &apos;re going to need lots more things like it .
And that &apos;s why we need to start with our youngest people .
We &apos;ve heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino , and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos .
When we start by teaching young people that we live , not in a passive society , a read-only society , but in a writable society , where we have the power to change our communities , to change our institutions , that &apos;s when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation , towards this open government movement , towards this open government revolution .
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution .
We don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet .
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections , democracy , these are not really great terms yet .
They &apos;re not fun enough . They &apos;re not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us . But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations , the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED , in clean energy , in clean education , in development , if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled , we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow , then we must all participate , then we must get involved .
We must open up our institutions , and like the leaf , we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic , throughout our culture , to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy , a better tomorrow .
Thank you .
For as long as I can remember , I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean .
And at this age , my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin .
And when I first learned about endangered species , I was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever .
And I wanted to do something to help , but I always wondered , what could one person possibly do to make a difference ?
And it would be 30 years , but I would eventually get the answer to that question .
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill , a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying , &quot; We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released . &quot;
And I could not disagree more .
And in addition , I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life .
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this .
On June 23rd , 2000 , a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town , South Africa , spilling 1,300 tons of fuel , which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins .
Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north .
And these are two of the penguins &apos; main breeding islands .
And exactly six years and three days earlier , on June 20th , 1994 , a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island , oiling 10,000 penguins -- half of which died .
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time , was listed as a threatened species .
And soon , nearly 20,000 penguins were covered with this toxic oil .
And the local seabird rescue center , named SANCCOB , immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .
Now at the time , I was working down the street .
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium .
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday , the phone rang in the penguin office .
And with that call , my life would change forever .
It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB , saying , &quot; Please come help .
We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them . &quot;
So two days later , I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists .
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
In fact , many people compared it to a war zone .
And last week , a 10 year-old girl asked me , &quot; What did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins ? &quot;
And this is what happened .
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .
Penguins are very vocal birds and really , really noisy .
And so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking , but instead , when we stepped through those doors and into the building , it was eerily silent .
So it was very clear these were stressed , sick , traumatized birds .
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers .
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center , and eventually , over the course of this rescue , more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds .
And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there -- yet they were .
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity , this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .
So the day after we arrived , two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two , and room two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it .
Now mind you , three days earlier , we had 60 penguins under our care , so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was .
Personally , I really didn &apos;t know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task .
And collectively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
Because we all knew that just six years earlier , half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived .
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins ?
We just did not know .
But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .
And you may notice they &apos;re wearing very thick gloves .
And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor-sharp beaks .
And before long , our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins .
Now the day after we arrived , a new crisis began to unfold .
The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island , and the rescuers despaired , because they knew if the oil hit , it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds .
And there really were no good solutions .
But then finally , one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea .
He said , &quot; Okay , why don &apos;t we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled &quot; -- they collected 20,000 -- &quot; and we &apos;ll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home . &quot;
So three of those penguins -- Peter , Pamela and Percy -- wore satellite tags , and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home , the oil would be cleaned up from their islands .
And luckily , the day they arrived , it was .
So it had been a huge gamble , but it had paid off .
And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills .
So in wildlife rescue , as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in &apos; 94 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks -- because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once .
So in these six years between these two oil spills , they built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes , and as a result , during the Treasure rescue , just 160 penguins died during the transport process , as opposed to 5,000 .
So this alone was a huge victory .
Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands , using these training boxes .
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue .
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier .
So penguins learn from previous experience , too .
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies .
And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin .
And when you clean a penguin , you first have to spray it with a degreaser .
And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue .
About a year prior to this oil spill , a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser .
And they &apos;d been using it at SANCCOB with great success , so they began using it during the Treasure rescue .
But part way through , they ran out .
So in a panic , Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said , &quot; Please , you have to make more . &quot;
So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds .
So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals .
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins ?
And was Silvia Gaus right ?
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway ?
Well she could not be more wrong .
After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor , more than 90 percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild .
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins , and bred nearly as successfully .
And in addition , about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised .
And again , we know from long-term monitoring that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent-raised chicks .
So , armed with this knowledge , SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project .
And every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks , and they have a very impressive 80 percent success rate .
And this is critically important because , one year ago , the African penguin was declared endangered .
And they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience ?
Personally , I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible .
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference .
Just look at that 17 year-old .
And when we come together and work as one , we can achieve extraordinary things .
And truly , to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge , if you will .
My mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins , but why should any of you care about penguins ?
Well , you should care because they &apos;re an indicator species .
And simply put , if penguins are dying , it means our oceans are dying , and we ultimately will be affected , because , as Sylvia Earle says , &quot; The oceans are our life-support system . &quot;
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .
And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about .
So if we each do our part , together , we can make a difference , and we can help keep penguins from going extinct .
Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins , but we are now their only hope .
Thank you .
Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
All right . One , two , three .
If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
It literally says , &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; Right ?
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful .
Ow ! Ow !
And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
They begin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ?
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
The question &quot; why ? &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
So Amy , would you please come up ?
So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from .
So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so -- well , game -- and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults .
Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do ‚Äî Student : 5C .
Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
&quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
Student : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ?
The one on the left is mine , okay ?
Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
That &apos;s a science paper , basically .
So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; The results section , it says : &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; Right ?
And the methods , it says , &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge , &quot; smiley face . Right ?
This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot;
In other words , it starts off &quot; once upon a time , &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc .
So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; ‚Äî ‚Äî &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; The paper is magnificent .
The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot;
So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
They say no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ?
It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published .
Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
What was the feedback like ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot;
So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ?
Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before .
And you like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ...
Okay .
Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
Audience : Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Everyone over there shout .
Where &apos;s the sound coming from ?
Thank you very much .
What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
So , Amy ?
AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan .
I was covering the war in Afghanistan , and I witnessed , as a reporter for Al Jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that .
Then , two years later , I covered another war -- the war in Iraq .
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq .
And the war ended with a regime change , like the one in Afghanistan .
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship , an authoritarian regime , that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation , within the people themselves .
However , the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world .
For decades , we have lived under authoritarian regimes -- in the Arab world , in the Middle East .
These regimes created something within us during this period .
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
For the last 40 years , I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old , aged , authoritarian , corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us .
And for a moment I was wondering , are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground , a change that does not come through foreign intervention , through the misery of occupation , through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes ?
The Iraqis : yes , they got rid of Saddam Hussein , but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad , they felt that their dignity had suffered .
And this is why they revolted .
This is why they did not accept .
And actually other regimes , they told their citizens , &quot; Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ?
Would you like to see civil war , sectarian killing ?
Would you like to see destruction ?
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot;
And the people thought for themselves , &quot; Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in , instead of having the second scenario . &quot;
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .
For 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of killing , of sectarian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a magnificent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years .
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived .
A new generation , well-educated , connected , inspired by universal values and a global understanding , has created a new reality for us .
We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams : these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world , who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets .
Nothing happened . No violence . Nothing .
Just step out of your house , raise your voice and say , &quot; We would like to see the end of the regime . &quot;
This is what happened in Tunisia .
Over a few days , the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies , billions of dollars in maintaining , trying to maintain , its prisons , collapsed , disappeared , because of the voices of the public .
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill .
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
They found something called Facebook .
They found something called Twitter .
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
And they said , &quot; These kids are misled . &quot;
Therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
This is what they were telling . This is their propaganda .
&quot; Bring these kids home because they are misled . &quot;
But yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it -- not using violence , not trying to create chaos -- these young people , they did not go home .
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them .
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia .
We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years , and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there .
But we found that these people in the street , all of them are our reporters , feeding our newsroom with pictures , with videos and with news .
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority .
And then we took that decision : We are unrolling the news .
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .
We are going to spread the message .
Yes , some of these young people are connected to the Internet , but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from .
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified &#91; it &#93; .
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our English channel .
And then people started to feel that there &apos;s something new happening .
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave .
And then Egypt started , and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave .
And now Libya as you see it .
And then you have Yemen .
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of , &quot; How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant ? &quot;
I want to tell you something , that the Internet and connectivity has created &#91; a &#93; new mindset .
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from .
And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
Always , we believed that change will spring from within , that change should be a reconciliation with culture , cultural diversity , with our faith in our tradition and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside .
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world .
This is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region .
How did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite ?
In front of Facebook , they brought the camels in Tahrir Square .
In front of Al Jazeera , they started creating tribalism .
And then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world .
They started telling the West , &quot; Be aware of Al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories .
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras .
Be aware of these people who &#91; are &#93; coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . &quot;
Fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception .
They could not , and they cannot , imagine how they could really deal with this reality .
They have lost .
They have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution .
We do not create revolutions .
However , when something of that magnitude happens , we are at the center of the coverage .
We were banned from Egypt , and our correspondents , some of them were arrested .
But most of our camera people and our journalists , they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily -- to report what happened in Tahrir Square .
For 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in Tahrir Square .
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don &apos;t know -- from Tahrir Square .
He told me , &quot; We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras .
If you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide .
You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square . &quot;
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them , &quot; Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well . &quot;
So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world .
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world .
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran , of &#91; the &#93; Mosaddeq revolution .
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest , or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security .
The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
Let us accept the choice of the people .
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future .
The future should be ruled by people themselves , even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us .
But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world , for the West and the East , to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world , rather than the images of violence and terrorism .
Let us support these people .
Let us stand for them .
And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change , and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance .
The future has arrived , and the future is now .
I thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
I just have a couple of questions for you .
Thank you for coming here .
How would you characterize the historical significance of what &apos;s happened ?
Is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?
Wadah Khanfar : Actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered .
We have covered many wars .
We have covered a lot of tragedies , a lot of problems , a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spots in the region , because we were centered at the middle of it .
But this is a story -- it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident .
You are witnessing change in history .
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .
And this is what the story &apos;s all about .
There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical , or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos .
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now , that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you &apos;ve spoken about so inspiringly ?
WK : And people actually , after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime , the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils , they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy , but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational , not to go out of order .
In my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties .
At this moment in time , the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes .
We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way .
What should people here at TED , here in the West , do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what &apos;s happening here ?
WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
Mohamed Nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of Aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
Fifty percent of it is coming from America .
Because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our Internet .
Unfortunately in the United States , we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English .
But I can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling , universal feeling , of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us .
Well Wadah , a group of members of the TED community , TEDxCairo , are meeting as we speak .
They &apos;ve had some speakers there .
I believe they &apos;ve heard your talk .
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
Thank you so much .
I &apos;m not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures .
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after I &apos;ll speak .
I must speak to you a little bit of my history , because we &apos;ll be speaking on this during my speech here .
I was born in 1944 in Brazil , in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy .
I was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest &#91; still &#93; .
A marvelous place .
I lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , I swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm , and everything that we produced on this farm , we consumed .
Very few things went to the market .
Once a year , the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced , and we made trips of about 45 days to reach the slaughterhouse , bringing thousands of head of cattle , and about 20 days traveling back to reach our farm again .
When I was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger -- where I did the second part of secondary school .
There I learned different things .
Brazil was starting to urbanize , industrialize , and I knew the politics . I became a little bit radical , I was a member of leftist parties , and I became an activist .
I &#91; went to &#93; university to become an economist .
I &#91; did &#93; a master &apos;s degree in economics .
And the most important thing in my life also happened in this time .
I met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend , and my associate in everything that I have done till now , my wife , L√©lia Wanick Salgado .
Brazil radicalized very strongly .
We fought very hard against the dictatorship , in a moment it was necessary to us : Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand , or leave Brazil . We were too young , and our organization thought it was better for us to go out , and we went to France , where I did a PhD in economics , L√©ila became an architect .
I worked after for an investment bank .
We made a lot of trips , financed development , economic projects in Africa with the World Bank .
And one day photography made a total invasion in my life .
I became a photographer , abandoned everything and became a photographer , and I started to do the photography that was important for me .
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist , that you are an anthropologist photographer , that you are an activist photographer .
But I did much more than that .
I put photography as my life .
I lived totally inside photography doing long term projects , and I want to show you just a few pictures of -- again , you &apos;ll see inside the social projects , that I went to , I published many books on these photographs , but I &apos;ll just show you a few ones now .
In the &apos; 90s , from 1994 to 2000 , I photographed a story called Migrations .
It became a book . It became a show .
But during the time that I was photographing this , I lived through a very hard moment in my life , mostly in Rwanda .
I saw in Rwanda total brutality .
I saw deaths by thousands per day .
I lost my faith in our species .
I didn &apos;t believe that it was possible for us to live any longer , and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus .
I started to have infection everywhere .
When I made love with my wife , I had no sperm that came out of me ; I had blood .
I went to see a friend &apos;s doctor in Paris , told him that I was completely sick .
He made a long examination , and told me , &quot; Sebastian , you are not sick , your prostate is perfect .
What happened is , you saw so many deaths that you are dying .
You must stop . Stop .
You must stop because on the contrary , you will be dead . &quot;
And I made the decision to stop .
I was really upset with photography , with everything in the world , and I made the decision to go back to where I was born .
It was a big coincidence .
It was the moment that my parents became very old .
I have seven sisters . I &apos;m one of the only men in my family , and they made together the decision to transfer this land to L√©ila and myself .
When we received this land , this land was as dead as I was .
When I was a kid , it was more than 50 percent rainforest .
When we received the land , it was less than half a percent rainforest , as in all my region .
To build development , Brazilian development , we destroyed a lot of our forest .
As you did here in the United States , or you did in India , everywhere in this planet .
To build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds , and we didn &apos;t know how to deal with these .
And L√©ila came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
She said , why don &apos;t you put back the rainforest that was here before ?
You say that you were born in paradise .
Let &apos;s build the paradise again .
And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us , and we started . We started to plant , and this first year we lost a lot of trees , second year less , and slowly , slowly this dead land started to be born again .
We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees , only local species , only native species , where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed , and the life started to come back in an incredible way .
It was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park .
We transformed . We gave this land back to nature .
It became a national park .
We created an institution called Instituto Terra , and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere .
Here in Los Angeles , in the Bay Area in San Francisco , it became tax deductible in the United States .
We raised money in Spain , in Italy , a lot in Brazil .
We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil that put money into this project , the government .
And the life started to come , and I had a big wish to come back to photography , to photograph again .
And this time , my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life : us .
I wished to photograph the other animals , to photograph the landscapes , to photograph us , but us from the beginning , the time we lived in equilibrium with nature .
And I went . I started in the beginning of 2004 , and I finished at the end of 2011 .
We created an incredible amount of pictures , and the result -- L√©lia did the design of all my books , the design of all my shows . She is the creator of the shows .
And what we want with these pictures is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live , to have some equilibrium in our life .
And I wanted to see us when we used , yes , our instruments in stone .
We exist yet . I was last week at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation , and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups of Indians that are not contacted yet .
We must protect the forest in this sense .
And with these pictures , I hope that we can create information , a system of information .
We tried to do a new presentation of the planet , and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project , please .
Well , this ‚Äî ‚Äî Thank you . Thank you very much .
This is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now .
But there is another part that we must together rebuild , to build our societies , our modern family of societies , we are at a point where we cannot go back .
But we create an incredible contradiction .
To build all this , we destroy a lot .
Our forest in Brazil , that antique forest that was the size of California , is destroyed today 93 percent .
Here , on the West Coast , you &apos;ve destroyed your forest .
Around here , no ? The redwood forests are gone .
Gone very fast , disappeared .
Coming the other day from Atlanta , here , two days ago , I was flying over deserts that we made , we provoked with our own hands .
India has no more trees . Spain has no more trees .
And we must rebuild these forests .
That is the essence of our life , these forests .
We need to breathe . The only factory capable to transform CO2 into oxygen , are the forests .
The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , are the trees .
I put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in Norway .
A lack of oxygen in the water .
I put to myself the question , if for a moment , we will not lack oxygen for all animal species , ours included -- that would be very complicated for us .
For the water system , the trees are essential .
I &apos;ll give you a small example that you &apos;ll understand very easily .
You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head , if you take a shower , it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don &apos;t use a dryer machine .
Me , one minute , it &apos;s dry . The same with the trees .
The trees are the hair of our planet .
When you have rain in a place that has no trees , in just a few minutes , the water arrives in the stream , brings soil , destroying our water source , destroying the rivers , and no humidity to retain .
When you have trees , the root system holds the water .
All the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
This is the most important thing , when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life .
I want to show you now , to finish , just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction .
You remember that I told you , when I received the farm from my parents that was my paradise , that was the farm .
Land completely destroyed , the erosion there , the land had dried .
But you can see in this picture , we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil .
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture .
In each point of those spots , we had planted a tree .
There are thousands of trees .
Now I &apos;ll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago .
I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem .
And I &apos;ll show you the last picture .
We are with two million trees in the ground now .
We are doing the sequestration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees .
My friends , it &apos;s very easy to do . We did it , no ?
By an accident that happened to me , we went back , we built an ecosystem .
We here inside the room , I believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in Brazil , we can transplant it here .
We can apply it everywhere around the world , no ?
And I believe that we can do it together .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s really quite an honor to be here tonight , and I &apos;m really glad that I stayed here and listened because I &apos;ve really been inspired .
And I &apos;m going to play some songs for you tonight that are , literally , world premieres .
I &apos;ve been working on my new record and I &apos;ve never played these songs for anybody except the microphone .
This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology , which goes perfectly with this gathering .
I started thinking about -- when I was in college , especially as a blind person , doing a research paper was a major undertaking .
You had to go to the library , see if you could get them to find the books for you , you know , footnotes and all that .
Now you can just go on Google . Just look it up .
I wish I had that when I was in college .
Anyway , this is a song about : we have all this , but what are we going to do with it ?
It &apos;s called &quot; All the Answers . &quot;
What is the weather in Cincinnati ? What is the time in Tokyo ? Who is this little child &apos;s daddy ? And who the hell needs to know ? Why do memories of you linger when I &apos;m trying to reach my goal ? And why must I move my fingers to the music in my soul ? I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have to know . &apos; Cause here I go ... and I got all the answers right here in my hand . And I got all the answers and I don &apos;t have to understand &apos; cause I got all the answers . Think I &apos;ll rummage through the century while I listen to the sea . Oh , it &apos;s good to be so free , so free . Who was mayor of Chicago back in 1964 ? And why did Shakespeare create Iago to tear apart a love so pure ? How can my dreams be so vivid in a psychosonic way ? Why must I become so livid about the news I hear today ? I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have to know . And here I go ... &apos; cause I got all the answers right here in my hand . And I got all the answers . See , I don &apos;t have to understand &apos; cause I got all the answers . I think I &apos;ll browse on through the tabloid news while I sip my tea . Mm , it &apos;s good to be so free . I never ever have to be alone . I can do it all right here in my home . Yeah , mm-hmm ... Everything that &apos;s ever been known , I can punch it up right here on my phone . Freedom train , coming soon right here in my living room from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon and all points in between . &apos; Cause I got all the answers right here on my screen . And I got all the answers , yeah . I got every book and magazine . I got all , I got all , I got all ... I got all the answers , all the answers , oh yeah . Uh-huh ... But I tell you what I &apos;m going to do : I &apos;m going to find the capitol of Peru or the latitude of Kathmandu . I &apos;m gonna Google it &apos; cause everybody &apos;s doing it . And then I &apos;ll rummage through the century . I got all , I got all , I got all ... I got all the answers . Yeah , yeah I got all the answers . Thank you .
Whew ! It &apos;s a miracle I didn &apos;t make any mistakes on that song .
That &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever played it .
It &apos;s a &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; kind of thing .
This next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream .
It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record , except there &apos;s a couple of problems .
One thing is , it &apos;s unpronounceable .
And it &apos;s a made-up word .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tembererana . &quot;
And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
So &quot; tembererana &quot; was these dreams , in which I would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it .
So this is called &quot; Tembererana . &quot;
It &apos;s based on an Argentinian rhythm called &quot; carnivalito . &quot;
A dream within a dream , a world within a world , the sound of a primal scream travels out across the land . Images flickering , the sound of the war machine , a procession of limousines travels slowly across the land . Another child could use a hand . Reaching out from within tembererana , hey , tembererana ... Annihilation moves . The earth is an open tomb . The sound of the final boom rumbles fiercely across the land . Fear , you &apos;re the enemy . Obliterating all but thee . You see what you want to see . Before I &apos;m blinded , I will toast the shade of power that I love most , the power of creation . Tembererana , hey , tembererana ... Da , da , da , da Da , da , da , da , da , da , da As a child , alone and afraid , escaping the impressions every feeling made , I would run , run away into a world where the good was the aim of the game and the sum of invisible power had a name . It &apos;s the same name . Tembererana , hey , tembererana ... Da , da , da , da , da , da , da Tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana Tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana , hey Tembererana , hey Tembererana ...
My name is Ursus Wehrli , and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project , Tidying Up Art .
First of all -- any questions so far ?
First of all , I have to say I &apos;m not from around here .
I &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
I mean , I &apos;m wearing a tie , first . And then secondly , I &apos;m a little bit nervous because I &apos;m speaking in a foreign language , and I want to apologize in advance , for any mistakes I might make .
Because I &apos;m from Switzerland , and I just don &apos;t hope you think this is Swiss German I &apos;m speaking now here . This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American .
But don &apos;t worry -- I don &apos;t have trouble with English , as such .
I mean , it &apos;s not my problem , it &apos;s your language after all .
I am fine . After this presentation here at TED , I can simply go back to Switzerland , and you have to go on talking like this all the time .
So I &apos;ve been asked by the organizers to read from my book .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tidying Up Art &quot; and it &apos;s , as you can see , it &apos;s more or less a picture book .
So the reading would be over very quickly .
But since I &apos;m here at TED , I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way , in the spirit of TED here , and I managed to do some slides here for you .
I &apos;d like to show them around so we can just , you know -- Actually , I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better .
So Tidying Up Art , I mean , I have to say , that &apos;s a relatively new term .
You won &apos;t be familiar with it .
I mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that I &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the American artist , Donald Baechler I had hanging at home . I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .
Yeah , I kind of felt sorry for him .
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
So I decided to give him a little support , and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other .
Yeah . And I think he looks now less miserable .
And it was great . With this experience , I started to look more closely at modern art . Then I realized how , you know , the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy .
And I can show here a very good example .
It &apos;s actually a simple one , but it &apos;s a good one to start with .
It &apos;s a picture by Paul Klee .
And we can see here very clearly , it &apos;s a confusion of color .
Yeah . The artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to put the different colors .
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured .
We don &apos;t know , maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry , I mean -- -- maybe he had to catch a plane , or something .
We can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture .
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original : 17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares .
Yeah , that &apos;s great .
So I mean , that &apos;s just tidying up for beginners .
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced .
What can you say ? What a mess .
I mean , you see , everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space .
If my room back home had looked like this , my mother would have grounded me for three days .
So I &apos;d like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture .
And that &apos;s really advanced tidying up .
Yeah , you &apos;re right . Sometimes people clap at this point , but that &apos;s actually more in Switzerland .
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese . Our trains run on time .
We are only happy when things are in order .
But to go on , here is a very good example to see .
This is a picture by Joan Miro .
And yeah , we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background .
And yeah , it &apos;s the sort of thing you produce when you &apos;re doodling on the phone .
And this is my -- -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
It &apos;s more economical and also more efficient .
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture .
But I can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this , I brought along the patents , the specifications for some of these works , because I &apos;ve had my working methods patented at the Eidgen√∂ssische Amt f√ºr Geistiges Eigentum in Bern , Switzerland .
I &apos;ll just quote from the specification .
&quot; Laut den Kunstpr√ºfer Dr. Albrecht -- &quot; It &apos;s not finished yet .
&quot; Laut den Kunstpr√ºfer Dr. Albrecht G√∂tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch√ºtzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger√§umte Regelm√§ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m√∂glich wird . &quot;
Ja , well I could have translated that , but you would have been none the wiser .
I &apos;m not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway .
I just realized it &apos;s important how one introduces new ideas to people , that &apos;s why these patents are sometimes necessary .
I would like to do a short test with you .
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning .
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand . Yeah .
The right hand is the one we write with , apart from the left-handers .
And now , I &apos;ll count to three . I mean , it still looks very orderly to me .
Now , I &apos;ll count to three , and on the count of three I &apos;d like you all to shake hands with the person behind you . OK ?
One , two , three .
You can see now , that &apos;s a good example : even behaving in an orderly , systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
This is a painting by the artist , Niki de Saint Phalle .
And I mean , in the original it &apos;s completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict .
But in the tidied up version , it &apos;s plain to see that it &apos;s a sunburnt woman playing volleyball .
Yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
That &apos;s a picture by Keith Haring .
I think it doesn &apos;t matter .
So , I mean , this picture has not even got a proper title .
It &apos;s called &quot; Untitled &quot; and I think that &apos;s appropriate .
So , in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop .
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically .
One can see here quite clearly , you can see we have 25 pale green elements , of which one is in the form of a circle .
Or here , for example , we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve .
I mean , that &apos;s interesting . One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring &apos;s various works , in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares .
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he &apos;s likely to need in the future .
One can obviously also make combinations .
For example , with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky &apos;s dots .
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee .
In the end , one has a list with which one then can arrange .
Then you categorize it , then you file it , put that file in a filing cabinet , put it in your office and you can make a living doing it .
Yeah , from my own experience . So I &apos;m -- Actually , I mean , here we have some artists that are a bit more structured . It &apos;s not too bad .
This is Jasper Johns . We can see here he was practicing with his ruler .
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline .
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
And here , that &apos;s one of my favorites .
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun .
You know , there is a -- I &apos;m always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this .
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels .
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy , five-star hotel .
And you know , there you had this little sign -- I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read , &quot; Please tidy room . &quot; I don &apos;t know if you have them over here .
So actually , my room there hasn &apos;t been tidied once daily , but three times a day .
So after a while I decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day I &apos;d scatter a few things around the space .
Like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . And it was great .
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place .
But then one morning , I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh .
And you have to say this room hadn &apos;t been tidied up since 1888 .
And when I returned it looked like this .
Yeah , at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming .
OK , I mean , I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn &apos;t been properly tidied up . So we can make a short test with you .
This is a picture by Rene Magritte , and I &apos;d like you all to inwardly -- like in your head , that is -- to tidy that up . So it &apos;s possible that some of you would make it like this .
Yeah ? I would actually prefer to do it more this way .
Some people would make apple pie out of it .
But it &apos;s a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements .
And it &apos;s not done , as many people imagine , with the computer , otherwise it would look like this .
So now I &apos;ve been able to tidy up pictures that I &apos;ve wanted to tidy up for a long time .
Here is a very good example . Take Jackson Pollock , for example .
It &apos;s -- oh , no , it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a really hard one .
But after a while , I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
Or you could go into three-dimensional art .
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim .
Here I just brought it back to its original state .
But yeah , and it &apos;s great , you can even go , you know -- Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art .
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels .
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up .
So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method , Georges Seurat , and I collected together all his dots .
And now they &apos;re all in here .
You can count them afterwards , if you like .
You see , that &apos;s the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea : it &apos;s new . So there is no existing tradition in it .
There is no textbooks , I mean , not yet , anyway .
I mean , it &apos;s &quot; the future we will create . &quot;
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more .
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel .
That &apos;s how it looks like when you send everyone home .
Yeah , maybe you &apos;re asking yourselves where old Bruegel &apos;s people went ?
Of course , they &apos;re not gone . They &apos;re all here .
I just piled them up .
So I &apos;m -- yeah , actually I &apos;m kind of finished at that moment .
And for those who want to see more , I &apos;ve got my book downstairs in the bookshop .
And I &apos;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
But before leaving I would like to show you , I &apos;m working right now on another -- in a related field with my tidying up art method . I &apos;m working in a related field .
And I started to bring some order into some flags .
Here -- that &apos;s just my new proposal here for the Union Jack .
And then maybe before I leave you ...
yeah , I think , after you have seen that I have to leave anyway .
Yeah , that was a hard one . I couldn &apos;t find a way to tidy that up properly , so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler .
Thank you very much .
As the highest military commander of The Netherlands , with troops stationed around the world , I &apos;m really honored to be here today .
When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue , I see a very special audience .
You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today .
When I look around , I see people who want to make a contribution , I see people who want to make a better world , by doing groundbreaking scientific work , by creating impressive works of art , by writing critical articles or inspiring books , by starting up sustainable businesses .
And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world .
Some chose the microscope as their instrument .
Others chose dancing or painting or making music like we just heard .
Some chose the pen .
Others work through the instrument of money .
Ladies and gentlemen , I made a different choice .
Thanks .
Ladies and gentlemen -- I share your goals .
I share the goals of the speakers you heard before .
I did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
I chose this instrument .
I chose the gun .
For you , and you heard already , being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy .
It may even feel scary .
A real gun at a few feet &apos;s distance .
Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness .
You could even hear it .
Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun .
It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country .
The Netherlands is not at war .
It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets .
Guns are not a part of our lives .
In many countries it is a different story .
In many countries people are confronted with guns .
They are oppressed .
They are intimidated -- by warlords , by terrorists , by criminals .
Weapons can do a lot of harm .
They are the cause of much distress .
Why then am I standing before you with this weapon ?
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?
Today I want to tell you why .
Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world .
And I want to tell you how this gun can help .
My story starts in the city of Nijmegen in the east of The Netherlands , the city where I was born .
My father was a hardworking baker , but when he had finished work in the bakery , he often told me and my brother stories .
And most of the time , he told me this story I &apos;m going to share with you now .
The story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War .
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands .
Their grim plans were evident .
They meant to rule by means of repression .
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans .
Only brute force remained .
It was our last resort .
My father was there to provide it .
As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt , my father was an excellent marksman .
When he aimed , he never missed .
At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned near the city of Nijmegen .
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country , his country , our country .
He fired . Nothing happened .
He fired again .
No German soldier fell to the ground .
My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank .
Hitler &apos;s troops marched on , and there was nothing my father could do about it .
Until the day my father died , he was frustrated about missing these shots .
He could have done something .
But with an old gun , not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark .
So this story stayed with me .
Then in high school , I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn &apos;t know .
They liberated my birth town .
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun -- for those men and women who came to liberate us -- from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil .
I took up the gun -- not to shoot , not to kill , not to destroy , but to stop those who would do evil , to protect the vulnerable , to defend democratic values , to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place .
Ladies and gentlemen , I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons .
I do not like guns .
And once you have been under fire yourself , it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about .
I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability .
The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .
Now this may sound contradictory to you .
But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon , Sarajevo and &#91; unclear &#93; national as The Netherlands &apos; chief of defense , this is also supported by cold , hard statistics .
Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years .
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace .
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages .
And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War .
Statistics show that we are living Why ?
Why has violence decreased ?
Has the human mind changed ?
Well we were talking on the human mind this morning .
Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge , for violent rituals , for pure rage ?
Or is there something else ?
In his latest book , Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly legitimized by a democratically elected government , legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system .
In other words , a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control .
Such a state monopoly on violence , first of all , serves as a reassurance .
It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies .
Secondly , the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further .
Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war .
Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel .
It enhances peace even further .
Where there is no conflict , trade flourishes .
And trade is another important incentive against violence .
With trade , there &apos;s mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties .
And when there is mutual gain , both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war .
War is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces .
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .
We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so .
It is this legitimate , controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to the statistics of war , conflict and violence around the globe .
It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars .
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous .
Failed states have no legitimized , democratically controlled use of force .
Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability .
That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict .
That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions .
That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan .
That is why we train police officers , we train judges , we train public prosecutors around the world .
and in The Netherlands , we are very unique in that -- that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .
Ladies and gentlemen , looking at this gun , we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind .
Every day I hope that politicians , diplomats , development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope .
And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .
But until that day comes , we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle .
Until that day comes , I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun .
I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us .
I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg , which was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan .
Ladies and gentlemen , until the day comes when we can do away with the gun , I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge .
It takes hard work , often behind the scenes .
It takes good equipment and well-trained , dedicated soldiers .
I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun , instead of the bad gun my father was given .
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there , when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .
They put their lives on the line , for us , for you , and we cannot let them down .
I hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun .
Because she wants a better world .
Because she makes an active contribution to the better world , just like all of us here today .
Thank you very much .
You know , we wake up in the morning , you get dressed , put on your shoes , you head out into the world .
You plan on coming back , getting undressed , going to bed , waking up , doing it again , and that anticipation , that rhythm , helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives , and gives it a measure of predictability .
Living in New York City , as I do , it &apos;s almost as if , with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters , it &apos;s almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck .
You &apos;re never , there &apos;s just , juxtapositions are possible that just aren &apos;t , you don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to happen .
And you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
And one night , I &apos;m riding the uptown local train .
I get on . I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway .
I &apos;m not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book .
And I get on the car , and I look , and I notice this couple , college-aged , student-looking kids , a guy and a girl , and they &apos;re sitting next to each other , and she &apos;s got her leg draped over his knee , and they &apos;re doing -- they have this little contraption , and they &apos;re tying these knots , and they &apos;re doing it with one hand , they &apos;re doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly , and then she &apos;ll hand the thing to him and he &apos;ll do it .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
It &apos;s almost like they &apos;re practicing magic tricks .
And at the next stop , a guy gets on the car , and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him .
He &apos;s got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches , and ‚Äî ‚Äî he looks at them , and then in a blink of an eye , he kneels down in front of them , and he starts to say , &quot; You know , listen , here &apos;s how you can do it . Look , if you do this -- &quot; and he takes the laces out of their hand , and instantly , he starts tying these knots , and even better than they were doing it , remarkably .
And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he &apos;s the guy giving the lecture .
So he starts to tell them , and he &apos;s like , &quot; No , this is very important here . You know , when you &apos;re needing these knots , it &apos;s going to be , you know , everything &apos;s going to be happening at the same time , it &apos;s going to be -- you &apos;re going to have all this information coming at you , there &apos;s going to be organs getting in the way , it &apos;s going to be slippery , and it &apos;s just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature , each hand , left hand , right hand , you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers . &quot;
And at that moment , when I heard that , I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent &apos;s Hospital in Manhattan , and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn .
As part of an initiation for three of their members , they had to kill somebody , and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night , and they jumped on me without a word .
One of the very lucky things , when I was at Notre Dame , I was on the boxing team , so I put my hands up right away , instinctively .
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade , and he went in under my elbow , and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava .
If you know anything about anatomy , that &apos;s not a good thing to get cut , and everything , of course , on the way up , and then ‚Äî I still had my hands up ‚Äî he pulled it out and went for my neck , and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck , and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out .
The other guy was still working on me , collapsing my other lung , and I managed to , by hitting that guy , to get a minute .
I ran down the street and collapsed , and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming .
And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision , so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision , and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent &apos;s , and we &apos;re racing down this hallway , and I see the lights going , and it &apos;s a peculiar effect of memories like that .
They don &apos;t really go to the usual place that memories go .
They kind of have this vault where they &apos;re stored in high-def , and George Lucas did all the sound effects .
So sometimes , remembering them , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s not like any other kind of memories .
And I get into the trauma room , and they &apos;re waiting for me , and the lights are there , and I &apos;d been able to breathe a little more now , because the blood has left , had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing , but now it &apos;s kind of gone into the stretcher .
And I said , &quot; Is there anything I can do to help ? &quot;
and ‚Äî ‚Äî the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh , and I &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh , and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me , and I think , &quot; He looks Bangladeshi , &quot; ‚Äî ‚Äî and I just have those two facts , and I just think , &quot; This could work somehow . &quot;
And then I go out , and they work on me for the rest of the night , and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there while they did their work , and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines , my cecum , organs I didn &apos;t know that I had , and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me , which I thought was great , you know , just a little tidy thing there at the end .
And I came to in the morning .
Out of anesthetic , he had let them know that he wanted to be there , and he had given me about a two percent chance of living .
So he was there when I woke up , and it was , waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain .
It was that enveloping , and there was only one spot that didn &apos;t hurt worse than anything I &apos;d ever felt , and it was my instep , and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb .
And I looked up , and he &apos;s like , &quot; Good to see you , &quot; and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything , and the pain was just overwhelming , and he said , &quot; You know , we didn &apos;t cut your hair . I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson , and you &apos;re going to need all the strength you can get . &quot;
And in those days , my hair was down to my waist , I drove a motorcycle , I was unmarried , I owned a bar , so those were different times .
But I had three days of life support , and everybody was expecting , due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn &apos;t going to make it , so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop , and ‚Äî ‚Äî when I finally pooped , then that somehow , surgically speaking , that &apos;s like you crossed some good line , and , um ‚Äî ‚Äî on that day , the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me .
He had three or four friends with him , and he does that , and they all look , and there was no infection , and they bend over me and they &apos;re poking and prodding , and they &apos;re like , &quot; There &apos;s no hematomas , blah blah , look at the color , &quot; and they &apos;re talking amongst themselves and I &apos;m , like , this restored automobile that he &apos;s just going , &quot; Yeah , I did that . &quot;
And it was just , it was amazing , because these guys are high-fiving him over how good I turned out , you know ?
And it &apos;s my zipper , and I &apos;ve still got the staples in and everything .
And later on , when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time , I went back to him and I was sort of asking him , you know , what am I gonna do ?
And I think , kind of , as a surgeon , he basically said , &quot; Kid , I saved your life .
Like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you gotta get on with that .
It &apos;s like I gave you a new car and you &apos;re complaining about not finding parking .
Like , just , go out , and , you know , do your best .
But you &apos;re alive . That &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
And then I hear , &quot; Bing-bong , &quot; and the subway doors are closing , and my stop is next , and I look at these kids , and I go , I think to myself , &quot; I &apos;m going to lift my shirt up and show them , &quot; ‚Äî ‚Äî and then I think , &quot; No , this is the New York City subway , that &apos;s going to lead to other things . &quot;
And so I just think , they got their lecture to go to .
I step off , I &apos;m standing on the platform , and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got , from my umbilical cord , and then around that , is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon , and I think that , that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team , and their training and their skill and , always , a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos .
Thank you .
Thank you . Very lucky to be here . Thank you .
When I was about 16 years old I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation , looking for a movie to watch on HBO -- and how many of you remember &quot; Ferris Bueller &apos;s Day Off &quot; ?
Oh yeah , great movie , right ? -- Well , I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen , and so I thought , &quot; Sweet ! Ferris Bueller . I &apos;ll watch this ! &quot;
It wasn &apos;t Ferris Bueller . And forgive me Matthew Broderick , I know you &apos;ve done other movies besides Ferris Bueller , but that &apos;s how I remember you ; you &apos;re Ferris .
But you weren &apos;t doing Ferris-y things at the time ; you were doing gay things at the time .
He was in a movie called &quot; Torch Song Trilogy . &quot;
And &quot; Torch Song Trilogy &quot; was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love .
Love and respect -- that &apos;s what the whole film was about .
And as I &apos;m watching it , I &apos;m realizing that they &apos;re talking about me .
Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part .
The finding love and respect , the part about trying to find your place in the world .
So as I &apos;m watching this , I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
And there &apos;s this quote that the main character , Arnold , tells his mother as they &apos;re fighting about who he is and the life that he lives .
&quot; There &apos;s one thing more -- there &apos;s just one more thing you better understand .
I &apos;ve taught myself to sew , cook , fix plumbing , build furniture , I can even pat myself on the back when necessary , all so I don &apos;t have to ask anyone for anything .
There &apos;s nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect , and anyone who can &apos;t give me those two things has no place in my life . &quot;
I remember that scene like it was yesterday ; I was 16 , I was in tears , I was in the closet , and I &apos;m looking at these two people , Ferris Bueller and some guy I &apos;d never seen before , fighting for love .
When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was , and was really quite happy , to tell you the truth , I was happily gay and I guess that &apos;s supposed to be right because gay means happy too .
I realized there were a lot of people who weren &apos;t as gay as I was -- gay being happy , not gay being attracted to the same sex .
In fact , I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle .
Now , I &apos;m sitting here trying to figure out &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again : lifestyle , lifestyle , lifestyle .
I &apos;ve even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism .
That &apos;s when I got scared .
Because I &apos;m thinking , if I &apos;m gay and I &apos;m doing something that &apos;s going to destroy civilization , I need to figure out what this stuff is , and I need to stop doing it right now .
So , I took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and I saw some things very disturbing .
And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I &apos;ve been doing with you , starting with my mornings .
I drink coffee .
Not only do I drink coffee , I know other gay people who drink coffee .
I get stuck in traffic -- evil , evil traffic .
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports .
I look around , and I go , &quot; My God , look at all these gay people !
We &apos;re all trapped in these lines ! These long lines trying to get on an airplane !
My God , this lifestyle that I &apos;m living is so freaking evil ! &quot;
I clean up . This is not an actual photograph of my son &apos;s room ; his is messier .
And because I have a 15-year-old , all I do is cook and cook and cook .
Any parents out there of teenagers ? All we do is cook for these people -- they eat two , three , four dinners a night -- it &apos;s ridiculous !
This is the gay lifestyle .
And after I &apos;m done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic , my partner and I , we get together and we decide that we &apos;re gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun .
We &apos;re usually in bed before we find out who &apos;s eliminated on &quot; American Idol . &quot;
We have to wake up and find out the next day who &apos;s still on because we &apos;re too freaking tired to hear who stays on .
This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle .
Run for your heterosexual lives , people .
When my partner , Steve , and I first started dating , he told me this story about penguins .
And I didn &apos;t know where he was going with it at first .
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me , but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with , they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble .
And then he reaches into his pocket , and he brings this out to me .
And I looked at it , and I was like , this is really cool .
And he says , &quot; I want to spend the rest of my life with you . &quot;
So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous , like , I don &apos;t know , a TEDx talk .
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time .
And sometimes I just wear it just because .
How many people out there are in love ? Anyone in love out there ?
You might be gay .
Because I , too , am in love , and apparently that &apos;s part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about .
You may want to tell your spouse . Who , if they &apos;re in love , might be gay as well .
How many of you are single ? Any single people out there ?
You too might be gay ! Because I know some gay people who are also single .
It &apos;s really scary , this gay lifestyle thing ; it &apos;s super duper evil and there &apos;s no end to it !
It goes and goes and engulfs !
It &apos;s really quite silly , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say that he supports -- that he supports marriage equality .
It &apos;s a wonderful day in our country &apos;s history ; it &apos;s a wonderful day in the globe &apos;s history to be able to have an actual sitting president say , enough of this -- first to himself , and then to the rest of the world .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But there &apos;s something that &apos;s been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago .
And that is , apparently , this is just another move by the gay activists that &apos;s on the gay agenda .
And I &apos;m disturbed by this because I &apos;ve been openly gay now for quite some time .
I &apos;ve been to all of the functions , I &apos;ve been to fundraisers , I &apos;ve written about the topic , and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda .
I &apos;ve paid my dues on time , I &apos;ve marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine , and I &apos;ve yet to see a copy of the gay agenda .
It &apos;s very , very frustrating , and I was feeling left out , like I wasn &apos;t quite gay enough .
But then something wonderful happened : I was out shopping , as I tend to do , and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda .
And I said to myself , &quot; LZ , for so long , you have been denied this .
When you get in front of this crowd , you &apos;re gonna share the news .
You &apos;re gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder , what exactly is in the gay agenda ?
What are these gays up to ?
What do they want ? &quot;
So , without further ado , I will present to you , ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful , &apos; cause it &apos;s evil -- a copy , the official copy , of the gay agenda .
The gay agenda , people !
There it is !
Did you soak it all in ? The gay agenda .
Some of you may be calling it , what , the Constitution of the United States , is that what you call it too ?
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda .
These gays , people like me , want to be treated like full citizens and it &apos;s all written down in plain sight .
I was blown away when I saw it . I was like , wait , this is the gay agenda ?
Why didn &apos;t you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about ?
I wouldn &apos;t have been so confused ; I wouldn &apos;t have been so upset .
But there it is . The gay agenda .
Run for your heterosexual lives .
Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered ?
That &apos;s the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed , because there &apos;s no protection from discrimination of GLBT people .
Did you know in the states where there &apos;s no shading that you can be fired for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered ?
Not based upon the quality of your work , how long you &apos;ve been there , if you stink , just if you &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered .
All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda , also known as the U.S. Constitution .
Specifically , this little amendment right here : &quot; No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . &quot;
I &apos;m looking at you , North Carolina .
But you &apos;re not looking at the U.S. Constitution .
This is the gay agenda : equality . Not special rights , but the rights that were already written by these people -- these elitists , if you will .
Educated , well-dressed , some would dare say questionably dressed .
Nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
The people that , we say , knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution -- the gay agenda , if you will .
All of that flies in the face of what they did .
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda .
Because I figured if I made it funny , you wouldn &apos;t be as threatened .
I figured if I was a bit irreverent , you wouldn &apos;t find it serious .
But when you see the map , and you see our state of Michigan -- it &apos;s legal to fire someone for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , that it &apos;s legal to remove someone from their home because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone &apos;s rights away , it &apos;s about granting them the rights that &#91; have &#93; already been stated .
And we &apos;re just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated , that we &apos;ve already agreed upon .
There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don &apos;t show anyone who they really are right here at home . This isn &apos;t just about North Carolina ; all those states that were clear , it &apos;s legal .
If I could brag for a second , I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage .
He has a 4.0 .
He is starting a new club at school , Policy Debate .
He &apos;s a budding track star ; he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in .
He volunteers .
He prays before he eats .
I would like to think , as his father -- and he lives with me primarily -- that I had a little something to do with all of that .
I would like to think that he &apos;s a good boy , a respectful young man . I would like to think that I &apos;ve proven to be a capable father .
But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today , and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage , I would be disqualified for only one reason : because I &apos;m gay .
It doesn &apos;t matter what I &apos;ve already proven , what I can do with my heart .
It &apos;s because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption .
And that &apos;s not just about me , that &apos;s about so many other Michiganders , U.S. citizens , who don &apos;t understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are .
This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country &apos;s history .
There was a time in which , I don &apos;t know , people who were black couldn &apos;t have the same rights .
People who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
There was a point in our history in which , if you were considered disabled , that an employer could just fire you , before the Americans with Disabilities Act .
We keep doing this over and over again .
And so here we are , 2012 , gay agenda , gay lifestyle , and I &apos;m not a good dad and people don &apos;t deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are , not who they are .
So when you hear the words &quot; gay lifestyle &quot; and &quot; gay agenda &quot; in the future , I encourage you to do two things : One , remember the U.S. Constitution , and then two , if you wouldn &apos;t mind looking to your left , please .
Look to your right .
That person next to you is a brother , is a sister .
And they should be treated with love and respect .
Thank you .
Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October .
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
We &apos;ve gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage , but we still can &apos;t do that with water , and here &apos;s why .
Right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
It &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
And it ignores the fact that , in the meanwhile , people still need to drink water .
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn &apos;t come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they &apos;re safe .
I &apos;ve been inspired by that simplicity as I &apos;ve been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I &apos;ve ever known .
We think there &apos;s a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
It &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
We call it the Water Canary .
It &apos;s a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : Is this water contaminated ?
It doesn &apos;t require any special training .
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place , it uses light .
That means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
To test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .
This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold .
We &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM .
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time .
With enough users , maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action , containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from .
And then , instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most , it can happen automatically .
We &apos;ve seen how distributed networks , big data and information can transform society .
I think it &apos;s time for us to apply them to water .
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
Thank you .
I , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities .
And there are days -- I don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
And some days , that can even be a little scary .
But what I &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
A couple of years ago , I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
Now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment .
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- was it &apos;s precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system .
So , I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space .
And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants &apos; root systems .
Now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
Fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors .
And the way it works is that there &apos;s a pump at the bottom , which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top , which then trickles down through plants &apos; root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there &apos;s no dirt involved .
Now light and temperature vary with each window &apos;s microclimate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically .
Back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing .
And I really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people &apos;s food .
So I decided that , instead of creating a product , what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers .
The first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window .
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff .
But the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved .
So to bring on more co-developers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
So actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
And we have window farms all over the world .
What we &apos;re doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R &amp; amp ; D , or research and development .
But what we call it is R &amp; amp ; D-I-Y , or research and develop it yourself .
So for example , Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half .
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he &apos;s been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients .
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they &apos;re now making open source and part of the project .
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
And with every open source project , the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
And we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
So for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
And there &apos;s a patent pending on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
And to fund the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don &apos;t have time to build their own systems .
Now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
In our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else &apos;s idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs .
But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
So she expresses here what it &apos;s like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
And what we &apos;re seeing is that R &amp; amp ; D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems .
And we &apos;re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
And we &apos;re looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now .
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pioneers .
It &apos;s Monday morning .
In Washington , the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office , assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen .
At Number 10 Downing Street , David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession .
In Madrid , Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door , listening to her baby crying and crying , trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it .
And I am sitting by my father &apos;s bedside in hospital , trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , &quot; You must make him drink today , &quot; -- my father &apos;s been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , I might actually kill him .
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives , and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .
We talk things over with our friends , we scour the Internet , we search through books .
But still , even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends , it &apos;s still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters .
Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity , we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own .
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
But I believe that this is a big problem , a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society , as a culture and as individuals .
It &apos;s not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have .
The problem lies with us : we &apos;ve become addicted to experts .
We &apos;ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
We &apos;ve surrendered our power , trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .
This is no exaggeration .
In a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak .
The results were quite extraordinary .
As they listened to the experts &apos; voices , the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off .
It literally flat-lined .
And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice , however right or wrong .
But experts do get things wrong .
Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10 ?
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself , you &apos;re statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you ?
And then there &apos;s , of course , the example that we &apos;re all too aware of : financial experts getting it so wrong that we &apos;re living through the worst recession since the 1930s .
For the sake of our health , our wealth and our collective security , it &apos;s imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on .
And I &apos;m saying this as an economist who , over the past few years , has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why , but also -- and I &apos;m aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself , as a professor , as somebody who advises prime ministers , heads of big companies , international organizations , but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change , that we need to become more open-minded , more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view .
So in order to help you understand where I &apos;m coming from , let me bring you into my world , the world of experts .
Now there are , of course , exceptions , wonderful , civilization-enhancing exceptions .
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
Alan Greenspan &apos;s proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on , not challenged by his peers , until after the crisis , of course .
You see , we also learn that experts are located , are governed , by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England , say , who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire , or the psychiatrists in the United States who , up until 1973 , were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness .
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we &apos;ve all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they &apos;re about to bring by market .
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study .
And we &apos;ve also got to be aware that experts , of course , also make mistakes .
They make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness .
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
A common thinking error of radiologists , for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they &apos;re overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient &apos;s problem to be .
So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia , say , what happens is that , if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan , they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient &apos;s lungs .
I &apos;ve shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts .
These are , of course , not the only insights I could share , but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them , why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on .
But how can we do this ?
Well for the sake of time , I want to focus on just three strategies .
First , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
This doesn &apos;t mean having to get a Ph.D.
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be relieved to hear .
But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
Why was it that , when I had an operation , &quot; Beware , Ms. Hertz , of hyperpyrexia , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; Watch out for a high fever . &quot;
You see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs , their equations , their forecasts , their prophecies , and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like : What are the assumptions that underpin this ?
What is the evidence upon which this is based ?
What has your investigation focused on ?
And what has it ignored ?
It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
It seems that they &apos;ve somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world &apos;s population are women .
And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don &apos;t work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they &apos;re actively harmful for women to take .
Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts &apos; assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed .
Second , we need to create the space for what I call &quot; managed dissent . &quot;
If we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views .
All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter .
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
And that &apos;s why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .
In meetings , he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed , looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion , trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion , so that they have dissent within the room .
Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement , discord and difference .
But we need to go even further .
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees , fancy titles , diplomas , best-selling books -- high-status individuals .
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO &apos;s , but also shop-girls -- yeah .
Best Buy , the consumer electronics company , gets all its employees -- the cleaners , the shop assistants , the people in the back office , not just its forecasting team -- to place bets , yes bets , on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas , on whether customers &apos; new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company , on whether a project will come in on time .
By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , Best Buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time .
Because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .
It turned out that they were aware , as no one else within the company was , of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts , nor the experts on the ground in China , were even aware of .
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent , taking experts on , democratizing expertise , rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing , complex , difficult times .
For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on , if we challenge experts , if we &apos;re skeptical , if we devolve authority , if we are rebellious , but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance , uncertainty and doubt , and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too , we will set ourselves up much better For now , more than ever , is not the time to be blindly following , blindly accepting , blindly trusting .
Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using experts to help us figure things out , for sure -- I don &apos;t want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and , of course , also our own .
Thank you .
This is a wheat bread , a whole wheat bread , and it &apos;s made with a new technique that I &apos;ve been playing around with , and developing and writing about which , for lack of a better name , we call the epoxy method .
And I call it an epoxy method because -- it &apos;s not very appetizing . I understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy , what &apos;s epoxy ?
It &apos;s two resins that are , sort of , in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue , but when you put the two together , something happens . A bond takes place , and you get this very strong , powerful adhesive .
Well , in this technique , what I &apos;ve tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world , the artisan bread-baking community , has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we &apos;ve been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads .
And let &apos;s face it , everyone &apos;s trying to move towards whole grains .
We finally , after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option , we &apos;re finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them .
The challenge , though , for a wholegrain baker is , you know , how do you make it taste good ?
Because whole grain -- it &apos;s easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread . White flour is sweet .
It &apos;s mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ? It &apos;s -- thank you -- sugar , yes .
So a baker , and a good baker , knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch .
With whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
You &apos;ve got bran , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber , for the bran is fiber .
It &apos;s got germ . Those are the good things , but those aren &apos;t the tastiest parts of the wheat .
So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads , and people don &apos;t like to eat , quote , health food . They like to eat healthy and healthily , but when we think of something as a health food , we think of it as something we eat out of obligation , not out of passion and love for the flavor .
And ultimately , the challenge of the baker , the challenge of every culinary student , of every chef , is to deliver flavor .
Flavor is king . Flavor rules .
I call it the flavor rule . Flavor rules .
And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that &apos;s good for them once , but they won &apos;t eat it again if they don &apos;t like it , right ?
So , this is the challenge for this bread .
We &apos;re going to try this at lunch , and I &apos;ll explain a bit more about it , but it &apos;s made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt , again , at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened .
It &apos;s just dough that is wet .
It &apos;s hydrated dough we call &quot; the soaker &quot; -- that helps to start enzyme activity .
And enzymes are the secret , kind of , ingredient in dough that brings out flavor .
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch .
That &apos;s what enzymes are doing .
And so , if we can release some of those , they become accessible to us in our palate .
They become accessible to the yeast as food .
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust .
The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment .
And it &apos;s made -- it can be a sourdough starter , or what we call a &quot; biga &quot; or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it , and that starts to develop flavor also .
And on day two , we put those two pieces together . That &apos;s the epoxy .
And we &apos;re hoping that , sort of , the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough , and when we put them together and add the final ingredients , we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain .
That &apos;s the challenge . Okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages .
I &apos;m going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start with the first stage .
And this is what every student has to begin with .
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is &quot; mise en place , &quot; which is just a French way of saying , &quot; get organized . &quot;
Everything in its place . First stage .
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients .
Stage two is mixing . We take the ingredients and we mix them .
We have to develop the gluten .
There &apos;s no gluten in flour . There &apos;s only the potential for gluten .
Here &apos;s another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we &apos;ve got glutenin and gliadin , neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread .
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other , they create a stronger molecule , a stronger protein we call gluten .
And so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
Then we get into fermentation , the third stage , which is really where the flavor develops .
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
It &apos;s yeast burps and sweat .
And somehow , this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food , and we &apos;re going to explore that in a minute .
But then , quickly through the next few stages .
We , after it &apos;s fermented and it &apos;s developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
And then we take those units and we shape them . We give them a little pre-shape , usually a round or a little torpedo shape , sometimes .
That &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
And there &apos;s a short rest period . It can be for a few seconds .
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes . We call that resting or benching .
Then we go into final shaping , &quot; panning &quot; -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan .
This takes a second , but it &apos;s a distinctive stage .
It can be in a basket . It can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
And then , stage nine .
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages . Again , developing more flavor .
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine .
We call it &quot; proofing . &quot;
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape , and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 .
Three transformations take place in the oven .
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust .
They give us that beautiful brown crust .
Only the crust can caramelize . It &apos;s the only place that gets hot enough .
Inside , the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates .
When it gets to about 160 degrees , the proteins all line up and they create structure , the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread .
And the starches , when they reach about 180 degrees , gelatinize .
And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation .
Coagulation , caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that &apos;s around them , they -- they kind of swell , and then they burst .
And they burst , and they spill their guts into the bread .
So basically now we &apos;re eating yeast sweats -- sweat , burps and starch guts .
Again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
And stage 11 , we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .
There &apos;s a little carry-over baking .
The proteins have to set up , strengthen and firm up .
And then we have stage 12 , which the textbooks call &quot; packaging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
And so , we &apos;re going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat , and in a few minutes we will try this , and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker &apos;s mission of pulling out flavor .
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps , and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation , because I really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea . This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels : the literal , the metaphoric or poetic level , the political or ethical level .
And ultimately , the mystical or sometimes called the &quot; anagogical &quot; level .
It &apos;s hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal .
In fact , Dante says you can &apos;t understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level , so that &apos;s why we &apos;re talking literally about bread .
But let &apos;s kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question , &quot; What is it about bread that &apos;s so special ? &quot;
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor .
Because what happens is , bread begins as wheat or any other grain .
But what &apos;s wheat ? Wheat is a grass that grows in the field .
And , like all grasses , at a certain point it puts out seeds .
And we harvest those seeds , and those are the wheat kernels .
Now , in order to harvest it -- I mean , what &apos;s harvesting ?
It &apos;s just a euphemism for killing , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s harvest -- we say we harvest the pig , you know ?
Yes , we slaughter , you know . Yes , that &apos;s life .
We harvest the wheat , and in harvesting it , we kill it .
Now , wheat is alive , and as we harvest it , it gives up its seeds .
Now , at least with seeds we have the potential for future life .
We can plant those in the ground .
And we save some of those for the next generation .
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
And at that point , the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity .
It &apos;s not only been killed , but it &apos;s been denied any potential for creating future life .
So we turn it into flour .
So as I said , I think bread is a transformational food .
The first transformation -- and , by the way , the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else .
O.K. ? Radical , not subtle .
Not like hot water made cold , or cold water turned hot , but water boiled off and becoming steam .
That &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
Well , in this case , the first transformation is alive to dead .
I &apos;d call that radical .
So , we &apos;ve got now this flour .
And what do we do ? We add some water .
In stage one , we weigh it .
In stage two , we add water and salt to it , mix it together , and we create something that we call &quot; clay . &quot;
It &apos;s like clay .
And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call &quot; leaven . &quot;
In this case , it &apos;s yeast , but yeast is leaven . What does leaven mean ?
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify , to bring to life .
By the way , what &apos;s the Hebrew word for clay ? Adam .
You see , the baker , in this moment , has become , in a sense , sort of , the God of his dough , you know , and his dough , well , while it &apos;s not an intelligent life form , is now alive .
And we know it &apos;s alive because in stage three , it grows . Growth is the proof of life .
And while it &apos;s growing , all these literal transformations are taking place .
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol .
Bacteria is in there , eating the same sugars , turning them into acids .
In other words , personality and character &apos;s being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker .
And the baker &apos;s choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product .
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it &apos;s all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . That &apos;s the art of baking .
So all these things are determined by the baker , and the bread goes through some stages , and characters develop .
And then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
And as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re raised again , all along proving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
And at stage 10 , we take it to the oven .
It &apos;s still dough . Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do , I think , but not too many .
I &apos;ve met some dough eaters , but -- it &apos;s not the staff of life , right ? Bread is the staff of life .
But dough is what we &apos;re working with , and we take that dough to the oven , and it goes into the oven . As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees , it passes what we call the &quot; thermal death point . &quot;
Students love that TDP . They think it &apos;s the name of a video game .
But it &apos;s the thermal death point -- all life ceases there .
The yeast , whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough , to enliven it , to vivify it , in order to complete its mission , which is also to turn this dough into bread , has to give up its life .
So you see the symbolism at work ? It &apos;s starting to come forth a little bit , you know .
It &apos;s starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
Third transformation . First transformation , alive to dead .
Second transformation , dead brought back to life .
Third transformation , alive to dead -- but dough to bread .
Or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
And it &apos;s what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life .
This is the product that everyone in the world eats , that is so difficult to give up .
It &apos;s so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
It &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
And so , as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that , again completing the life cycle , you know , we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us , and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this .
So this is what I &apos;ve learned from bread .
This is what bread has taught me in my journey .
And what we &apos;re going to attempt to do with this bread here , again , is to use , in addition to everything we talked about , this bread we &apos;re going to call &quot; spent grain bread &quot; because , as you know , bread-making is very similar to beer-making .
Beer is basically liquid bread , or bread is solid beer .
And -- they -- they &apos;re invented around the same time . I think beer came first .
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot , Egyptian sun , and it turned into bread .
But we &apos;ve got this bread , and what I did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we &apos;ve added into it the spent grain from beer-making .
And if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer .
I like dark spent grain . Today we &apos;re using a light spent grain that &apos;s actually from , like , some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that &apos;s been toasted .
In other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
We &apos;re going to take some of that , and put it into the bread .
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread , but now fiber on top of fiber .
And so this is , again , hopefully not only a healthy bread , but a bread that you will enjoy .
So , if I , kind of , break this bread , maybe we can share this now a little bit here .
We &apos;ll start a little piece here , and I &apos;m going to take a little piece here -- I think I &apos;d better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .
I &apos;ll leave you with what I call the baker &apos;s blessing .
May your crust be crisp , and your bread always rise .
Thank you .
So I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase .
So we see it in religions and self-help books , that money can &apos;t buy happiness .
And I want to suggest today that , in fact , that &apos;s wrong .
I &apos;m at a business school , so that &apos;s what we do .
So that &apos;s wrong , and , in fact , if you think that , you &apos;re actually just not spending it right .
So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it , maybe if you spent it differently , that might work a little bit better .
And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier , let &apos;s think about the ways we usually spend it that don &apos;t , in fact , make us happier .
We had a little natural experiment .
So CNN , a little while ago , wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery .
It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing .
This article &apos;s about how their lives get ruined .
So what happens when people win the lottery is , number one , they spend all the money and go into debt , and number two , all of their friends and everyone they &apos;ve ever met find them and bug them for money .
And it ruins their social relationships , in fact .
So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery .
What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article , readers of the thing .
And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn &apos;t lead to happiness , everyone instantly started saying , &quot; You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ? &quot;
and fantasizing about what they &apos;d do .
And here &apos;s just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about .
One person wrote in , &quot; When I win , I &apos;m going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . &quot;
And another person wrote , &quot; I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . &quot;
This is even worse now : &quot; Then I &apos;d have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made .
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . &quot;
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type , where people got money and , in fact , it made them antisocial .
So I told you that it ruins people &apos;s lives and that their friends bug them .
It also , money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves .
Well maybe the reason that money doesn &apos;t make us happy is that we &apos;re always spending it on the wrong things , and in particular , that we &apos;re always spending it on ourselves .
And we thought , I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people .
So instead of being antisocial with your money , what if you were a little more prosocial with your money ?
And we thought , let &apos;s make people do it and see what happens .
So let &apos;s have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let &apos;s make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happier .
So the first way that we did this .
On one Vancouver morning , we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said , &quot; Do you want to be in an experiment ? &quot;
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
We asked them how happy they were , and then we gave them an envelope .
And one of the envelopes had things in it that said , &quot; By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on yourself . &quot;
So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on .
Other people , in the morning , got a slip of paper that said , &quot; By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on somebody else . &quot;
Also inside the envelope was money .
And we manipulated how much money we gave them .
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
We let them go about their day . They did whatever they wanted to do .
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to .
We called them up at night and asked them , &quot; What &apos;d you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? &quot;
What did they spend it on ?
Well these are college undergrads , so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup .
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece .
People gave money to homeless people .
Huge effect here of Starbucks .
So if you give undergraduates five dollars , it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can .
But some people bought a coffee for themselves , the way they usually would , but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else .
So the very same purchase , just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else .
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day ?
People who spent money on other people got happier .
People who spent money on themselves , nothing happened .
It didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn &apos;t matter that much .
So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars .
In fact , it doesn &apos;t matter how much money you spent .
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself .
We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves .
Of course , these are undergraduates in Canada -- not the world &apos;s most representative population .
They &apos;re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries .
So we went , in fact , to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
So imagine , instead of just people in Canada , we said , &quot; Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people .
Describe it . How happy did it make you ? &quot;
Or in Uganda , &quot; Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that . &quot;
And then we asked them how happy they are again .
And what we see is sort of amazing because there &apos;s human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well .
So for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
He said , &quot; I called a girl I wished to love . &quot;
They basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn &apos;t &quot; achieve &quot; her up till now .
Here &apos;s a guy from Canada .
Very similar thing .
&quot; I took my girlfriend out for dinner .
We went to a movie , we left early , and then went back to her room for ... &quot; only cake -- just a piece of cake .
Human universal -- so you spend money on other people , you &apos;re being nice to them .
Maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
But then we see extraordinary differences .
So look at these two .
This is a woman from Canada .
We say , &quot; Name a time you spent money on somebody else . &quot;
She says , &quot; I bought a present for my mom .
I drove to the mall in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom . &quot;
Perfectly nice thing to do .
It &apos;s good to get gifts for people that you know .
Compare that to this woman from Uganda .
&quot; I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria .
They had no money , they went to a clinic and I gave her this money . &quot;
This isn &apos;t $ 10,000 , it &apos;s the local currency .
So it &apos;s a very small amount of money , in fact .
But enormously different motivations here .
This is a real medical need , literally a life-saving donation .
Above , it &apos;s just kind of , I bought a gift for my mother .
What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn &apos;t nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy , which is really quite important .
So you don &apos;t have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy .
You can do small , trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this .
These are only two countries .
We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness .
We got data from the Gallup Organization , which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately .
They ask people , &quot; Did you donate money to charity recently ? &quot;
and they ask them , &quot; How happy are you with your life in general ? &quot;
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things .
Are they positively correlated ? Giving money makes you happy .
Or are they negatively correlated ?
On this map , green will mean they &apos;re positively correlated and red means they &apos;re negatively correlated .
And you can see , the world is crazily green .
So in almost every country in the world where we have this data , people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don &apos;t give money to charity .
I know you &apos;re all looking at that red country in the middle .
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &apos;s Central African Republic .
You can make up stories . Maybe it &apos;s different there for some reason or another .
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though , which is amazingly green .
So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself .
What about your work life , which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we &apos;re not with the people we know .
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing .
So these are sales teams in Belgium .
They work in teams ; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs .
So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
Some teams , we give people on the team some money for themselves and say , &quot; Spend it however you want on yourself , &quot; just like we did with the undergrads in Canada .
But other teams we say , &quot; Here &apos;s 15 euro .
Spend it on one of your teammates this week .
Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them .
And then we can see , well now we &apos;ve got teams that spend on themselves and we &apos;ve got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better .
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that .
A very silly , trivial thing to do , but think of the difference on a team that didn &apos;t do that at all , that got 15 euro , put it in their pocket , maybe bought themselves a coffee , or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity .
What we see is that , in fact , the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves .
And one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves , they put it in their pocket , they don &apos;t do anything different than they did before .
You don &apos;t get any money from that .
You actually lose money because it doesn &apos;t motivate them to perform any better .
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates , they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money .
And I realize that you &apos;re probably thinking to yourselves , this is all fine , but there &apos;s a context that &apos;s incredibly important for public policy and I can &apos;t imagine it would work there .
And basically that if he doesn &apos;t show me that it works here , I don &apos;t believe anything he said .
And I know what you &apos;re all thinking about are dodgeball teams .
This was a huge criticism that we got to say , if you can &apos;t show it with dodgeball teams , this is all stupid .
So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them .
And we did the exact same thing as before .
So some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
Other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before .
The teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they dominate the league by the time they &apos;re done .
Across all of these different contexts -- your personal life , you work life , even silly things like intramural sports -- we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself .
And so I &apos;ll just say , I think if you think money can &apos;t buy happiness you &apos;re not spending it right .
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that &apos;s the way to make yourself happier .
It &apos;s in fact , that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead .
And we luckily have an opportunity for you .
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools .
They post projects , so they say , &quot; I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don &apos;t have the books , &quot; or &quot; I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don &apos;t have a microscope . &quot;
You and I can go on and buy it for them .
The teacher writes you a thank you note . The kids write you a thank you note .
Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking , again , less about &quot; How can I spend money on myself ? &quot;
and more about &quot; If I &apos;ve got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can I do to benefit other people ? &quot;
Because ultimately when you do that , you &apos;ll find that you &apos;ll benefit yourself much more .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend .
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails .
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades .
Now , as many of you may remember , the Red Brigades was a terrorist , Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s .
As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody , not even with their lawyers .
They sat in silence through their trails , waving occasionally at family and friends .
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk , and tell their story .
And I was one of those people .
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me , he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name .
In particular , one person had put it forward .
She was my childhood friend .
She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization .
Naturally , I didn &apos;t know that until the day she was arrested .
In fact , I read it in the newspaper .
At the time of the phone call I just had a baby , I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with , and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons .
But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist , and why she &apos;d never tried to recruit me .
So , this is exactly what I did .
Now , I found the answer very quickly .
I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist .
The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist .
My friend , on the other hand , she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders .
She also embraced violence .
Because she believed that the only way to unblock what , at the time , was known as a blocked democracy , Italy , a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle .
At the same time , while I was interviewing the Red Brigades , I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
They were constantly short of cash .
They were constantly searching for cash .
Now , contrary to what many people believe , terrorism is actually a very expensive business .
I &apos;ll give you an idea .
In the 1970s , the turnover of the Red Brigades was seven million dollars .
This is roughly between 100 and 150 million , today .
Now , you know , if you live underground it &apos;s really hard to produce this amount of money .
But this also explains why , when I was interviewing the Red Brigades , and then , later on , other arms organizations , including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East , everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology , or politics .
Because they had no idea .
The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
All the others do , day in and day out , is search for money .
Once , for example , I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades .
It was a psychiatrist . He loved sailing .
He was a really keen sailor . And he had this beautiful boat .
And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing , every summer , back and forth from Lebanon , where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO , and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms .
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee , which went to fund their organization .
So , because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms , all of the sudden I thought , maybe there is something here .
Maybe there is a link , a commercial link , between one organization and another one .
But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti , the head of the Red Brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro , Italian former prime minister , that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy .
And as we were eating , I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist .
This guy thought in the same way I did .
So , I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism .
Naturally , nobody wanted to fund my research .
In fact , I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy .
You know , that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money , thinking about the economics of terrorism .
So , in the end , I took a decision that , in retrospect , did change my life .
I sold my company , and funded the research myself .
And what I discovered is this parallel reality , another international economic system , which runs parallel to our own , which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II .
And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed , step by step , the evolution of our own system , of our Western capitalism .
And there are three main stages .
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
The second one is the privatization of terrorism .
And the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
So , state sponsor of terrorism , feature of the Cold War .
This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy , along the periphery of the sphere of influence , fully funding arms organizations .
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
So , the link between crime and terror is established very early on .
And here is the best example , the Contras in Nicaragua , created by the CIA , legally funded by the U.S. Congress , illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation , for example , the Iran-Contra Affair .
Then comes the late 1970s , early &apos; 80s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
So , they gain independence from the sponsor , and start funding themselves .
Now , again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities .
So , Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek√°a Valley , which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria .
And the IRA , which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland , did exactly the same thing .
So , every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing , actually , was funding the IRA .
But the great change came , of course , with globalization and deregulation .
This is when arms organization were able to link up , also financially , with each other .
But above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel .
This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda .
This is an organization that can raise money across border .
But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
Now , deregulation also brought back rogue economics .
So what is rogue economics ?
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .
It comes back at times of great transformation , globalization being one of those transformations .
It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy , and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us .
It has happened before in history .
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire .
It has happened with Industrial Revolution .
And it actually happened again , with the fall of the Berlin wall .
Now , I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9-11 .
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars .
It is trillions , it &apos;s not billions .
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom , soon will be more , considering where this country is going .
Now , until 9-11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States .
The entry point , of course , of most of this money were the off-shore facilities .
So , this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy .
Now , when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply , the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy which , of course , reflects the growth of the economy .
So , when I went to look at those figures , I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States , never to come back .
These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers , in cash of course .
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers .
These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
So , you see , what is the relationship ?
The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world .
What does it mean ? That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world .
This privilege is called seigniorage .
No other country can do that .
All the other countries , for example the United Kingdom , can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders .
So , here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime , terror , and illegal economy , and our economy .
The U.S. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
This is how close we are with this world .
Now , this situation changed , of course , after 9-11 , because George Bush launched the War on Terror .
Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act .
Now , many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance .
And it is , in fact , an anti-money-laundering legislation .
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank , and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .
It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars , and the U.S. economy .
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .
Now , you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking .
All the bankers said to their clients , &quot; Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else . &quot;
Now , the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
And this is what people did .
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their clientele .
The same thing happened , of course , in the world of crime and terror .
People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe .
Why did this happen ? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation .
It was introduced only in the United States .
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars .
In Europe , a similar legislation was not introduced .
So , within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
So , this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror , and our own life .
So , why did I tell you this story ?
I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
You got to question everything that is told to you , including what I just told you today .
This is the only way for you to step into the dark side , and have a look at it .
And believe me , it &apos;s going to be scary .
It &apos;s going to be frightful , but it &apos;s going to enlighten you .
And , above all , it &apos;s not going to be boring .
The old story about climate protection is that it &apos;s costly , or it would have been done already .
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it .
The new story about climate protection is that it &apos;s not costly , but profitable .
This was a simple sign error , because it &apos;s cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel , as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example , Dupont , SD micro electronics .
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants , and they get their money back in two or three years .
That &apos;s called a profit .
Now , similarly , the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it , it would be expensive , or we would have done it already , because markets are essentially perfect .
If , of course , that were true , there would be no innovation , and nobody could make any money .
But the new story about oil is the government doesn &apos;t have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally , but completely -- quite the contrary . The United States , for example , can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it &apos;s so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it .
This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
This thesis is set out in a book called &quot; Winning the Oil Endgame &quot; that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com -- about 170,000 downloads so far .
And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon -- it &apos;s independent , it &apos;s peer-reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal .
Now , a bit of economic history , I think , may be helpful here .
Around 1850 , one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling .
And whale oil lit practically every building .
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil , in 1859 , at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared , thanks to fatal competitors , chiefly oil and gas made from coal , to which the whalers had not been paying attention .
So , very unexpectedly , they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales .
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists .
And it &apos;s funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil .
We &apos;ve been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil , and no one had bothered to add them up before .
So when we did , we found some very surprising things .
Now , there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil .
Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk .
On the competitiveness front , we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together .
And serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car ?
Maybe a decade , according to my friends in Detroit .
China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology .
They &apos;re not going to export your uncle &apos;s Buick .
And after that comes India .
The point here is , these cars are going to be made super efficient .
The question is , who will make them ?
Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil , or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars ?
That seems to make more sense .
The more we keep on using the oil , particularly the imported oil , the more we face a very obvious array of problems .
Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing , but nothing is not the right number .
It could well be enough to double the oil price , for example .
And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil , if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don &apos;t have oil .
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens .
They don &apos;t like fighting over oil , they don &apos;t like being in the sands and they don &apos;t like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates .
Now , in order to avoid these problems , whatever you think they &apos;re worth , it &apos;s actually not that complicated .
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently , at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel .
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas .
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
And compared with the official forecast , that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025 , which is half of what we &apos;ve been paying lately , that will save 70 billion dollars a year , starting quite soon .
Now , in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars : half of it to retool the car , truck and plane industries ; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry .
In the process , we will gain about a million good jobs , mainly rural .
And protect another million jobs now at risk , mainly in auto-making .
And we &apos;ll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
So that &apos;s a very handsome return .
It &apos;s financeable in the private capital market .
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned , to happen sooner and with higher confidence , then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic .
And these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
They make a little net money for the treasury .
They have a broad trans-ideological appeal , and because we want them actually to happen , we figured out ways to do them that do not require much , if any , federal legislation , and can , indeed , be done administratively or at a state level .
Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem , namely , light vehicles , here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag , and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive .
You can sort of have it all with these things .
For example , this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon .
This muscle car from Toyota : 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gallon . I &apos;ll say more later about this .
And in the upper left , a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid , in a four-seater .
Well , saving that fuel , 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon .
But it &apos;s even a better deal for heavy trucks , where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon , with better aerodynamics and tires and engines , and so on , and taking out weight so you can put it into payload .
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return .
Then you can go even further , almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements , double the big haulers &apos; margins .
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull , and flip the market .
In the airplane business , it &apos;s again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free , as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner .
But then the next generation of planes saves about half .
Again , much cheaper than buying the fuel .
And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body , kind of a flying wing with internal engines , then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost .
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan , of all the fuel energy you feed into the car , seven-eighths never gets to the wheels ; it &apos;s lost first in the engine , idling at zero miles a gallon , the power train and accessories .
So then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car pushes aside .
And only this little bit , only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop .
In fact , since 95 percent of the weight you &apos;re moving is the car not the driver , less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver .
This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort .
Moreover , three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car .
And it &apos;s obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels .
So there &apos;s huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter .
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well , then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car , and it would cost a lot more to make , because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium .
But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials .
For example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .
Here &apos;s a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf .
The Golf was totaled .
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel .
They &apos;ll pop it back on and fix the scratch later .
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel , and do so a lot more smoothly .
And this means we &apos;ve just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight .
We could make cars bigger , which is protective , but make them light .
Whereas if we made them heavy , they &apos;d be both hostile and inefficient .
And when you make them light in the right way , that can be simpler and cheaper to make .
You can end up saving money , and lives , and oil , all at the same time .
I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic , uncompromised , quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle -- -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable .
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely .
We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff , strong , carbon-composite material , and then ways to thermoform it , because it &apos;s a combination of carbon and nylon , into whatever complex shapes you want , like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers .
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified .
Because the auto body has only , say , 14 parts , instead of 100 , 150 .
Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel .
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist .
They snap together like a kid &apos;s toy .
So you got rid of the body shop .
And if you want , you can lay color in the mold , and get rid of the paint shop .
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car .
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry , which GM has in Lansing .
The plant also gets smaller .
Now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feedstocks and so on , you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
And then another six can be made robustly , competitively , from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel , without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production .
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved , about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price .
And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it , with lots left over .
So much , in fact , that after you &apos;ve handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved , you have only this little bit left , and let &apos;s see how we can meet that , because there &apos;s a pretty flexible menu of ways .
We could , of course , buy more efficiency .
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12 .
Or wait to capture the second half of it .
Or we could , of course , just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil , or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us .
But they &apos;ll sell it to Japan and China instead , because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers , and they don &apos;t .
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance , or if we used it as hydrogen , which is more profitable and efficient , we &apos;d get rid of the domestic oil too .
And that doesn &apos;t even count , for example , that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country .
So we have lots of options .
And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible .
Now , to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence , there is a few ways government could help .
For example , fee-bates , a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles .
You &apos;re not paid to change size class .
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class , in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three .
This expands choice rapidly in the market , and actually makes more money for automakers as well .
I &apos;d like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient , reliable , warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get .
And for each car so financed , scrap almost one clunker , preferably the dirtiest ones .
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren &apos;t going to get otherwise , because they weren &apos;t creditworthy and could never afford a new car .
And Detroit will make money on every unit .
It turns out that if , say , African-American and white households had the same car ownership , it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .
So this is a huge social win , too .
Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year .
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster .
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot that &apos;s worth stretching further for .
For example , a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles , like some you saw earlier .
Then the legacy airlines can &apos;t afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills , but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that , there are ways to finance it .
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes , so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air , they would waste more oil , and block the uptake of efficient , new planes .
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive .
We ought to take them out back and shoot them , and put bounty hunters after them .
Then there &apos;s an important military role .
That in creating the move to high-volume , low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials , or for that matter , ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology , the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet .
Just turn it over to the private sector , and we have an Internet .
The same for GPS .
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry .
That is , military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil , which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security .
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining , and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates , and get out of our own way in other ways .
And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
But here &apos;s how the whole thing fits together .
Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up , they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency , down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks , all implemented at slower rates than we &apos;ve done before when we paid attention .
And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there , we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s .
And the one thing I &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
In this eight-year period , 1977 to 85 , when we last paid attention , the economy grew 27 percent , oil use fell 17 percent , oil imports fell 50 percent , oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent .
They would have been gone if we &apos;d kept that up one more year .
Well , that was with very old technologies and delivery methods .
We could rerun that play a lot better now .
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC .
Ours is on the demand side .
We are the Saudi Arabia of &quot; nega-barrels . &quot;
We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil .
Whatever your reason for wanting to do this , whether you &apos;re concerned about national security or price volatility -- -- or jobs , or the planet , or your grand-kids , it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win .
Please download your copy , and thank you very much .
Good morning . How are you ? It &apos;s been great , hasn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
In fact , I &apos;m leaving .
There have been three themes , haven &apos;t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what I want to talk about .
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here . Just the variety of it and the range of it . The second is that it &apos;s put us in a place where we have no idea what &apos;s going to happen , in terms of the future . No idea how this may play out .
I have an interest in education -- actually , what I find is everybody has an interest in education .
Don &apos;t you ? I find this very interesting .
If you &apos;re at a dinner party , and you say you work in education -- actually , you &apos;re not often at dinner parties , frankly , if you work in education .
You &apos;re not asked .
And you &apos;re never asked back , curiously . That &apos;s strange to me .
But if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
and you say you work in education , you can see the blood run from their face . They &apos;re like , &quot; Oh my God , &quot; you know , &quot; Why me ? My one night out all week . &quot;
But if you ask about their education , they pin you to the wall . Because it &apos;s one of those things that goes deep with people , am I right ?
Like religion , and money and other things .
I have a big interest in education , and I think we all do .
We have a huge vested interest in it , partly because it &apos;s education that &apos;s meant to take us into this future that we can &apos;t grasp .
If you think of it , children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 . Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that &apos;s been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years &apos; time . And yet we &apos;re meant to be educating them for it . So the unpredictability , I think , is extraordinary .
And the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . I mean , Sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ? Just seeing what she could do .
And she &apos;s exceptional , but I think she &apos;s not , so to speak , exceptional in the whole of childhood .
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent . And my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents .
And we squander them , pretty ruthlessly .
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity . My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
Thank you very much . So , 15 minutes left .
Well , I was born ... no .
I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson . She was six and she was at the back , drawing , and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention , and in this drawing lesson she did .
The teacher was fascinated and she went over to her and she said , &quot; What are you drawing ? &quot;
And the girl said , &quot; I &apos;m drawing a picture of God . &quot;
And the teacher said , &quot; But nobody knows what God looks like . &quot;
And the girl said , &quot; They will in a minute . &quot;
When my son was four in England -- actually he was four everywhere , to be honest .
If we &apos;re being strict about it , wherever he went , he was four that year .
He was in the Nativity play .
Do you remember the story ? No , it was big .
It was a big story . Mel Gibson did the sequel .
You may have seen it : &quot; Nativity II . &quot; But James got the part of Joseph , which we were thrilled about .
We considered this to be one of the lead parts .
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts : &quot; James Robinson IS Joseph ! &quot;
He didn &apos;t have to speak , but you know the bit where the three kings come in . They come in bearing gifts , and they bring gold , frankincense and myrrh .
This really happened . We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence , because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said , &quot; You OK with that ? &quot; And he said , &quot; Yeah , why ? Was that wrong ? &quot;
They just switched , that was it .
Anyway , the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , &quot; I bring you gold . &quot;
And the second boy said , &quot; I bring you myrrh . &quot;
And the third boy said , &quot; Frank sent this . &quot;
What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance .
If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go .
Am I right ? They &apos;re not frightened of being wrong .
Now , I don &apos;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative .
What we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . And by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And we run our companies like this , by the way .
We stigmatize mistakes . And we &apos;re now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make .
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities . Picasso once said this -- he said that all children are born artists .
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . I believe this passionately , that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , we grow out of it . Or rather , we get educated out if it .
So why is this ?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago .
In fact , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles .
So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was .
Actually , we lived in a place called Snitterfield , just outside Stratford , which is where Shakespeare &apos;s father was born . Are you struck by a new thought ? I was .
You don &apos;t think of Shakespeare having a father , do you ?
Do you ? Because you don &apos;t think of Shakespeare being a child , do you ?
Shakespeare being seven ? I never thought of it . I mean , he was seven at some point . He was in somebody &apos;s English class , wasn &apos;t he ? How annoying would that be ?
&quot; Must try harder . &quot; Being sent to bed by his dad , you know , to Shakespeare , &quot; Go to bed , now , &quot; to William Shakespeare , &quot; and put the pencil down .
And stop speaking like that . It &apos;s confusing everybody . &quot;
Anyway , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles , and I just want to say a word about the transition , actually .
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
I &apos;ve got two kids . He &apos;s 21 now ; my daughter &apos;s 16 .
He didn &apos;t want to come to Los Angeles . He loved it , but he had a girlfriend in England . This was the love of his life , Sarah .
He &apos;d known her for a month .
Mind you , they &apos;d had their fourth anniversary , because it &apos;s a long time when you &apos;re 16 .
Anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , &quot; I &apos;ll never find another girl like Sarah . &quot;
And we were rather pleased about that , frankly , because she was the main reason we were leaving the country .
But something strikes you when you move to America and when you travel around the world : Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects .
Every one . Doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
You &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t .
At the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and the bottom are the arts .
Everywhere on Earth .
And in pretty much every system too , there &apos;s a hierarchy within the arts .
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance . There isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics . Why ?
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
I think math is very important , but so is dance .
Children dance all the time if they &apos;re allowed to , we all do .
We all have bodies , don &apos;t we ? Did I miss a meeting ?
Truthfully , what happens is , as children grow up , we start to educate them progressively from the waist up . And then we focus on their heads .
And slightly to one side .
If you were to visit education , as an alien , and say &quot; What &apos;s it for , public education ? &quot;
I think you &apos;d have to conclude -- if you look at the output , who really succeeds by this , who does everything that they should , who gets all the brownie points , who are the winners -- I think you &apos;d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors . Isn &apos;t it ?
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
And I used to be one , so there .
And I like university professors , but you know , we shouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .
They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life . But they &apos;re rather curious , and I say this out of affection for them .
There &apos;s something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them , but typically -- they live in their heads .
They live up there , and slightly to one side .
They &apos;re disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way .
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads , don &apos;t they ?
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to meetings .
If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences , by the way , get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics , and pop into the discotheque on the final night .
And there you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably , off the beat , waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it .
Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability .
And there &apos;s a reason .
The whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
Number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top . So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . Is that right ?
Don &apos;t do music , you &apos;re not going to be a musician ; don &apos;t do art , you won &apos;t be an artist .
Benign advice -- now , profoundly mistaken . The whole world is engulfed in a revolution .
And the second is academic ability , which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence , because the universities designed the system in their image .
If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance .
And the consequence is that many highly talented , brilliant , creative people think they &apos;re not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn &apos;t valued , or was actually stigmatized .
And I think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
In the next 30 years , according to UNESCO , more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history .
More people , and it &apos;s the combination of all the things we &apos;ve talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work , and demography and the huge explosion in population .
Suddenly , degrees aren &apos;t worth anything . Isn &apos;t that true ?
When I was a student , if you had a degree , you had a job .
If you didn &apos;t have a job it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one .
And I didn &apos;t want one , frankly .
But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games , because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA , and now you need a PhD for the other .
It &apos;s a process of academic inflation .
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet . We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence .
We know three things about intelligence .
One , it &apos;s diverse . We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it . We think visually , we think in sound , we think kinesthetically .
We think in abstract terms , we think in movement .
Secondly , intelligence is dynamic .
If you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive .
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
In fact , creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things .
The brain is intentionally -- by the way , there &apos;s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum . It &apos;s thicker in women .
Following off from Helen yesterday , I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
There &apos;s a raft of research , but I know it from my personal life .
If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often , thankfully .
But you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , she &apos;s good at some things -- but if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s dealing with people on the phone , she &apos;s talking to the kids , she &apos;s painting the ceiling , she &apos;s doing open-heart surgery over here .
If I &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed .
I say , &quot; Terry , please , I &apos;m trying to fry an egg in here . Give me a break . &quot;
Actually , you know that old philosophical thing , if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it , did it happen ? Remember that old chestnut ?
I saw a great t-shirt really recently which said , &quot; If a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? &quot;
And the third thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s distinct . I &apos;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot; Epiphany , &quot; which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent . I &apos;m fascinated by how people got to be there .
It &apos;s really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of ; she &apos;s called Gillian Lynne -- have you heard of her ? Some have . She &apos;s a choreographer and everybody knows her work .
She did &quot; Cats &quot; and &quot; Phantom of the Opera . &quot;
She &apos;s wonderful . I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet in England , as you can see .
Anyway , Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said , &quot; Gillian , how &apos;d you get to be a dancer ? &quot; And she said it was interesting ; when she was at school , she was really hopeless . And the school , in the &apos; 30s , wrote to her parents and said , &quot; We think Gillian has a learning disorder . &quot; She couldn &apos;t concentrate ; she was fidgeting . I think now they &apos;d say she had ADHD . Wouldn &apos;t you ? But this was the 1930s , and ADHD hadn &apos;t been invented at this point .
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
People weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
Anyway , she went to see this specialist . So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school . And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said , &quot; Gillian , I &apos;ve listened to all these things that your mother &apos;s told me , and I need to speak to her privately . &quot;
He said , &quot; Wait here . We &apos;ll be back ; we won &apos;t be very long , &quot; and they went and left her .
But as they went out the room , he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk . And when they got out the room , he said to her mother , &quot; Just stand and watch her . &quot; And the minute they left the room , she said , she was on her feet , moving to the music .
And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said , &quot; Mrs. Lynne , Gillian isn &apos;t sick ; she &apos;s a dancer .
Take her to a dance school . &quot;
I said , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
She said , &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was .
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me . People who couldn &apos;t sit still .
People who had to move to think . &quot; Who had to move to think .
They did ballet ; they did tap ; they did jazz ; they did modern ; they did contemporary .
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School ; she became a soloist ; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet . She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber . She &apos;s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history ; she &apos;s given pleasure to millions ; and she &apos;s a multi-millionaire . Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down .
Now , I think ... What I think it comes to is this : Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson .
I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology , one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity .
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth : for a particular commodity .
And for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we &apos;re educating our children . There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk , who said , &quot; If all the insects were to disappear from the earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end .
If all human beings disappeared from the earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish . &quot;
And he &apos;s right .
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we &apos;ve talked about . And the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are . And our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future .
By the way -- we may not see this future , but they will . And our job is to help them make something of it . Thank you very much .
Hello .
I &apos;m a toy developer .
With a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before , I began working at a toy company nine years ago .
When I first started working there , I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day .
However , my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell , and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data .
Data , data , data .
So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product .
However , I was unable to think of anything new at that moment .
My ideas were unoriginal .
I wasn &apos;t getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking .
It was so hard that I became this skinny .
It &apos;s true . You &apos;ve all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too .
Your boss was being difficult . The data was difficult .
You become sick of thinking .
Now , I throw out the data .
It &apos;s my dream to create new toys .
And now , instead of data , I &apos;m using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas .
I would like to introduce this method today .
What is Shiritori ?
Take apple , elephant and trumpet , for example .
It &apos;s a game where you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word .
It &apos;s the same in Japanese and English .
You can play Shiritori as you like : &quot; neko , kora , raibu , burashi , &quot; etc , etc . &#91; Cat , cola , concert , brush &#93; Many random words will come out .
You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas .
In my case , for example , since I want to think of toys , what could a toy cat be ?
A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place ?
How about a toy with cola ?
A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet ?
Ridiculous ideas are okay . The key is to keep them flowing .
The more ideas you produce , you &apos;re sure to come up with some good ones , too .
A brush , for example . Can we make a toothbrush into a toy ?
We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and -- -- you &apos;ve got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth .
Kids who don &apos;t like to brush their teeth might begin to like it .
Can we make a hat into a toy ?
How about something like a roulette game , where you try the hat on one by one , and then , when someone puts it on , a scary alien breaks through the top screaming , &quot; Ahh ! &quot;
I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties ?
Ideas that didn &apos;t come out while you stare at the data will start to come out .
Actually , this bubble wrap , which is used to pack fragile objects , combined with a toy , made Mugen Pop Pop , a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like .
It was a big hit when it reached stores .
Data had nothing to do with its success .
Although it &apos;s only popping bubbles , it &apos;s a great way to kill time , so please pass this around amongst yourselves today and play with it .
Anyway , you continue to come up with useless ideas .
Think up many trivial ideas , everyone .
If you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you &apos;re aiming for , you &apos;ll end up trying too hard , and you can &apos;t produce new ideas .
Even if you know what your aim is , think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed .
If you do this , you surely will hit somewhere near the center .
At least one will .
That &apos;s the one you should choose .
If you do so , that idea will be in demand and , moreover , it will be brand new .
That is how I think of new ideas .
It doesn &apos;t have to be Shiritori ; there are many different methods .
You just have to choose words at random .
You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random .
For example , you could look up two random letters and gather the results or go to the store and connect product names with what you want to think of .
The point is to gather random words , not information from the category you &apos;re thinking for .
If you do this , the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas .
The greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images .
Because you &apos;re thinking of one word after another , the image of the previous word is still with you .
That image will automatically be related with future words .
Unconsciously , a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat .
You wouldn &apos;t even realize it .
You can come up with ideas that you wouldn &apos;t have thought of otherwise .
This method is , of course , not just for toys .
You can collect ideas for books , apps , events , and many other projects .
I hope you all try this method .
There are futures that are born from data .
However , using this silly game called Shiritori , I look forward to the exciting future you will create , a future you couldn &apos;t even imagine .
Thank you very much .
On June 12 , 2014 , precisely at 3 : 33 in a balmy winter afternoon in S√£o Paulo , Brazil , a typical South American winter afternoon , this kid , this young man that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal , Juliano Pinto , 29 years old , accomplished a magnificent deed .
Despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair , Juliano rose to the occasion , and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed impossible .
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the 2014 Brazilian World Soccer Cup here just by thinking .
He could not move his body , but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball .
He was an athlete before the lesion . He &apos;s a para-athlete right now .
He &apos;s going to be in the Paralympic Games , I hope , in a couple years .
But what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from Juliano was his ability to dream .
And dream he did that afternoon , for a stadium of about 75,000 people and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV .
And that kick crowned , basically , 30 years of basic research studying how the brain , how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about 100 billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms , what Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories and about 15 years to plan .
When John Chapin and I , 15 years ago , proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface , meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices , no matter how far they are from their own bodies , just by imagining what they want to do , our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help , of the psychiatry variety .
And despite that , a Scot and a Brazilian persevered , because that &apos;s how we were raised in our respective countries , and for 12 , 15 years , we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible .
And a brain-machine interface is not rocket science , it &apos;s just brain research .
It &apos;s nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord , so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously , and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space .
And by doing that , we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical , electronic , or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he , she or it wants to make move , and the device obeys that brain command .
By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors , as you are going to see in a moment , we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted , no matter where -- next to the subject , next door , or across the planet .
And as this message gave feedback back to the brain , the brain realized its goal : to make us move .
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
What you &apos;re listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space .
And to get a reward , a drop of orange juice that monkeys love , this animal has to detect , select one of these objects by touching , not by seeing it , by touching it , because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects , an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object , so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab , and if he does that , he gets a reward without moving a muscle .
The perfect Brazilian lunch : not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice .
So as we saw this happening , we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago .
We reenacted this paper .
We got it out of the drawers , and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility .
The idea was that if you suffered -- and that can happen to any one of us .
Let me tell you , it &apos;s very sudden .
It &apos;s a millisecond of a collision , a car accident that transforms your life completely .
If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord , you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles .
However , your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head .
Paraplegic , quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night .
They have that inside their head .
The problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again .
So what we proposed was , let &apos;s create a new body .
Let &apos;s create a robotic vest .
And that &apos;s exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking , because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic , quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback .
That was the original idea , 15 years ago .
What I &apos;m going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth , dropped their lives , dropped their patents , dropped their dogs , wives , kids , school , jobs , and congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done .
Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup , we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the Germans , of course .
But that &apos;s a different talk , and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that .
But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country , a country that values science and technology , and can give a gift to millions , 25 million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury .
Well , we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed , well , let &apos;s have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball .
They looked at us , thought that we were completely nuts , and said , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s try . &quot;
We had 18 months to do everything from zero , from scratch .
We had no exoskeleton , we had no patients , we had nothing done .
These people came all together and in 18 months , we got eight patients in a routine of training and basically built from nothing this guy , that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1 .
The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever , Alberto Santos Dumont , who , on October 19 , 1901 , created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see .
Sorry , my American friends , I live in North Carolina , but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew on the coast of North Carolina .
Flight control is Brazilian . So we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together , 15 degrees of freedom , hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a non-invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls , the motors , and get it done .
This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by Gordon Cheng , one of my greatest friends , in Munich , to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest , a shirt .
It is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient &apos;s brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him , but it is he who is walking again .
So we got this going , and what you &apos;ll see here is the first time one of our patients , Bruno , actually walked .
And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything , and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed , the computer is going to analyze it , Bruno is going to certify it , and when it is certified , the device starts moving under the command of Bruno &apos;s brain .
And he just got it right , and now he starts walking .
After nine years without being able to move , he is walking by himself .
And more than that -- -- more than just walking , he is feeling the ground , and if the speed of the exo goes up , he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos , the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident .
That &apos;s why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno &apos;s head .
So he walks , and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already -- he says , &quot; You know , guys , I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married , because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself .
Of course , he will have it whenever he wants .
And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup , and couldn &apos;t , because for some mysterious reason , FIFA cut its broadcast in half .
What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd , and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation .
Basically , the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go .
It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback , and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball , you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs , representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen .
And in basically 13 seconds , Juliano actually did .
You can see the commands .
He gets ready , the ball is set , and he kicks .
And the most amazing thing is , 10 seconds after he did that , and looked at us on the pitch , he told us , celebrating as you saw , &quot; I felt the ball . &quot;
And that &apos;s priceless .
So where is this going to go ?
I have two minutes to tell you that it &apos;s going to the limits of your imagination .
Brain-actuating technology is here .
This is the latest : We just published this a year ago , the first brain-to-brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS , a torpedo , a neurophysiological torpedo , to the second animal , and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message , because the message came from the first animal &apos;s brain .
So this is the first demo .
I &apos;m going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest .
But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward .
He goes there and does it .
And the same time , he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn &apos;t see any light , and the second rat , in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina .
Well , we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net , basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before , and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains , synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move .
One monkey is controlling the x dimension , the other monkey is controlling the y dimension .
But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y , the other monkey to control y and z , and the third one to control x and z , and you make them all play the game together , moving the arm in 3D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice .
And they actually do .
The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel , in real time .
That is the definition of a biological computer , interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal .
Where is this going ?
We have no idea .
We &apos;re just scientists .
We are paid to be children , to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there .
But one thing I know : One day , in a few decades , when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking , or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see , or somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass , some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Miguel , thank you for sticking to your time .
I actually would have given you a couple more minutes , because there are a couple of points we want to develop , and , of course , clearly it seems that we need connected brains to figure out where this is going .
So let &apos;s connect all this together .
So if I &apos;m understanding correctly , one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse .
Miguel Nicolelis : No , it &apos;s a little different .
No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys .
They are getting a visual feedback in 2D , but the task they have to accomplish is 3D .
They have to move an arm in three dimensions .
But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls .
And to get that thing done , you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains , but the ideal is three .
So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down , the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back , so this adjusts dynamically , but the global synchrony remains the same .
Now , if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control , like this guy is controlling x and y , but he should be controlling now y and z , instantaneously , that animal &apos;s brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions .
So what I need to say is that no Turing machine , no computer can predict what a brain net will do .
So we will absorb technology as part of us .
Technology will never absorb us .
It &apos;s simply impossible .
How many times have you tested this ?
And how many times have you succeeded versus failed ?
MN : Oh , tens of times .
With the three monkeys ? Oh , several times .
I wouldn &apos;t be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times .
And I forgot to mention , because of time , that just three weeks ago , a European group just demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection .
And how does that play ?
MN : There was one bit of information -- big ideas start in a humble way -- but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object , all non-invasive technology .
So the first subject got a message , like our rats , a visual message , and transmitted it to the second subject .
The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex , or a different pulse , two different pulses .
In one pulse , the subject saw something .
On the other pulse , he saw something different .
And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the Internet across continents .
Moderator : Wow . Okay , that &apos;s where we are going .
That &apos;s the next TED Talk at the next conference .
Miguel Nicolelis , thank you . MN : Thank you , Bruno . Thank you .
It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms , all its colors , aromas and tastes .
But after the food goes through the digestive system , when it is thrown out as crap , it is no longer fashionable to speak about it .
It is rather revolting .
I &apos;m a guy who has graduated from bullshit to full-shit .
My organization , Gram Vikas , which means &quot; village development organization , &quot; was working in the area of renewable energy .
On the most part , we were producing biogas , biogas for rural kitchens .
We produce biogas in India by using animal manure , which usually , in India , is called cow dung .
But as the gender-sensitive person that I am , I would like to call it bullshit .
But realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way , we went into the arena of sanitation .
Eighty percent of all diseases in India and most developing countries are because of poor quality water .
And when we look at the reason for poor quality water , you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste .
Human waste , in its rawest form , finds its way back to drinking water , bathing water , washing water , irrigation water , whatever water you see .
And this is the cause for 80 percent of the diseases in rural areas .
In India , it is unfortunately only the women who carry water .
So for all domestic needs , women have to carry water .
So that is a pitiable state of affairs .
Open defecation is rampant .
Seventy percent of India defecates in the open .
They sit there out in the open , with the wind on their sails , hiding their faces , exposing their bases , and sitting there in pristine glory -- 70 percent of India .
And if you look at the world total , 60 percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians .
A fantastic distinction .
I don &apos;t know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction .
So we , together with a lot of villages , we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation .
And we came together and formed a project called MANTRA .
MANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas .
So we are speaking about transformation , transformation in rural areas .
Villages that agree to implement this project , they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and , later on , who look after the operation and maintenance .
They decide to build a toilet and a shower room .
And from a protected water source , water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps : one in the toilet , one in the shower , one in the kitchen , 24 hours a day .
The pity is that our cities , like New Delhi and Bombay , do not have a 24-hour water supply .
But in these villages , we want to have it .
There is a distinct difference in the quality .
Well in India , we have a theory , which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter , that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions .
This , combined with a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic , is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink .
We are fighting against this .
We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries .
And even in sanitation , they should not be humiliated .
Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste .
And so you build these toilets and very often , we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses .
And you can see that in front are the attached houses and the others are the toilets .
So these people , without a single exception of a family in a village , decide to build a toilet , a bathing room .
And for that , they come together , collect all the local materials -- local materials like rubble , sand , aggregates , usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement , steel , toilet commode .
And they build a toilet and a bathing room .
Also , all the unskilled laborers , that is daily wage earners , mostly landless , are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and plumbers .
So while these people are being trained , others are collecting the materials .
And when both are ready , they build a toilet , a shower room , and of course also a water tower , an elevated water reservoir .
We use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste .
From the toilet , the muck comes into the first leach pit .
And when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
But we discovered that if you plant banana trees , papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits , they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas , papayas .
If any of you come to my place , I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you .
So there you can see the completed toilets , the water towers .
This is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate .
It is always a 24-hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it -- a child dips his or her hand into it , something falls into it .
So no water is stored . It &apos;s always on tap .
This is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed .
And that is the end product .
Because it has to go high , and there is some space available , two or three rooms are made under the water tower , which are used by the village for different committee meetings .
We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program .
Before we started , there were , as usual , more than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases .
But after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages -- 1,200 villages have completed it -- waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
Women usually used to spend , especially in the summer months , about six to seven hours a day carrying water .
And when they went to carry water , because , as I said earlier , it &apos;s only women who carry water , they used to take their little children , girl children , also to carry water , or else to be back at home to look after the siblings .
So there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
And boys , about 30 percent .
But girls , it has gone to about 90 percent and boys , almost to 100 percent .
The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage-earners .
Because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders , now their ability to earn has increased 300 to 400 percent .
So this is a democracy in action because there is a general body , a governing board , the committee .
People are questioning , people are governing themselves , people are learning to manage their own affairs , they are taking their own futures into their hands .
And that is democracy at the grassroots level in action .
More than 1,200 villages have so far done this .
It benefits over 400,000 people and it &apos;s still going on .
And I hope it continues to move ahead .
For India and such developing countries , armies and armaments , software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a lifelong traveler .
Even as a little kid , I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents &apos; house in California .
So , from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole , just to go to school .
And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly , so the very week after I graduated from high school , I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my 18th year on a different continent .
And then , almost inevitably , I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one .
And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you , you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home , and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life .
Except , as you all know , one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it .
You take an angry man to the Himalayas , he just starts complaining about the food .
And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was , oddly , by going nowhere , just by sitting still .
And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives , a break .
But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past .
And so , to my great surprise , I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba .
And by going nowhere , I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season , or even , as some people do , a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most , to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions .
And of course , this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us .
It &apos;s an old idea .
More than 2,000 years ago , the Stoics were reminding us it &apos;s not our experience that makes our lives , it &apos;s what we do with it .
Imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble .
One man is traumatized for life .
But another , maybe even his brother , almost feels liberated , and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew .
It &apos;s exactly the same event , but radically different responses .
There is nothing either good or bad , as Shakespeare told us in &quot; Hamlet , &quot; but thinking makes it so .
And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler .
Twenty-four years ago I took the most mind-bending trip across North Korea .
But the trip lasted a few days .
What I &apos;ve done with it sitting still , going back to it in my head , trying to understand it , finding a place for it in my thinking , that &apos;s lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime .
The trip , in other words , gave me some amazing sights , but it &apos;s only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights .
And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads , in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation , that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind .
Again , none of this is new ; that &apos;s why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago , but Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day .
The Stoics , as far as I know , were not on Facebook .
We all know that in our on-demand lives , one of the things that &apos;s most on demand is ourselves .
Wherever we are , any time of night or day , our bosses , junk-mailers , our parents can get to us .
Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago , but we feel as if we &apos;re working more .
We have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
We can more and more easily make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet , but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves .
And one of my biggest surprises as a traveler has been to find that often it &apos;s exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere .
In other words , precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old , are the ones wisest about the need for limits , even when it comes to technology .
I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about ; the indoor tree houses , the trampolines , workers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering .
But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D. , one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many , many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it , and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine , and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still , or meditation , can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking , but even to emotional intelligence .
I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies , and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine , Kevin Kelly .
And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home .
And like many in Silicon Valley , he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath , whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they &apos;ll need when they go online again .
The one thing perhaps that technology hasn &apos;t always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology .
And when you speak of the sabbath , look at the Ten Commandments -- there &apos;s only one word there for which the adjective &quot; holy &quot; is used , and that &apos;s the Sabbath .
I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah -- its longest chapter , it &apos;s on the Sabbath .
And we all know that it &apos;s really one of our greatest luxuries , the empty space .
In many a piece of music , it &apos;s the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape .
And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe .
Now , in the physical domain , of course , many people , if they have the resources , will try to get a place in the country , a second home .
I &apos;ve never begun to have those resources , but I sometimes remember that any time I want , I can get a second home in time , if not in space , just by taking a day off .
And it &apos;s never easy because , of course , whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that &apos;s going to crash down on me the following day .
I sometimes think I &apos;d rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails .
And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend &apos;s birthday party .
But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet , I realize that it &apos;s only by going there that I &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .
Otherwise , really , I &apos;m just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness , which is no blessing at all .
And so when I was 29 , I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere .
One evening I was coming back from the office , it was after midnight , I was in a taxi driving through Times Square , and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life .
And my life then , as it happened , was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy .
I had really interesting friends and colleagues , I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street .
I had , to me , a fascinating job writing about world affairs , but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think -- or really , to understand if I was truly happy .
And so , I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto , Japan , which was the place that had long exerted a strong , really mysterious gravitational pull on me .
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it ; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it .
But it &apos;s also , as you all know , a beautiful city encircled by hills , filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines , where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more .
And quite soon after I moved there , I ended up where I still am with my wife , formerly our kids , in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle , no car , no TV I can understand , and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist , so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion .
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most , which is days and hours .
I have never once had to use a cell phone there .
I almost never have to look at the time , and every morning when I wake up , really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow .
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises , as it will , more than once , when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression , or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway , I know , in my bones , that it &apos;s the time I &apos;ve spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I &apos;ve spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island .
I &apos;ll always be a traveler -- my livelihood depends on it -- but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world .
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt , Germany , and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes , and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours .
She didn &apos;t once turn on her video monitor , she never pulled out a book , she didn &apos;t even go to sleep , she just sat still , and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me .
I &apos;ve noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives .
Some people go to black-hole resorts where they &apos;ll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival .
Some people I know , just before they go to sleep , instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube , just turn out the lights and listen to some music , and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed .
I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind Los Angeles , where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center .
And I wasn &apos;t entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of &quot; Old Ideas , &quot; went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others .
Something in us , I think , is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that .
who take the time and trouble to sit still .
And I think many of us have the sensation , that we &apos;re standing about two inches away from a huge screen , and it &apos;s noisy and it &apos;s crowded and it &apos;s changing with every second , and that screen is our lives .
And it &apos;s only by stepping back , and then further back , and holding still , that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture .
And a few people do that for us by going nowhere .
So , in an age of acceleration , nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow .
And in an age of distraction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
And in an age of constant movement , nothing is so urgent as sitting still .
So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii , or New Orleans ; I bet you &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
But , if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope , in love with the world , I think you might want to try considering going nowhere .
Thank you .
Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind .
And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
To give you a feel for this idea , imagine the following scenario : You walk into your child &apos;s day care center .
As usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up , but this time , the children &apos;s faces look weirdly similar , and you can &apos;t figure out which child is yours .
Do you need new glasses ?
Are you losing your mind ?
You run through a quick mental checklist .
No , you seem to be thinking clearly , and your vision is perfectly sharp .
And everything looks normal except the children &apos;s faces .
You can see the faces , but they don &apos;t look distinctive , and none of them looks familiar , and it &apos;s only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter .
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people .
It &apos;s called prosopagnosia , and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain .
The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage .
These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components , but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology , especially MRI .
So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution , so I &apos;m going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross-sectional images through a familiar object , and we &apos;re going to fly through them and you &apos;re going to try to figure out what the object is .
Here we go .
It &apos;s not that easy . It &apos;s an artichoke .
Okay , let &apos;s try another one , starting from the bottom and going through the top .
Broccoli ! It &apos;s a head of broccoli .
Isn &apos;t it beautiful ? I love that .
Okay , here &apos;s another one . It &apos;s a brain , of course .
In fact , it &apos;s my brain .
We &apos;re going through slices through my head like that .
That &apos;s my nose over on the right , and now we &apos;re going over here , right there .
So this picture &apos;s nice , if I do say so myself , but it shows only anatomy .
The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity , that is , where neurons are firing .
So here &apos;s how this works .
Brains are like muscles .
When they get active , they need increased blood flow to supply that activity , and lucky for us , blood flow control to the brain is local , so if a bunch of neurons , say , right there get active and start firing , then blood flow increases just right there .
So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase , producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up .
So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can &apos;t , let me describe one of the first studies I ever did .
We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces , so we set out to look for it .
So I was the first subject .
I went into the scanner , I lay on my back , I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours .
So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner , I can tell you that one of the skills that &apos;s really important for MRI research is bladder control .
When I got out of the scanner , I did a quick analysis of the data , that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects , and here &apos;s what I saw .
Now this image looks just awful by today &apos;s standards , but at the time I thought it was beautiful .
What it shows is that region right there , that little blob , it &apos;s about the size of an olive and it &apos;s on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there .
And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response , that is , higher neural activity , when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects .
So that &apos;s pretty cool , but how do we know this isn &apos;t a fluke ?
Well , the easiest way is to just do the experiment again .
So I got back in the scanner , I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob , and then I did it again and around about then I decided to believe it was for real .
But still , maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there , so to find out , we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain .
So the next question was , what does this thing really do ?
Is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
Well , maybe not , right ?
Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part .
Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round .
The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses .
So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images , and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind , and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn &apos;t a face , like some of these .
So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition ?
No , we haven &apos;t .
Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything .
All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts .
To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function , you need to mess with it and see what happens , and normally we don &apos;t get to do that .
But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he &apos;s just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures .
So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area .
So with the patient &apos;s consent , the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain .
Now , the patient doesn &apos;t know where those electrodes are , and he &apos;s never heard of the face area .
So let &apos;s watch what happens .
It &apos;s going to start with a control condition that will say &quot; Sham &quot; nearly invisibly in red in the lower left , when no current is delivered , and you &apos;ll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first . So let &apos;s watch .
Neurologist : Okay , just look at my face and tell me what happens when I do this .
All right ?
Patient : Okay .
Neurologist : One , two , three .
Patient : Nothing . Neurologist : Nothing ? Okay .
I &apos;m going to do it one more time .
Look at my face .
One , two , three .
Patient : You just turned into somebody else .
Your face metamorphosed .
Your nose got saggy , it went to the left .
You almost looked like somebody I &apos;d seen before , but somebody different .
That was a trip .
Nancy Kanwisher : So this experiment ‚Äî ‚Äî this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception .
So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process .
Next , I &apos;ll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found .
So to do this , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain .
So let &apos;s get started . Here &apos;s my right hemisphere .
So we &apos;re oriented like that . You &apos;re looking at my head this way .
Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that .
the surface of the brain is all folded up .
So that &apos;s not good . Stuff could be hidden in there .
We want to see the whole thing , so let &apos;s inflate it so we can see the whole thing .
Next , let &apos;s find that face area I &apos;ve been talking about that responds to images like these .
To see that , let &apos;s turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom , and there it is , that &apos;s my face area . Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information , and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places , like right now , I &apos;m seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active .
There &apos;s another one out on the outside surface again where there &apos;s a couple more face regions as well .
Also in this vicinity is a region that &apos;s selectively involved in processing visual motion , like these moving dots here , and that &apos;s in yellow at the bottom of the brain , and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these , and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain .
Now all these regions I &apos;ve shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception .
Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses , like hearing ?
Yes , we do . So if we turn the brain around a little bit , here &apos;s a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago , and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch , like these .
In contrast , that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don &apos;t have a clear pitch , like these .
Okay . Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
Okay , now let &apos;s look at these same regions .
In my left hemisphere , there &apos;s a similar arrangement ‚Äî not identical , but similar ‚Äî and most of the same regions are in here , albeit sometimes different in size .
Now , everything I &apos;ve shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception , vision and hearing .
Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy , complicated mental processes ?
Yes , we do .
So here in pink are my language regions .
So it &apos;s been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language , but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively .
They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence , but not when you do other complex mental things , like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music .
The most amazing region that &apos;s been found yet is this one right here in turquoise .
This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
So that may seem crazy , but actually , we humans do this all the time .
You &apos;re doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don &apos;t call home to say you &apos;re running late .
I &apos;m doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray , uncharted territory in the brain , and what &apos;s up with that ?
Well , I &apos;m wondering about that too , and we &apos;re running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions .
But importantly , I don &apos;t think we have for every important mental function , even mental functions that may be critical for survival .
In fact , a few years ago , there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he &apos;d found a brain region for detecting food , and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this .
And further , he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects .
So he was pretty stoked , and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on &quot; Oprah &quot; with his big discovery .
But then he devised the critical test : He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape , but that weren &apos;t food , like these .
And his region responded the same to both sets of images .
So it wasn &apos;t a food area , it was just a region that liked colors and shapes .
So much for &quot; Oprah . &quot;
But then the question , of course , is , how do we process all this other stuff that we don &apos;t have specialized brain regions for ?
Well , I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I &apos;ve been describing , we also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along .
In fact , we &apos;ve shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all ‚Äî well , of the seven that we &apos;ve tested .
So each of the brain regions that I &apos;ve described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject .
I could take any of you , pop you in the scanner , and find each of those regions in your brain , and it would look a lot like my brain , although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size .
What &apos;s important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions , but the simple fact that we have selective , specific components of mind and brain in the first place .
I mean , it could have been otherwise .
The brain could have been a single , general-purpose processor , more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife .
Instead , what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind .
So we have this picture of very general-purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components .
It &apos;s early days in this enterprise .
We &apos;ve painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind .
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered .
So for example , what does each of these regions do exactly ?
Why do we need three face areas and three place areas , and what &apos;s the division of labor between them ?
Second , how are all these things connected in the brain ?
With diffusion imaging , you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain , and with this method shown here , you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain , potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain .
Third , how does all of this very systematic structure get built , both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species ?
To address questions like that , scientists are now scanning other species of animals , and they &apos;re also scanning human infants .
Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer &apos;s and autism .
That &apos;s a hugely important goal , and I &apos;d be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it , but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that &apos;s worth doing .
The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease .
What could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience , to understand , in essence , who we are ?
This is , I think , the greatest scientific quest of all time .
When , in 1960 , still a student , I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America .
We traveled the country .
We saw public housing high-rise buildings in all major cities : New York , Philadelphia .
Those who have no choice lived there .
And then we traveled from suburb to suburb , and I came back thinking , we &apos;ve got to reinvent the apartment building .
There has to be another way of doing this .
We can &apos;t sustain suburbs , so let &apos;s design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit .
Habitat would be all about gardens , contact with nature , streets instead of corridors .
We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy , and there it is almost 50 years later .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
It &apos;s now a heritage building , but it did not proliferate .
In 1973 , I made my first trip to China .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
We traveled the country , met with architects and planners .
This is Beijing then , not a single high rise building in Beijing or Shanghai .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
There were hardly any cars .
Thirty years later , this is Beijing today .
This is Hong Kong .
If you &apos;re wealthy , you live there , if you &apos;re poor , you live there , but high density it is , and it &apos;s not just Asia .
S√£o Paulo , you can travel in a helicopter 45 minutes seeing those high-rise buildings consume the 19th-century low-rise environment .
And with it , comes congestion , and we lose mobility , and so on and so forth .
So a few years ago , we decided to go back and rethink Habitat .
Could we make it more affordable ?
Could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities that are prevailing today ?
And we realized , it &apos;s basically about light , it &apos;s about sun , it &apos;s about nature , it &apos;s about fractalization .
Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior ?
We came up with a number of models : economy models , cheaper to build and more compact ; membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens .
And then we decided to take New York as a test case , and we looked at Lower Manhattan .
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
On the left is Manhattan today : blue for housing , red for office buildings , retail .
On the right , we reconfigured it : the office buildings form the base , and then rising 75 stories above , are apartments .
There &apos;s a street in the air on the 25th level , a community street .
It &apos;s permeable .
There are gardens and open spaces for the community , almost every unit with its own private garden , and community space all around .
And most important , permeable , open .
It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city , and light permeates everywhere .
And in the last two or three years , we &apos;ve actually been , for the first time , realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real-life projects across Asia .
This in Qinhuangdao in China : middle-income housing , where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And under construction in Singapore , again middle-income housing , gardens , community streets and parks and so on and so forth .
And Colombo .
And I want to touch on one more issue , which is the design of the public realm .
A hundred years after we &apos;ve begun building with tall buildings , we are yet to understand how the tall high-rise building in creating the public realm .
In Singapore , we had an opportunity : 10 million square feet , extremely high density .
Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor , promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life .
So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces , and you move from one to the other , and there is contact with nature , and most relevantly , at every level of the structure , public gardens and open space : on the roof of the podium , climbing up the towers , and finally on the roof , the sky park , two and a half acres , jogging paths , restaurants , and the world &apos;s longest swimming pool .
And that &apos;s all I can tell you in five minutes . Thank you .
I didn &apos;t know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing .
But when I was told that the topic was language , I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment .
I have a problem .
It &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
I &apos;m fine .
I &apos;m not on fire .
I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with , but for me , language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing .
And the thing is that I have a stutter .
It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage .
One would assume that I &apos;m comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here , speaking to you guys .
But the truth is that I &apos;ve spent my life up until this point and including this point , living in mortal dread of public speaking .
Public singing , whole different thing . But we &apos;ll get to that in a moment .
I &apos;ve never really talked about it before so explicitly .
I think that that &apos;s because I &apos;ve always lived in hope that when I was a grown-up , I wouldn &apos;t have one .
I sort of lived with this idea that when I &apos;m grown , I &apos;ll have learned to speak French , and when I &apos;m grown , I &apos;ll learn how to manage my money , and when I &apos;m grown , I won &apos;t have a stutter , and then I &apos;ll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything &apos;s possible and , you know .
So I can talk about it now because I &apos;ve reached this point , where ‚Äî I mean , I &apos;m 28 .
I &apos;m pretty sure that I &apos;m grown now .
And I &apos;m an adult woman who spends her life as a performer , with a speech impediment .
So , I might as well come clean about it .
There are some interesting angles to having a stutter .
For me , the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer .
This happened to me in Hamburg , when this guy , we met and he said , &quot; Hello , m-m-m-my name is Joe , &quot; and I said , &quot; Oh , hello , m-m-m-my name is Meg . &quot;
Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him .
People think I &apos;m drunk all the time .
People think that I &apos;ve forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it .
And it is a very weird thing , because proper nouns are the worst .
If I &apos;m going to use the word &quot; Wednesday &quot; in a sentence , and I &apos;m coming up to the word , and I can feel that I &apos;m going to stutter or something , I can change the word to &quot; tomorrow , &quot; or &quot; the day after Tuesday , &quot; or something else .
It &apos;s clunky , but you can get away with it , because over time I &apos;ve developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain .
But with people &apos;s names , you can &apos;t change them .
When I was singing a lot of jazz , I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve .
As you can probably gather , S &apos;s and T &apos;s , together or independently , are my kryptonite .
But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp , and when I got around to Steve , I &apos;d often find myself stuck on the &quot; St. &quot;
And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable and it totally kills the vibe .
So after a few instances of this , Steve happily became &quot; Seve , &quot; and we got through it that way . I &apos;ve had a lot of therapy , and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that &apos;s called smooth speech , which is where you almost sing everything that you say .
You kind of join everything together in this very singsong , kindergarten teacher way , and it makes you sound very serene , like you &apos;ve had lots of Valium , and everything is calm . That &apos;s not actually me .
And I do use that . I do .
I use it when I have to be on panel shows , or when I have to do radio interviews , when the economy of airtime is paramount .
I get through it that way for my job .
But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real , that feels often like cheating .
Which is why before I sing , I wanted to tell you what singing means to me .
It &apos;s more than making nice sounds , and it &apos;s more than making nice songs .
It &apos;s more than feeling known , or understood .
It &apos;s more than making you feel the things that I feel .
It &apos;s not about mythology , or mythologizing myself to you .
Somehow , through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain , it &apos;s impossible to stutter when you sing .
And when I was younger , that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me , singing , so I did it a lot .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
Thank you .
Singing for me is sweet relief .
It is the only time when I feel fluent .
It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended .
So I know that this is a TED Talk , but now i &apos;m going to TED sing .
This is a song that I wrote last year .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
I would be a beauty but my nose is slightly too big for my face And I would be a dreamer but my dream is slightly too big for this space And I would be an angel but my halo it pales in the glow of your grace And I would be a joker but that card looks silly when you play your ace I &apos;d like to know Are there stars in hell ? And I &apos;d like to know know if you can tell that you make me lose everything I know That I cannot choose to or not let go And I &apos;d stay forever but my home is slightly too far from this place And I swear I tried to slow it down when I am walking at your pace But all I could think idling through the cities do I look pretty in the rain ? And I don &apos;t know how someone quite so lovely makes me feel ugly So much shame And I &apos;d like to know Are there stars in hell ? And I &apos;d like to know know if you can tell that you make me lose everything I know that I cannot choose to or not let go Thank you very much .
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do : without me , and not online .
On December 10 , 1896 , the man on the medal , Alfred Nobel , died .
One hundred years later , exactly , actually , December 10 , 1996 , this charming lady , Wislawa Szymborska , won the Nobel Prize for literature .
She &apos;s a Polish poet .
She &apos;s a big deal , obviously , but back in &apos; 96 , I thought I had never heard of her , and when I checked out her work , I found this sweet little poem , &quot; Four in the Morning . &quot;
&quot; The hour from night to day .
The hour from side to side .
The hour for those past thirty ... &quot;
And it goes on , but as soon as I read this poem , I fell for it hard , so hard , I suspected we must have met somewhere before .
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem ?
Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere ?
I could not place it , and it bugged me , and then in the coming week or two , I would just be watching an old movie , Groucho Marx : Charlie , you should have come to the first party .
We didn &apos;t get home till around four in the morning .
Rives : My roommates would have the TV on , and this would happen .
George Costanza : Oh boy , I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy .
Rives : I would be listening to music , and this would happen .
Elton John : It &apos;s four o &apos;clock in the morning , damn it . Rives : So you can see what was going on , right ?
Obviously , the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me .
Some people get a number stuck in their head , you may recognize a certain name or a tune , some people get nothing , but four in the morning was in me now , but mildly , like a groin injury .
I always assumed it would just go away and I never talked about it with anybody , but it did not , and I totally did .
In 2007 , I was invited to speak at TED for the second time , and since I was still an authority on nothing , I thought , what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie . So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples , but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year .
I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende .
I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton .
I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening , although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser .
However , had Matt been there , he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble .
It was totally contrived just for that room , just for that moment .
That &apos;s how we did it in the pre-TED.com days .
It was fun . That was pretty much it .
When I got home , though , the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live , beginning with , and this is still my favorite , &quot; Here &apos;s another one for your collection : &apos; It &apos;s the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter . &apos; &quot; The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich .
The email itself was from another very sexy European type , TED Curator Chris Anderson .
Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something , and I &apos;m thinking , this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading , and I have infected him .
I am contagious , which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent with that same quotation .
As a bonus , she hooked me up with a second one they make .
It says , &quot; Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to , &quot; which I love , because together these are like , &quot; Hallmark : When you care enough to send the very best twice , phrased slightly differently . &quot;
I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap .
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out .
&quot; It &apos;s 4 a.m. ‚Äî maybe you &apos;d sleep better if you bought some crap . &quot;
I was surprised at the TEDster / &quot; Rugrats &quot; overlap .
More than one person sent me this .
Didi Pickles : It &apos;s four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding ?
Stu Pickles : Because I &apos;ve lost control of my life .
Rives : And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic .
Roy Neary : Get up , get up ! I &apos;m not kidding . Ronnie Neary : Is there an accident ?
Roy : No , it &apos;s not an accident . You wanted to get out of the house anyway , right ?
Ronnie : Not at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Rives : So that &apos;s &quot; Close Encounters , &quot; and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
Those were all really solid examples .
They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem .
But they followed the pattern . They played along .
Right ? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur .
Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before .
Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something .
Just when things were getting pretty interesting , things got really interesting .
TED.com launched , later that year , with a bunch of videos from past talks , including mine , and I started receiving &quot; four in the morning &quot; citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet .
Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it , and I was not .
I don &apos;t know anybody with juvenile diabetes .
I probably would have missed the booklet , &quot; Grilled Cheese at Four O &apos;Clock in the Morning . &quot;
I do not subscribe to Crochet Today ! magazine , although it looks delightful . Take note of those clock ends .
This is a college student &apos;s suggestion for what a &quot; four in the morning &quot; gang sign People sent me magazine ads .
They took photographs in grocery stores .
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics .
A lot of good quality work , too : &quot; The Sandman , &quot; &quot; Watchmen . &quot;
There &apos;s a very cute example here from &quot; Calvin and Hobbes . &quot;
In fact , the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age .
Take a look .
Wilma Flintstone : Like how early ?
Fred Flintstone : Like at 4 a.m. , that &apos;s how early .
Rives : And the flip side of the timeline , this is from the 31st century .
A thousand years from now , people are still doing this .
: The time is 4 a.m.
Rives : It shows the spectrum .
I received so many songs , TV shows , movies , like from dismal to famous , I could give you a four-hour playlist .
If I just stick to modern male movie stars , I keep it to the length of about a commercial .
Here &apos;s your sampler .
Rives : So somewhere along the line , I realized I have a hobby I didn &apos;t know I wanted , and it is crowdsourced .
But I was also thinking what you might be thinking , with any hour of the day ?
First of all , you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon .
Secondly , I did a little research .
You know , I was kind of interested .
If this is confirmation bias , there is so much confirmation , I am biased .
Literature probably shows it best .
There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare .
There &apos;s a five in the morning .
There are seven four in the mornings , and they &apos;re all very dire .
In &quot; Measure for Measure , &quot; it &apos;s the call time for the executioner .
Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in &quot; War and Peace . &quot;
Charlotte Bront√´ &apos;s &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning , as does Emily Bront√´ &apos;s &quot; Wuthering Heights . &quot;
&quot; Lolita &quot; has as a creepy four in the morning .
&quot; Huckleberry Finn &quot; has one in dialect .
Someone sent in H.G. Wells &apos; &quot; The Invisible Man . &quot;
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison &apos;s &quot; Invisible Man . &quot;
&quot; The Great Gatsby &quot; spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows , and the most famous wake-up in literature , perhaps , &quot; The Metamorphosis . &quot;
First paragraph , the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach , but we already know , cockroach notwithstanding , something is up with this guy .
Why ? His alarm is set for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
What kind of person would do that ?
This kind of person would do that .
Newcaster : Top of the hour . Time for the morning news .
But of course , there is no news yet .
Everyone &apos;s still asleep in their comfy , comfy beds .
Rives : Exactly .
So that &apos;s Lucy from the Peanuts , &quot; Mommie Dearest &quot; , Rocky , first day of training , Nelson Mandela , first day in office , and Bart Simpson , which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category , people waking up , in my big old database .
Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect , say , stuffed polar bears , and they send them to you .
Even if you don &apos;t really , at a certain point , you totally collect stuffed polar bears , and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass .
And when I got to that point , I embraced it .
I got my curator on . I started fact checking , downloading , illegally screen-grabbing .
I started archiving .
My hobby had become a habit , and my habit gave me possibly the world &apos;s most eclectic Netflix queue .
At one point , it went , &quot; Guys and Dolls : The Musical , &quot; &quot; Last Tango in Paris , &quot; &quot; Diary of a Wimpy Kid , &quot; &quot; Porn Star : Legend of Ron Jeremy . &quot;
Why &quot; Porn Star : Legend of Ron Jeremy &quot; ?
Because someone told me I would find this clip in there .
Ron Jeremy : I was born in Flushing , Queens on March , 12 , 1953 , at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Rives : Of course he was . Yeah . Not only does it seem to make sense , it also answers the question , &quot; What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir have in common ? &quot;
Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence , &quot; I was born at four o &apos;clock in the morning , &quot; which I had because someone else had emailed it to me , and when they did , I had another bump up in my entry for this , because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people .
They are different people that have this thing connecting them , and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise , but I did wonder , is there maybe a cooler way to do this ?
So last October , in gentleman scholar tradition , I put the entire collection online as &quot; Museum of Four in the Morning . &quot;
You can click on that red &quot; refresh &quot; button .
It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection .
Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called &quot; Forgetfulness . &quot;
Billy Collins : No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart .
Rives : So the first hour of this project was satisfying .
A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe .
Half a globe away , a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me , a stranger .
Less than a week later , though , I received a little bit of grace .
I received a poignant tweet .
It was brief .
It just said , &quot; Reminds me of an ancient mix tape . &quot;
The name was a pseudonym , actually , or a pseudo-pseudonym .
As soon as I saw the initials , and the profile pic , I knew immediately , my whole body knew immediately who this was , and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about .
L.D. was my college romance .
This is in the early &apos; 90s . I was an undegrad .
She was a grad student in the library sciences department .
Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
She was already smoking hot , she was super dorky , and we had a December-May romance , meaning we started dating in December , and by May , she had graduated and became my one that got away .
But her mix tape did not get away .
I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards , not just from L.D. , from my life , but for decades .
It &apos;s the kind of box where , if I have a girlfriend , I tend to hide it from her , and if I had a wife , I &apos;m sure I would share it with her , but the story ‚Äî ‚Äî with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side , but no song titles .
Instead , L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system , including page numbers , to leave me clues .
When I got this mix tape , I put it in my cassette player , I took it to the campus library , her library , I found 14 books on the shelves .
I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table , and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine , paired , I can tell you , like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress .
I did this again last October .
I &apos;m sitting there , I got new earbuds , old Walkman , I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant .
And then I thought , &quot; Good for him . &quot;
&quot; PG &quot; is Slavic literature .
&quot; 7000 &quot; series Polish literature .
Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems .
Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska &apos;s poem paired with Paul Simon &apos;s &quot; Peace Like a River . &quot;
Paul Simon : Oh , four in the morning I woke up from out of my dream Rives : Thank you . Appreciate it .
Good morning .
When I was a little boy , I had an experience that changed my life , and is in fact why I &apos;m here today .
That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art , design and engineering .
As background , I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world &apos;s great cities .
My dad , John Ferren , who died when I was 15 , was an artist by both passion and profession , as is my mom , Rae .
He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who , together with his contemporaries , invented American modern art , and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century .
Isn &apos;t it remarkable that , after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art , that modern art , comparatively speaking , is about 15 minutes old , yet now pervasive .
As with many other important innovations , those radical ideas required no new technology , just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment , plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection .
In our home , art was everywhere .
It was like oxygen , around us and necessary for life .
As I watched him paint , Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative , but was a different way of communicating ideas , and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight .
Given this rich artistic environment , you &apos;d assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business , but no .
I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy .
I had no interest in becoming an artist , certainly not a painter .
What I did love was electronics and machines -- taking them apart , building new ones , and making them work .
Fortunately , my family also had engineers in it , and with my parents , these were my first role models .
What they all had in common was they worked very , very hard .
My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn .
On weekends , we would go together to Cortlandt Street , which was New York City &apos;s radio row .
There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics , and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers .
I found these objects both useful and fascinating .
I learned about engineering and how things worked , not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices .
I did this for hours every day , apparently avoiding electrocution .
Life was good .
However , every summer , sadly , the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history , art and design .
We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East , but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology , they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum , where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology .
Then , when I was about nine years old , we went to Rome .
On one particularly hot summer day , we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting .
My dad said it was called the Pantheon , a temple for all of the gods .
It didn &apos;t look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : First of all , it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside .
It was very dark , the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof .
Dad explained that this wasn &apos;t a big open hole , but it was called the oculus , an eye to the heavens .
And there was something about this place , I didn &apos;t know why , that just felt special .
As we walked to the center of the room , I looked up at the heavens through the oculus .
This was the first church that I &apos;d been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man .
But I wondered , what about when it rained ?
Dad may have called this an oculus , but it was , in fact , a big hole in the roof .
I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor .
As I became more accustomed to the dark , I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls .
No big deal here , just the same statuary stuff that we &apos;d seen all over Rome .
In fact , it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book , showed it to Hadrian , and Hadrian said , &quot; We &apos;ll take all of it . &quot;
But the ceiling was amazing .
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome .
I &apos;d seen these before , and Bucky was friends with my dad .
It was modern , high-tech , impressive , a huge 142-foot clear span which , not coincidentally , was exactly its height .
I loved this place .
It was really beautiful and unlike anything I &apos;d ever seen before , so I asked my dad , &quot; When was this built ? &quot;
He said , &quot; About 2,000 years ago . &quot;
And I said , &quot; No , I mean , the roof . &quot;
You see , I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s the original roof . &quot;
That moment changed my life , and I can remember it as if it were yesterday .
For the first time , I realized people were smart 2,000 years ago . This had never crossed my mind .
I mean , to me , the pyramids at Giza , we visited those the year before , and sure they &apos;re impressive , nice enough design , but look , give me an unlimited budget , 20,000 to 40,000 laborers , and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside , and I &apos;ll build you pyramids too .
But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon , not 2,000 years ago , nor today .
And incidentally , it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that &apos;s ever been built .
To build the Pantheon took some miracles .
By miracles , I mean things that are technically barely possible , very high-risk , and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time , certainly not by you .
For example , here are some of the Pantheon &apos;s miracles .
To make it even structurally possible , they had to invent super-strong concrete , and to control weight , varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome .
For strength and lightness , the dome structure used five rings of coffers , each of diminishing size , which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design .
It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass , natural convection of air rising up through the oculus , and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building .
I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance .
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable , and I realized for the first time that light could be designed .
Further , that of all of the forms of design , visual design , they were all kind of irrelevant without it , because without light , you can &apos;t see any of them .
I also realized that I wasn &apos;t the first person to think that this place was really special .
It survived gravity , barbarians , looters , developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history .
Largely because of that visit , I came to understand that , contrary to what I was being told in school , the worlds of art and design were not , in fact , incompatible with science and engineering .
I realized , when combined , you could create things that were amazing that couldn &apos;t be done in either domain alone .
But in school , with few exceptions , they were treated as separate worlds , and they still are .
My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other .
However , urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Benjamin Franklin , people who did exactly the opposite .
And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds .
So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen ?
Someone themselves , perhaps Hadrian , needed a brilliant creative vision .
They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it , and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther .
It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles .
The problem is , no matter how talented , rich or smart you are , you only get one to one and a half miracles .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the quota .
Then you run out of time , money , enthusiasm , whatever .
Remember , most people can &apos;t even imagine one of these technical miracles , and you need at least five to make a Pantheon .
In my experience , these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art , design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach .
Driven by the clarity of their vision , they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features .
Take the oculus of the Pantheon .
By insisting that it be in the design , it meant you couldn &apos;t use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches .
However , by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution , they came up with a design that only works if there &apos;s a big hole in the roof .
That done , you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light , cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens .
Not bad .
These people not only believed that the impossible can be done , but that it must be done .
Enough ancient history .
What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now ?
Well , putting a man on the moon was a good one , and returning him safely to Earth wasn &apos;t bad either .
Talk about one giant leap : It &apos;s hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another .
So what came after the moon ?
One is tempted to say that today &apos;s pantheon is the Internet , but I actually think that &apos;s quite wrong , or at least it &apos;s only part of the story .
The Internet isn &apos;t a Pantheon .
It &apos;s more like the invention of concrete : important , absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon , and enduring , but entirely insufficient by itself .
However , just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon , new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure .
The smartphone is a perfect example .
Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one , and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure .
So what &apos;s next ?
What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon ?
Thinking about this , I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come , such as curing cancer .
Why ? Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects , ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them , and will continue to do so indefinitely .
It is a different kind of language , like art .
These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are , of course , critical , and fantastic , but they &apos;re part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology , like the Internet .
So what is next ?
Perhaps counterintuitively , I &apos;m guessing it &apos;s a visionary idea from the late 1930s that &apos;s been revived every decade since : autonomous vehicles .
Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound ?
Look , much of our world has been designed around roads and transportation .
These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States .
Today , these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
Although perhaps not obvious today , autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and , by extension , civilization .
Here &apos;s why : Once they become ubiquitous , each year , these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally .
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically .
Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear .
They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
We will get where we &apos;re going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting .
But why now ? Why do we think this is ready ?
Because over the last 30 years , people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles , but for entirely different purposes .
It took folks like DARPA , universities , and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it , autonomy could be done now .
So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles ?
One , you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is .
This was solved neatly by the GPS system , Global Positioning System , that the U.S. Government put in place .
You need to know where all the roads are , what the rules are , and where you &apos;re going .
The various needs of personal navigation systems , in-car navigation systems , and web-based maps address this .
You must have near-continuous communication with high-performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent .
The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices , with some minor modifications , are completely suitable to solve this .
You &apos;ll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this .
This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there .
But finally , you need to recognize people , signs and objects .
Machine vision , special sensors , and high-performance computing can do a lot of this , but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board .
Occasionally , humans will need to do sense-making .
For this , you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road .
Not so bad , and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world .
Besides , once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant , and it &apos;s okay to keep driving , every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on .
Five miracles , mostly delivered , and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home .
The beginning is now only a handful of years away , and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades .
In conclusion , I &apos;ve come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us , just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge , multidisciplinary skills , and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality .
But these people don &apos;t spontaneously pop into existence .
They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they &apos;re little kids .
We need to love them and help them discover their passions .
We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success , as is perseverance .
We need to help them to find their own role models , and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible , and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus , and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums , we need to encourage them to find their own path , even if it &apos;s very different from our own .
But a cautionary note : We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles , the computers , phones , tablets , game machines and TVs , take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world , our planet and our civilization .
If we don &apos;t , they won &apos;t understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving .
We also need them to understand something that doesn &apos;t seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech-dependent world , that art and design are not luxuries , nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering .
They are in fact essential to what makes us special .
Someday , if you get the chance , perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon , as we will our daughter Kira , to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design , which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome , reached 2,000 years into the future to set the course for my life .
Thank you .
So imagine , you &apos;re in the supermarket , you &apos;re buying some groceries , and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag .
Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment ?
Most people do pick the paper .
Okay , let &apos;s think of why .
It &apos;s brown to start with .
Therefore , it must be good for the environment .
It &apos;s biodegradable . It &apos;s reusable .
In some cases , it &apos;s recyclable .
So when people are looking at the plastic bag , it &apos;s likely they &apos;re thinking of something like this , which we all know is absolutely terrible , and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages .
But people are often not thinking of something like this , which is the other end of the spectrum .
When we produce materials , we need to extract them from the environment , and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts .
You see , what happens is , when we need to make complex choices , us humans like really simple solutions , and so we often ask for simple solutions .
And I work in design .
I advise designers and innovators around sustainability , and everyone always says to me , &quot; Oh Leyla , I just want the eco-materials . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very complex , and we &apos;ll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco-material means , because everything at some point comes from nature , and it &apos;s how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact .
So what happens is , we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions .
So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore .
It &apos;s either the little voice at the back of your head , or it &apos;s that gut feeling you get when you &apos;ve done the right thing , so when you &apos;ve picked the paper bag or when you &apos;ve bought a fuel-efficient car .
And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we &apos;re trying to do the right thing .
But how do we know if we &apos;re actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment ?
So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences , the things we &apos;ve heard from other people .
It doesn &apos;t tend to be based on any scientific framework .
And this is really hard , because we live in incredibly complex systems .
We have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society , We have the industrial systems , which is essentially the entire economy , and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system , and , I would argue , the most important , the ecosystem .
And you see , the choices that we make as an individual , but the choices that we make in every single job that we have , no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order , has an impact on all of these systems .
And the thing is that we have to find ways if we &apos;re actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains .
What we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less .
We have an increasing population , and everybody likes their mobile phones , especially in this situation here .
So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face .
And that &apos;s where this process called life cycle thinking comes in .
So essentially , everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages , and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment , or in America , you guys say life cycle analysis , in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment .
So we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials , and then we look at manufacturing , we look at packaging and transportation , use , and end of life , and at every single one of these stages , the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment , and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on Earth possible .
And through doing this , we &apos;ve learned some absolutely fascinating things .
And we &apos;ve busted a bunch of myths .
So to start with , there &apos;s a word that &apos;s used a lot .
It &apos;s used a lot in marketing , and it &apos;s used a lot , I think , in our conversation when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , and that &apos;s the word biodegradability .
Now biodegradability is a material property ; it is not a definition of environmental benefits .
Allow me to explain .
When something natural , something that &apos;s made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread , even , or any food waste , or even a piece of paper , when something natural ends up in the natural environment , it degrades normally .
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , but this is a net situation .
Most natural things don &apos;t actually end up in nature .
Most of the things , the waste that we produce , end up in landfill .
Landfill is a different environment .
In landfill , those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way , because a landfill is anaerobic .
It &apos;s got no oxygen . It &apos;s tightly compacted and hot .
Those same molecules , they become methane , and methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
So our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials , if they end up in landfill , contribute to climate change .
You see , there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power , displacing the need for fossil fuel power , but we need to be smart about this .
We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems .
Because right now , what people do is they turn around and they say , &quot; Let &apos;s ban plastic bags . We &apos;ll give people paper because that is better for the environment . &quot;
But if you &apos;re throwing it in the bin , and your local landfill facility is just a normal one , then we &apos;re having what &apos;s called a double negative .
I &apos;m a product designer by trade .
I then did social science .
And so I &apos;m absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives have an impact on the natural environment .
And these guys are , like , serial offenders , and I &apos;m pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator .
Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators .
In the last few years , they &apos;ve grown one cubic foot on average , the standard size of a refrigerator .
And the problem is , they &apos;re so big now , it &apos;s easier for us to buy more food that we can &apos;t eat or find .
I mean , I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years , all right ?
And so what happens is , we waste more food .
And as I was just explaining , food waste is a problem .
In fact , here in the U.S. , 40 percent of food purchased for the home is wasted .
Half of the world &apos;s produced food is wasted .
That &apos;s the latest U.N. stats . Up to half of the food .
It &apos;s insane . It &apos;s 1.3 billion tons of food per annum .
And I blame it on the refrigerator , well , especially in Western cultures , because it makes it easier .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of complex systems going on here .
I don &apos;t want to make it so simplistic .
But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this , and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer .
You all got crisper drawers ?
The drawer that you put your lettuces in ?
Lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers , don &apos;t they ?
Yeah ? Soggy lettuces ?
In the U.K. , this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce .
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report .
Okay ? So this is a problem , people .
These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left , right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp .
Okay . You need a tight environment .
You need , like , an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally .
But the crisper drawers , they &apos;re just a drawer with a slightly better seal .
Anyway , I &apos;m clearly obsessed .
Don &apos;t ever invite me over because I &apos;ll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that .
But essentially , this is a big problem .
Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system , not only do we have that impact I just explained at the end of life , but we actually have had to grow that lettuce .
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
We &apos;ve had to clear land .
We &apos;ve had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system , which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge .
So we need to design things like this far better if we &apos;re going to start addressing serious environmental problems .
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size .
For those of you in the room who do design fridges , that would be great .
The problem is , imagine if we actually started to reconsider how we designed things .
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity , but we actually haven &apos;t really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s .
A little bit , but essentially they &apos;re still big boxes , cold boxes that we store stuff in .
So imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems .
This is design-led system change , design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable .
Forty percent food waste is a major problem .
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that .
Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle , which I found out that you don &apos;t do tea kettles in this country , really , do you ?
But that &apos;s really big in the U.K.
Ninety-seven percent of households in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle .
So they &apos;re very popular .
And , I mean , if I were to work with a design firm or a designer , and they were designing one of these , and they wanted to do it eco , they &apos;d usually ask me two things .
They &apos;d say , &quot; Leyla , how do I make it technically efficient ? &quot;
Because obviously energy &apos;s a problem with this product .
Or , &quot; How do I make it green materials ?
How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing ? &quot;
Would you ask me those questions ?
They seem logical , right ? Yeah .
Well I &apos;d say , &quot; You &apos;re looking at the wrong problems . &quot;
Because the problem is with use .
It &apos;s with how people use the product .
Sixty-five percent of Brits admit to over-filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea .
All of this extra water that &apos;s being boiled requires energy , and it &apos;s been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in England for a night .
But this is the thing .
This is what I call a product-person failure .
But we &apos;ve got a product-system failure going on with these little guys , and they &apos;re so ubiquitous , you don &apos;t even notice they &apos;re there .
And this guy over here , though , he does . He &apos;s named Simon .
Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.
He has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody &apos;s homes .
He &apos;s also watching television .
The reason is because there &apos;s a unique phenomenon that happens in the U.K.
the moment that very popular TV shows end .
The minute the ad break comes on , this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France , because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time .
1.5 million kettles , seriously problematic .
So imagine if you designed kettles , you actually found a way to solve these system failures , because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system , just because the product hasn &apos;t thought about the problem that it &apos;s going to have when it exists in the world .
Now , I looked at a number of kettles available on the market , and found the minimum fill lines , so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there , was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water just to make one cup of tea .
So this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs .
One &apos;s a boiling chamber , and one &apos;s the water holder .
The user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled , which means , because we &apos;re all lazy , you only fill exactly what you need .
And this is what I call behavior-changing products : products , systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front .
Now , this is a technology arena , so obviously these things are quite popular , but I think if we &apos;re going to keep designing , buying and using and throwing out which is astronomically high , who live in the world right now .
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year .
Every single year , 1.5 billion mobile phones roll off production lines , and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate .
One hundred fifty-two million phones were thrown out in the U.S. last year ; only 11 percent were recycled .
I &apos;m from Australia . We have a population of 22 million -- don &apos;t laugh -- and it &apos;s been reported that 22 million phones are in people &apos;s drawers .
We need to find ways of solving the problems around this , because these things are so complicated .
They have so much locked up inside them .
Gold ! Did you know that it &apos;s actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore ?
There &apos;s a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things , so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly , because this is otherwise what happens .
This is a community in Ghana , and e-waste is reported , or electronic waste is reported by the U.N.
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
This is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out .
They burn the electronic waste in open spaces .
These are communities , and this is happening all over the world .
And because we don &apos;t see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers , as businesspeople , as consumers , then these kinds of externalities happen , and these are people &apos;s lives .
So we need to find smarter , more systems-based , innovative solutions to these problems , if we &apos;re going to start to live sustainably within this world .
So imagine if , when you bought your mobile phone , your new one because you replaced your old one -- after 15 to 18 months is the average time that people replace their phones , by the way ‚Äî so if we &apos;re going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing , then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems .
The people who produce these phones , and some of which I &apos;m sure are in the room right now , could potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems , or product system services , so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand &apos;s not going to go anywhere , so you design the product to solve the problem .
Design for disassembly , design for light-weighting .
We heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the Tesla Motors car today .
These kinds of approaches are not hard , but understanding the system and then looking for viable , market-driven consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda , because I hate to break it to you all : Consumption is the biggest problem .
But design is one of the best solutions .
These kinds of products are everywhere .
By identifying alternative ways of doing things , we can actually start to innovate , and I say actually start to innovate .
I &apos;m sure everyone in this room is very innovative .
But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter , as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions , because as I &apos;ve just demonstrated with these simple products , they &apos;re participating in these major problems .
So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do .
If you just had paper or plastic -- obviously reusable is far more beneficial -- then the paper is worse , and the paper is worse because it weighs four to 10 times more than the plastic , and when we actually compare , from a life cycle perspective , a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper , the paper is far better , but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material .
It &apos;s done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper .
Because functionality defines environmental impact , and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco-materials .
I say , there &apos;s only a few materials that you should completely avoid .
The rest of them , it &apos;s all about application , and at the end of the day , everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function .
We want something , therefore we buy it .
So breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .
And I &apos;ll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who I work with , a senior designer .
I said , &quot; How come you &apos;re not doing sustainability ? I know you know this . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client , and turned and he said to me , &apos; I know it &apos;s going to cost less , I know it &apos;s going to sell more , but we &apos;re not pioneers , because pioneers have arrows in their backs . &apos; &quot; I think we &apos;ve got a roomful of pioneers , and I hope there are far more pioneers out there , because we need to solve these problems .
Thank you .
For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City , these shots might start to look familiar .
This is Central Park , one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America .
But to anyone who hasn &apos;t visited , these images can &apos;t really fully convey .
To really understand Central Park , you have to physically be there .
Well , the same is true of the music , which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park .
I &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing -- That &apos;s us there . That &apos;s both of us actually ‚Äî specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
Now , my brother and I , we &apos;re musicians and music producers .
We &apos;ve been working together since , well , since we were kids , really .
But recently , we &apos;ve become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect , from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts .
But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space .
But before I go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude did their temporary installation , The Gates , in Central Park .
Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks , and unlike work that &apos;s exhibited in a more neutral space , like on the walls of a gallery or a museum , this was work that was really in dialogue with this place , and in a lot of ways , The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted &apos;s incredible design .
This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time , and years later , my brother and I moved back to Washington , D.C. , and we started to ask the question , would it be possible , in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park , to compose music for a landscape ?
Which brought us to this .
On Memorial Day , we released &quot; The National Mall , &quot; a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device &apos;s built-in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington , D.C.
Hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape , a musical score is actually unfolding around them .
So this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park , but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener &apos;s chosen trajectory .
So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
So using the app , as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument , you hear the sounds of instruments warming up , which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody .
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
Keep walking , and a full choir joins in , until you finally reach the top of the hill and you &apos;re hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness , as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park .
But were you to walk in the opposite direction , this entire sequence happens in reverse .
And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park , the music would fade to silence , and the play button would disappear .
We &apos;re sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can &apos;t travel to the United States , but would like to hear this record .
Well , unlike a normal album , we haven &apos;t been able to accommodate this request .
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version , we just can &apos;t make that happen , and the reason is because this isn &apos;t a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record .
In this case , the app is the work itself , and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience .
Six months later , we did a location-aware album for Central Park , a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall , with music spanning from the Sheep &apos;s Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir .
Currently , my brother and I are working on projects all over the country , but last spring we started a project , here actually at Stanford &apos;s Experimental Media Art Department , where we &apos;re creating our largest location-aware album to date , one that will span the entirety of Highway 1 here on the Pacific Coast .
But what we &apos;re doing , integrating GPS with music , is really just one idea .
But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that &apos;s sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age , that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model , but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music .
Thank you .
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before ?
Okay , a few of you .
When you think of a cave , most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock , and in fact , that &apos;s how most caves are .
Around this half of the country , most of your caves are made of limestone .
Back where I &apos;m from , most of our caves are made of lava rock , because we have a lot of volcanoes out there .
But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice , specifically glacier ice that &apos;s formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon , called Mount Hood .
Now Mount Hood &apos;s only one hour &apos;s drive from Portland , the largest city in Oregon , where over two million people live .
Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it .
The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
Now these days , with so many people hiking around , it &apos;s pretty hard to find a new cave , so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon &apos;s largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before .
It was kind of like being an astronaut , because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before .
So what is a glacier ?
Well , those of you who have ever seen or touched snow , you know that it &apos;s really light , because it &apos;s just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together , and it &apos;s mostly air .
If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball , it gets really small , hard and dense .
Well , on a mountain like Hood , where it snows over 20 feet a year , it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice .
Now each year , more and more ice stacks up on top of it , and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight , forming a slow-moving river of ice .
When ice packed like that starts to move , we call it a glacier , and we give it a name .
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier .
Now each year , as new snow lands on the glacier , it melts in the summer sun , and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice , and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier , forming big networks of caves , sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock .
Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year , new tunnels form .
Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave .
Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down , and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up , gets into the cave , and melts the ceilings back taller and taller .
But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving , because it &apos;s formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that &apos;s slowly sliding down the mountain .
Now this is Brent McGregor , my cave exploration partner .
He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we &apos;ve been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before .
Back in 2011 , Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves .
There were no GPS coordinates for it , and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier .
So in July of that year , we went out on the glacier , and we found a big crack in the ice .
We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole .
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse .
At the end of this hole , we found a huge tunnel underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice .
We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end , and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out .
So how do you map a cave ?
Well , cave maps aren &apos;t like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels .
To make a cave map , you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave , and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations .
Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
Now those of you taking trigonometry , that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there .
In fact , the more I mapped and studied caves , the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be .
So when you &apos;re done surveying , you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well , and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this , and it &apos;ll show you both a bird &apos;s-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage , kind of like an ant farm view .
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow .
Now later this summer , as more snow melted off the glacier , we found more caves , and we realized they were all connected .
Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon , Brent discovered this new cave not very far away .
The inside of it was coated with ice , so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping .
This cave was amazing .
The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up .
And we couldn &apos;t understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why .
There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier .
Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave , freezing everything inside of it .
And we were so excited about finding this new pit , we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it .
It was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
There &apos;s our camp on the left side of this entrance room .
The next morning , we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier , where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time .
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination , I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
So besides really cool ice , what else is inside these caves ?
Well not too much lives in them because they &apos;re so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
But there are some really cool things in there .
There &apos;s weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice .
In fact , this past summer , scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles , tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions , might be living under the ice , kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday .
Another really cool things is that , as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die , they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier , sinking deeper and deeper into the ice .
As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice , they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor , where we end up finding them .
For example , this is a noble fir seed we found .
It &apos;s been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it &apos;s just now starting to sprout .
This mallard duck feather was found over 1,800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave .
This duck died on the surface of the glacier long , long ago , and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave .
And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon .
Even now , Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard , hidden away , just waiting to be found .
Like I said earlier , the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now , but that &apos;s not true .
Every year , new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before .
So it &apos;s actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself .
You just have to be willing to look and go where people don &apos;t often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it , because it might be in your own backyard .
Thank you very much .
For a long time in my life , I felt like I &apos;d been living two different lives .
There &apos;s the life that everyone sees , and then there &apos;s the life that only I see .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that &apos;s what they would tell you .
And that &apos;s a huge part of me . That is who I am .
And if you were to ask me to describe myself , I &apos;d probably say some of those same things .
And I wouldn &apos;t be lying , but I wouldn &apos;t totally be telling you the truth , either , because the truth is , that &apos;s just the life everyone else sees .
In the life that only I see , who I am , who I really am , is someone who struggles intensely with depression .
I have for the last six years of my life , and I continue to every day .
Now , for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn &apos;t really know what that means , that might surprise them to hear , because there &apos;s this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong , when you break up with your girlfriend , when you lose a loved one , when you don &apos;t get the job you wanted .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
Real depression isn &apos;t being sad when something in your life goes wrong .
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
That &apos;s real depression , and that &apos;s what I suffer from .
And to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
It &apos;s hard for me to talk about , and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about , so much so that no one &apos;s talking about it .
And no one &apos;s talking about depression , but we need to be , because right now it &apos;s a massive problem .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
We don &apos;t see it on Facebook . We don &apos;t see it on Twitter .
We don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
And so because we don &apos;t see it , we don &apos;t see the severity of it .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
And we have a tendency , as a society , to look at that and go , &quot; So what ? &quot;
So what ? We look at that , and we go , &quot; That &apos;s your problem .
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
We say we &apos;re sad and we say we &apos;re sorry , but we also say , &quot; So what ? &quot;
Well , two years ago it was my problem , because I sat on the edge of my bed where I &apos;d sat a million times before and I was suicidal .
I was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you wouldn &apos;t see a kid who was suicidal .
You &apos;d see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team , the drama and theater student of the year , the English student of the year , someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party .
So you would say I wasn &apos;t depressed , you would say I wasn &apos;t suicidal , but you would be wrong .
You would be wrong . So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it .
I came this close to doing it .
And I didn &apos;t , so that makes me one of the lucky ones , one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump , one of the lucky ones who survives .
Well , I survived , and that just leaves me with my story , and my story is this : In four simple words , I suffer from depression .
I suffer from depression , and for a long time , I think , I was living two totally different lives , where one person was always afraid of the other .
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was , that I wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought I was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
But for me , for a large part of my life , I feared myself .
I feared my truth , I feared my honesty , I feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner , like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so I thought about that way every single day .
I thought about it every single day , and if I &apos;m being totally honest , standing here I &apos;ve thought about it again since , because that &apos;s the sickness , that &apos;s the struggle , that &apos;s depression , and depression isn &apos;t chicken pox .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
It &apos;s something you live with . It &apos;s something you live in .
It &apos;s the roommate you can &apos;t kick out . It &apos;s the voice you can &apos;t ignore .
It &apos;s the feelings you can &apos;t seem to escape , the scariest part is that after a while , you become numb to it . It becomes normal for you , and what you really fear the most isn &apos;t the suffering inside of you .
It &apos;s the stigma inside of others , it &apos;s the shame , it &apos;s the embarrassment , it &apos;s the disapproving look on a friend &apos;s face , it &apos;s the whispers in the hallway that you &apos;re weak , it &apos;s the comments that you &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
It &apos;s the stigma . So you hold it in and you hide it , and you hold it in and you hide it , and even though it &apos;s keeping you in bed every day and it &apos;s making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it , you hide it , because the stigma in our society around depression is very real .
It &apos;s very real , and if you think that it isn &apos;t , ask yourself this : Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you &apos;re depressed ?
That &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
That &apos;s the stigma .
We are so , so , so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains . And that &apos;s ignorance .
That &apos;s pure ignorance , and that ignorance has created a world that doesn &apos;t understand depression , that doesn &apos;t understand mental health .
And that &apos;s ironic to me , because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world , yet it &apos;s one of the least discussed .
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it &apos;s not there and hope it &apos;ll fix itself .
Well , it won &apos;t . It hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one .
Well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
I wish I did , but I don &apos;t -- but I think , I think it has to start here .
It has to start with me , it has to start with you , it has to start with the people who are suffering , the ones who are hidden in the shadows .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in , because if there &apos;s one thing that I &apos;ve come to realize , if there &apos;s one thing that I see as the biggest problem , it &apos;s not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others .
It &apos;s in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves , where we &apos;re okay with who we are , because when we get honest , we see that we all struggle and we all suffer .
Whether it &apos;s with this , whether it &apos;s with something else , we all know what it is to hurt .
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart , and we all know how important it is to heal .
But right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
Well , it is there . It is there , and you know what ? It &apos;s okay .
Depression is okay . If you &apos;re going through it , know that you &apos;re okay .
And know that you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not weak , and it &apos;s an issue , not an identity , because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others , you can see depression for what it really is , and that &apos;s just a part of life , just a part of life , and as much as I hate , as much as I hate some of the places , some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to , in a lot of ways I &apos;m grateful for it .
Because yeah , it &apos;s put me in the valleys , but only to show me there &apos;s peaks , and yeah it &apos;s dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light .
My pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be .
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn &apos;t mean ignoring your dark .
The world I believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say , &quot; I &apos;m going through hell , &quot; and they can look back at me and go , &quot; Me too , &quot; and that &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay because depression is okay . We &apos;re people .
We &apos;re people , and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry , and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness , then I &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re wrong .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
So we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we &apos;re going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you . Thank you .
I &apos;m going to share with you a paradigm-shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence -- sexual assault , domestic violence , relationship abuse , sexual harassment , sexual abuse of children .
That whole range of issues that I &apos;ll refer to in shorthand as &quot; gender violence issues , &quot; they &apos;ve been seen as women &apos;s issues that some good men help out with , but I have a problem with that frame and I don &apos;t accept it .
I don &apos;t see these as women &apos;s issues that some good men help out with .
In fact , I &apos;m going to argue that these are men &apos;s issues , first and foremost .
Now obviously , they &apos;re also women &apos;s issues , so I appreciate that , but calling gender violence a women &apos;s issue is part of the problem , for a number of reasons .
The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention .
Right ? A lot of men hear the term &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; and we tend to tune it out , and we think , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m a guy . That &apos;s for the girls , &quot; or &quot; That &apos;s for the women . &quot;
And a lot of men literally don &apos;t get beyond the first sentence as a result .
It &apos;s almost like a chip in our brain is activated , and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term &quot; women &apos;s issues . &quot;
This is also true , by the way , of the word &quot; gender , &quot; because a lot of people hear the word &quot; gender &quot; and they think it means &quot; women . &quot;
So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women &apos;s issues .
There &apos;s some confusion about the term gender .
And actually , let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy .
So let &apos;s talk for a moment about race .
In the U.S. , when we hear the word &quot; race , &quot; a lot of people think that means African-American , Latino , Asian-American , Native American , South Asian , Pacific Islander , on and on .
A lot of people , when they hear the word &quot; sexual orientation &quot; think it means gay , lesbian , bisexual .
And a lot of people , when they hear the word &quot; gender , &quot; think it means women . In each case , the dominant group doesn &apos;t get paid attention to .
Right ? As if white people don &apos;t have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct , as if heterosexual people don &apos;t have a sexual orientation , as if men don &apos;t have a gender .
This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves , which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance , because that &apos;s one of the key characteristics of power and privilege , the ability to go unexamined , lacking introspection , in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us .
And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence , how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men .
And I &apos;m going to illustrate what I &apos;m talking about by using the old tech .
I &apos;m old school on some fundamental regards .
I work with -- I make films -- and I work with high tech , but I &apos;m still old school as an educator , and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the sentence structure level how the way that we think , literally the way that we use language , conspires to keep our attention off of men .
This is about domestic violence in particular , but you can plug in other analogues .
This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope .
It starts with a very basic English sentence : &quot; John beat Mary . &quot;
That &apos;s a good English sentence .
John is the subject . Beat is the verb .
Mary is the object . Good sentence .
Now we &apos;re going to move to the second sentence , which says the same thing in the passive voice .
&quot; Mary was beaten by John . &quot;
And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence .
We &apos;ve gone from &quot; John beat Mary &quot; to &quot; Mary was beaten by John . &quot;
We &apos;ve shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary , and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence , well , close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain .
The third sentence , John is dropped , and we have , &quot; Mary was beaten , &quot; and now it &apos;s all about Mary .
We &apos;re not even thinking about John . It &apos;s totally focused on Mary .
Over the past generation , the term we &apos;ve used synonymous with &quot; beaten &quot; is &quot; battered , &quot; so we have &quot; Mary was battered . &quot;
And the final sentence in this sequence , flowing from the others , is , &quot; Mary is a battered woman . &quot;
So now Mary &apos;s very identity -- Mary is a battered woman -- is what was done to her by John in the first instance .
But we &apos;ve demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation .
Now , those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim-blaming is pervasive in this realm , which is to say , blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it .
And we say things like , why do these women go out with these men ?
Why are they attracted to these men ?
Why do they keep going back ? What was she wearing at that party ?
What a stupid thing to do . Why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room ?
This is victim blaming , and there are numerous reasons for it , but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims . This is all unconscious .
Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women &apos;s choices and what they &apos;re doing , thinking , and wearing .
And I &apos;m not going to shout down people who ask questions about women , okay ? It &apos;s a legitimate thing to ask .
But &apos;s let &apos;s be clear : Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence .
We have to ask a different set of questions .
You can see where I &apos;m going with this , right ?
The questions are not about Mary . They &apos;re about John .
The questions include things like , why does John beat Mary ?
Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the United States and all over the world ?
What &apos;s going on ? Why do so many men abuse , physically , emotionally , verbally , and other ways , the women and girls , and the men and boys , that they claim to love ? What &apos;s going on with men ?
Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys ?
Why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today ?
Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America , on and on and on ?
And then local communities all over the country and all over the world , right ? We hear about it all the time .
The sexual abuse of children .
What &apos;s going on with men ? Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world ?
Why do so many men rape other men ?
What is going on with men ?
And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates ?
Because this isn &apos;t about individual perpetrators .
That &apos;s a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem .
You know , the perpetrators aren &apos;t these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness .
That &apos;s a very naive notion , right ?
Perpetrators are much more normal than that , and everyday than that .
So the question is , what are we doing here in our society and in the world ?
What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men ?
What &apos;s the role of religious belief systems , the sports culture , the pornography culture , the family structure , economics , and how that intersects , and race and ethnicity and how that intersects ?
How does all this work ?
And then , once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions , then we can talk about how we can be transformative , in other words , how can we do something differently ?
How can we change the practices ?
How can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes ?
These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing , but if we &apos;re endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere , we &apos;re not going to get to that piece .
Now , I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues , today and yesterday and for years and years , often get shouted down for their efforts .
They get called nasty names like &quot; male-basher &quot; and &quot; man-hater , &quot; and the disgusting and offensive &quot; feminazi . &quot; Right ?
And you know what all this is about ?
It &apos;s called kill the messenger .
It &apos;s because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys , it &apos;s a statement to them to sit down and shut up , keep the current system in place , because we don &apos;t like it when people rock the boat .
We don &apos;t like it when people challenge our power .
You &apos;d better sit down and shut up , basically .
And thank goodness that women haven &apos;t done that .
Thank goodness that we live in a world where there &apos;s so much women &apos;s leadership that can counteract that .
But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can &apos;t say , or , better yet , we can be heard saying some things that women often can &apos;t be heard saying .
Now , I appreciate that that &apos;s a problem . It &apos;s sexism .
But it &apos;s the truth . And so one of the things that I say to men , and my colleagues and I always say this , is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff , and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense .
We live in the world together .
And by the way , one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women &apos;s and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow , like I said , that they &apos;re anti-male .
What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother , themselves , their sisters ?
What about all those boys ?
What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men &apos;s violence ?
You know what ? The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men .
And if we want to talk about male victims , let &apos;s talk about male victims .
Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men &apos;s violence .
So that &apos;s something that both women and men have in common .
We are both victims of men &apos;s violence .
So we have it in our direct self-interest , not to mention the fact that most men that I know have women and girls that we care deeply about , in our families and our friendship circles and every other way .
So there &apos;s so many reasons why we need men to speak out .
It seems obvious saying it out loud . Doesn &apos;t it ?
Now , the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the U.S. military , in schools , we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention .
And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach , because it &apos;s a big thematic shift , although there &apos;s lots of particulars , but the heart of it is , instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims , or women as perpetrators , men as victims , or any combination in there .
I &apos;m using the gender binary . I know there &apos;s more than men and women , there &apos;s more than male and female .
And there are women who are perpetrators , and of course there are men who are victims .
There &apos;s a whole spectrum .
But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion , we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders , and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation , so in other words friends , teammates , colleagues , coworkers , family members , those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse , but we are embedded in social , family , work , school , and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation . What do we do ?
How do we speak up ? How do we challenge our friends ?
How do we support our friends ? But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse ?
Now , when it comes to men and male culture , the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are .
And when I say abusive , I don &apos;t mean just men who are beating women .
We &apos;re not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack .
That &apos;s a naive way of creating a social change .
It &apos;s along a continuum , we &apos;re trying to get men to interrupt each other .
So , for example , if you &apos;re a guy and you &apos;re in a group of guys playing poker , talking , hanging out , no women present , and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women , instead of laughing along or pretending you didn &apos;t hear it , we need men to say , &quot; Hey , that &apos;s not funny .
You know , that could be my sister you &apos;re talking about , and could you joke about something else ?
Or could you talk about something else ?
I don &apos;t appreciate that kind of talk . &quot;
Just like if you &apos;re a white person and another white person makes a racist comment , you &apos;d hope , I hope , that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person .
Just like with heterosexism , if you &apos;re a heterosexual person and you yourself don &apos;t enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations , if you don &apos;t say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that , then , in a sense , isn &apos;t your silence a form of consent and complicity ?
Well , the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable , not just because it &apos;s illegal , but because it &apos;s wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture .
And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status , young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women , as well as towards other boys and men , will lose status as a result of it , guess what ?
We &apos;ll see a radical diminution of the abuse .
Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted .
He &apos;s a normal guy in every other way . Isn &apos;t he ?
Now , among the many great things that Martin Luther King said in his short life was , &quot; In the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . &quot;
In the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
There &apos;s been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men &apos;s violence against women and children , hasn &apos;t there ?
There &apos;s been an awful lot of silence .
And all I &apos;m saying is that we need to break that silence , and we need more men to do that .
Now , it &apos;s easier said than done , because I &apos;m saying it now , but I &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other , which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men &apos;s issues , but they &apos;re also leadership issues for men .
Because ultimately , the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men . It should be on adult men with power .
Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues , because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts , he or she is being a leader , really , right ?
But on a big scale , we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues , and we haven &apos;t seen that yet , have we ?
Now , I was at a dinner a number of years ago , and I work extensively with the U.S. military , all the services .
And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me -- I think she thought she was a little clever -- she said , &quot; So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; With all due respect , I don &apos;t do sensitivity training with the Marines .
I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps . &quot;
Now , I know it &apos;s a bit pompous , my response , but it &apos;s an important distinction , because I don &apos;t believe that what we need is sensitivity training .
We need leadership training , because , for example , when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team -- and I work extensively in that realm as well -- makes a sexist comment , makes a homophobic statement , makes a racist comment , there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio .
And some people will say , &quot; Well , he needs sensitivity training . &quot;
And other people will say , &quot; Well get off it .
You know , that &apos;s political correctness run amok , and he made a stupid statement . Move on . &quot;
My argument is , he doesn &apos;t need sensitivity training .
He needs leadership training , because he &apos;s being a bad leader , because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity -- ‚Äî and racial and ethnic diversity , you make those kind of comments , you &apos;re failing at your leadership .
If we can make this point that I &apos;m making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power , it &apos;s going to change , it &apos;s going to change the paradigm of people &apos;s thinking .
You know , for example , I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America .
We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence , right ?
There &apos;s no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes , coaches , administrators , as part of their educational process .
We know enough to know that we can easily do that .
But you know what &apos;s missing ? The leadership .
But it &apos;s not the leadership of student athletes .
It &apos;s the leadership of the athletic director , the president of the university , the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings .
That &apos;s a failure , in most cases , of men &apos;s leadership .
Look at Penn State . Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach .
You had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children , in this case , boys .
It &apos;s unbelievable , really . But when you get into it , you realize there are pressures on men .
There are constraints within peer cultures on men , which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures .
And one of the ways to do that is to say there &apos;s an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues .
I know this . I work with men , and I &apos;ve been working with tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of men for many , many decades now .
It &apos;s scary , when you think about it , how many years .
But there &apos;s so many men who care deeply about these issues , but caring deeply is not enough .
We need more men with the guts , with the courage , with the strength , with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them .
By the way , we owe it to women .
There &apos;s no question about it .
But we also owe it to our sons .
We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn &apos;t make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way .
They didn &apos;t make the choice .
We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well .
I hope that , going forward , men and women , working together , can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won &apos;t have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis .
I know we can do it . We can do better .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a little nervous , because my wife Yvonne said to me , she said , &quot; Geoff , you watch the TED Talks . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , honey , I love TED Talks . &quot;
She said , &quot; You know , they &apos;re like , really smart , talented -- &quot; I said , &quot; I know , I know . &quot; She said , &quot; They don &apos;t want , like , the angry black man . &quot;
So I said , &quot; No , I &apos;m gonna be good , Honey , I &apos;m gonna be good . I am . &quot;
But I am angry . And the last time I looked , I &apos;m -- So this is why I &apos;m excited but I &apos;m angry .
This year , there are going to be millions of our children that we &apos;re going to needlessly lose , that we could -- right now , we could save them all .
You saw the quality of the educators who were here .
Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them . I know they could .
It is absolutely possible .
Why haven &apos;t we fixed this ?
Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don &apos;t care how many millions of young people fail , we &apos;re going to continue to do the same thing that didn &apos;t work , and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right ? -- enough to say , &quot; Enough is enough . &quot;
So here &apos;s a business plan that simply does not make any sense .
You know , I grew up in the inner city , and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school , and those schools are still lousy today , 56 years later .
And you know something about a lousy school ?
It &apos;s not like a bottle of wine .
Right ? Where you say , like , &apos; 87 was like a good year , right ?
That &apos;s now how this thing -- I mean , every single year , it &apos;s still the same approach , right ?
One size fits all , if you get it , fine , and if you don &apos;t , tough luck . Just tough luck .
Why haven &apos;t we allowed innovation to happen ?
Do not tell me we can &apos;t do better than this .
Look , you go into a place that &apos;s failed kids for 50 years , and you say , &quot; So what &apos;s the plan ? &quot;
And they say , &quot; We &apos;ll , we &apos;re going to do what we did last year this year . &quot;
What kind of business model is that ?
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3 .
They operated 10 to 3 . They were closed for lunch hour .
Now , who can bank between 10 and 3 ? The unemployed .
They don &apos;t need banks . They got no money in the banks .
Who created that business model ? Right ?
And it went on for decades .
You know why ? Because they didn &apos;t care .
It wasn &apos;t about the customers .
It was about bankers . They created something that worked for them .
How could you go to the bank when you were at work ? It didn &apos;t matter .
And they don &apos;t care whether or not Geoff is upset he can &apos;t go to the bank . Go find another bank .
They all operate the same way . Right ?
Now , one day , some crazy banker had an idea .
Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work .
They might like that . What about a Saturday ?
What about introducing technology ?
Now look , I &apos;m a technology fan , but I have to admit to you all I &apos;m a little old .
So I was a little slow , and I did not trust technology , and when they first came out with those new contraptions , these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money , I was like , &quot; There &apos;s no way that machine is going to count that money right .
I am never using that , right ? &quot;
So technology has changed . Things have changed .
Yet not in education . Why ?
Why is it that when we had rotary phones , when we were having folks being crippled by polio , that we were teaching the same way then that we &apos;re doing right now ?
And if you come up with a plan to change things , people consider you radical .
They will say the worst things about you .
I said one day , well , look , if the science says -- this is science , not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say , okay , they &apos;re there .
You look at them in September , they &apos;ve gone down .
You say , whoo ! So I heard about that in &apos; 75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard .
I said , &quot; Oh , wow , this is an important study . &quot;
Because it suggests we should do something .
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study .
It says exactly the same thing : Poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
The system decides you can &apos;t run schools in the summer .
You know , I always wonder , who makes up those rules ?
For years I went to -- Look , I went the Harvard Ed School .
I thought I knew something .
They said it was the agrarian calendar , and people had ‚Äî but let me tell you why that doesn &apos;t make sense .
I never got that . I never got that , because anyone knows if you farm , you don &apos;t plant crops in July and August .
You plant them in the spring .
So who came up with this idea ? Who owns it ?
Why did we ever do it ?
Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have , schools were open all year . They were open all year , because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day .
They didn &apos;t have any place for their kids to go .
It was a perfect place to have schools .
So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods .
So why don &apos;t we ? Why don &apos;t we ?
Because our business has refused to use science .
Science . You have Bill Gates coming out and saying , &quot; Look , this works , right ? We can do this . &quot;
How many places in America are going to change ? None .
None . Okay , yeah , there are two . All right ?
Yes , there &apos;ll be some place , because some folks will do the right thing .
As a profession , we have to stop this . The science is clear .
Here &apos;s what we know .
We know that the problem begins immediately .
Right ? This idea , zero to three .
My wife , Yvonne , and I , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
That &apos;s a longer story .
With our first kids , we did not know the science about brain development .
We didn &apos;t know how critical those first three years were .
We didn &apos;t know what was happening in those young brains .
We didn &apos;t know the role that language , a stimulus and response , call and response , how important that was in developing those children .
We know that now . What are we doing about it ? Nothing .
Wealthy people know . Educated people know .
And their kids have an advantage .
Poor people don &apos;t know , and we &apos;re not doing anything to help them at all .
But we know this is critical .
Now , you take pre-kindergarten .
We know it &apos;s important for kids .
Poor kids need that experience .
Nope . Lots of places , it doesn &apos;t exist .
We know health services matter .
You know , we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about , you know , because I &apos;m all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff , but we do health services , and I have to raise a lot of money .
People used to say when they &apos;d come fund us , &quot; Geoff , why do you provide these health services ? &quot;
I used to make stuff up . Right ?
I &apos;d say , &quot; Well , you know a child who has cavities is not going to , uh , be able to study as well . &quot;
And I had to because I had to raise the money .
But now I &apos;m older , and you know what I tell them ?
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts ?
Because I actually like kids .
I actually like kids . But when they really get pushy , people really get pushy , I say , &quot; I do it because you do it for your kid . &quot;
And you &apos;ve never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better , but you will give that kid dance instruction , and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction , and it will make your day . And why shouldn &apos;t poor kids have the same opportunity ? It &apos;s the floor for these children .
So here &apos;s the other thing .
I &apos;m a tester guy . I believe you need data , you need information , because you work at something , you think it &apos;s working , and you find out it &apos;s not working .
I mean , you &apos;re educators . You work , you say , you think you &apos;ve got it , great , no ? And you find out they didn &apos;t get it .
But here &apos;s the problem with testing .
The testing that we do -- we &apos;re going to have our test in New York next week ‚Äî is in April .
You know when we &apos;re going to get the results back ?
Maybe July , maybe June .
And the results have great data .
They &apos;ll tell you Raheem really struggled , couldn &apos;t do two-digit multiplication -- so great data , but you &apos;re getting it back after school is over .
And so , what do you do ?
You go on vacation . You come back from vacation .
Now you &apos;ve got all of this test data from last year .
You don &apos;t look at it .
Why would you look at it ?
You &apos;re going to go and teach this year .
So how much money did we just spend on all of that ?
Billions and billions of dollars for data that it &apos;s too late to use .
I need that data in September .
I need that data in November .
I need to know you &apos;re struggling , and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that .
I need to know that this week .
I don &apos;t need to know that at the end of the year when it &apos;s too late .
Because in my older years , I &apos;ve become somewhat of a clairvoyant .
I can predict school scores .
You take me to any school .
I &apos;m really good at inner city schools that are struggling .
And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level .
And I say , &quot; Okay , what &apos;s the plan , what did we do from last year to this year ? &quot;
You say , &quot; We &apos;re doing the same thing . &quot;
I &apos;m going to make a prediction . This year , somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level .
And I will be right every single time .
So we &apos;re spending all of this money , but we &apos;re getting what ?
Teachers need real information right now about what &apos;s happening to their kids .
The high stakes is today , because you can do something about it .
So here &apos;s the other issue that I just think we &apos;ve got to be concerned about .
We can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
We have to innovate . And people in our business get mad about innovation .
They get angry if you do something different .
If you try something new , people are always like , &quot; Ooh , charter schools . &quot; Hey , let &apos;s try some stuff . Let &apos;s see .
This stuff hasn &apos;t worked for 55 years .
Let &apos;s try something different . And here &apos;s the rub .
Some of it &apos;s not going to work .
You know , people tell me , &quot; Yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them don &apos;t work . &quot;
A lot of them don &apos;t . They should be closed .
I mean , I really believe they should be closed .
But we can &apos;t confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn &apos;t therefore do anything .
Right ? Because that &apos;s not the way the world works .
If you think about technology , imagine if that &apos;s how we thought about technology .
Every time something didn &apos;t work , we just threw in the towel and said , &quot; Let &apos;s forget it . &quot; Right ?
You know , they convinced me . I &apos;m sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing , the PalmPilot .
They told me , &quot; Geoff , if you get this PalmPilot you &apos;ll never need another thing . &quot;
That thing lasted all of three weeks . It was over .
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing .
Did anybody stop inventing ? Not a person . Not a soul .
The folks went out there . They kept inventing .
The fact that you have failure , that shouldn &apos;t stop you from pushing the science forward .
Our job as educators , there &apos;s some stuff we know that we can do .
And we &apos;ve got to do better . The evaluation , we have to start with kids earlier , we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people .
We &apos;ve got to give them all of these opportunities .
So that we have to do . But this innovation issue , this idea that we &apos;ve got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical .
And this is something , by the way , that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field .
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right .
We have run out of time .
I don &apos;t know about a fiscal cliff , but I know there &apos;s an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second , and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can &apos;t afford this ‚Äî So Bill Gates says it &apos;s going to cost five billion dollars .
What is five billion dollars to the United States ?
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year ?
How many trillions ? When the country cares about something , we &apos;ll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye .
When the safety of America is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about .
I dare say it &apos;s a pittance , what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems .
So once we do that , I &apos;ll no longer be angry . So , you guys , help me get there .
Thank you all very much . Thank you .
John Legend : So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children &apos;s Zone ?
Geoffrey Canada : Well , you know , John , 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school .
A hundred percent of them went to college .
This year &apos;s seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school .
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
We &apos;d better get that other seven percent .
So that &apos;s just how this goes . JL : So how do you stick with them after they leave high school ?
GC : Well , you know , one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids , the same kids , these same vulnerable kids , when you get them in school , they drop out in record numbers .
And so we &apos;ve figured out that you &apos;ve got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does .
They harass you , right ? They call you , they say , &quot; I want to see your grades . How &apos;d you do on that last test ?
What are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
And you &apos;re not coming back here . &quot;
So a bunch of my kids know you can &apos;t come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you .
They &apos;re like , &quot; I really can &apos;t come back . &quot; No . You &apos;d better stay in school .
But I &apos;m not kidding about some of this , and it gets a little bit to the grit issue .
When kids know that you refuse to let them fail , it puts a different pressure on them , and they don &apos;t give up as easy .
So sometimes they don &apos;t have it inside , and they &apos;re , like , &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to do this , but I know my mother &apos;s going to be mad . &quot;
Well , that matters to kids , and it helps get them through .
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support , but also a set of encouragements that say to them , &quot; You can do it . It is going to be hard , but we refuse to let you fail . &quot;
JL : Well , thank you Dr. Canada .
Please give it up for him one more time .
So I &apos;ll be talking about the success of my campus , the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , UMBC , in educating students of all types , across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas .
What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder -- students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .
And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African-American students , Latino students , students from low-income backgrounds , to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering .
And so I begin with a story about my childhood .
We all are products of our childhood experiences .
It &apos;s hard for me to believe that it &apos;s been 50 years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham , Alabama , a kid who loved getting A &apos;s , a kid who loved math , who loved to read , a kid who would say to the teacher -- when the teacher said , &quot; Here are 10 problems , &quot; to the class , this little fat kid would say , &quot; Give us 10 more . &quot;
And the whole class would say , &quot; Shut up , Freeman . &quot;
And there was a designated kicker every day .
And so I was always asking this question : &quot; Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn ? &quot;
And amazingly , one week in church , when I really didn &apos;t want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems , I heard this man say this : &quot; If we can get the children to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham , we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children really do want to get the best possible education . &quot;
And I looked up and said , &quot; Who is that man ? &quot;
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King .
And I said to my parents , &quot; I &apos;ve got to go .
I want to go . I want to be a part of this . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
And we had a rough go of it .
And at that time , quite frankly , you really did not talk back to your parents .
And somehow I said , &quot; You know , you guys are hypocrites .
You make me go to this . You make me listen .
The man wants me to go , and now you say no . &quot;
And they thought about it all night .
And they came into my room the next morning .
They had not slept .
They had been literally crying and praying and thinking , &quot; Will we let our 12-year-old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail ? &quot;
And they decided to do it .
And when they came in to tell me , I was at first elated .
And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses , and I got really scared , I really did .
And one of the points I make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous , it doesn &apos;t really mean that they &apos;re that courageous .
It simply means that they believe it &apos;s important to do it .
I wanted a better education .
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books .
I wanted to know that the school I attended not only had good teachers , but the resources we needed .
And as a result of that experience , in the middle of the week , while I was there in jail , Dr. King came and said with our parents , &quot; What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born . &quot;
I recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today had not been born at the time of 1963 .
And so for them , when they hear about the Children &apos;s Crusade in Birmingham , in many ways , if they see it on TV , it &apos;s like our looking at the 1863 &quot; Lincoln &quot; movie : It &apos;s history .
And the real question is , what lessons did we learn ?
Well amazingly , the most important for me was this : That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education .
They can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions .
And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead , the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , UMBC , was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King , in 1963 .
And what made that institutional founding especially important is that Maryland is the South , as you know , and , quite frankly , it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there .
And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend .
And it has been for 50 years an experiment .
The experiment is this : Is it possible to have institutions in our country , universities , where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience ?
Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this : We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences .
And so we began to work on that , for years in the &apos; 60s .
And we produced a number of people in law , all the way to the humanities .
We produced great artists . Beckett is our muse .
A lot of our students get into theater .
It &apos;s great work .
The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face -- that students in the sciences and engineering , black students were not succeeding .
But when I looked at the data , what I found was that , quite frankly , students in general , large numbers were not making it .
And as a result of that , we decided to do something that would help , first of all , the group at the bottom , African-American students , and then Hispanic students .
And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff , philanthropists , said , &quot; We &apos;d like to help . &quot;
Robert Meyerhoff said , &quot; Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys , if it &apos;s not about basketball , is not positive ?
I &apos;d like to make a difference , to do something that &apos;s positive . &quot;
We married those ideas , and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program .
And what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things .
And the question is this : How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans who go on to complete Ph.D. &apos; s in science and engineering and M.D. / Ph.D. &apos; s ?
That &apos;s a big deal . Give me a hand for that . That &apos;s a big deal .
That &apos;s a big deal . It really is .
You see , most people don &apos;t realize that it &apos;s not just minorities who don &apos;t do well in science and engineering .
Quite frankly , you &apos;re talking about Americans .
If you don &apos;t know it , while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering , only 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in those areas , and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans .
And so , the real question is , what is the challenge ?
Well a part of it , of course , is K-12 .
We need to strengthen K-12 .
But the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our campuses .
Whether you know it or not , large numbers of students with high SAT &apos;s and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering , and they end up changing their majors .
And the number one reason , we find , quite frankly , is they did not do well in first year science courses .
In fact , we call first year science and engineering , typically around America , weed-out courses or barrier courses .
How many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre-med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two ?
It &apos;s an American challenge . Half of you in the room .
I know . I know . I know .
And what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it .
We need to find ways of making it happen .
So what are the four things we did to help minority students that now are helping students in general ?
Number one : high expectations .
It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students -- their grades , the rigor of the course work , their test-taking skills , their attitude , the fire in their belly , the passion for the work , to make it .
And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position , very important .
But equally important , it takes an understanding that it &apos;s hard work that makes the difference .
I don &apos;t care how smart you are or how smart you think you are .
Smart simply means you &apos;re ready to learn .
You &apos;re excited about learning and you want to ask good questions .
I. I. Rabi , a Nobel laureate , said that when he was growing up in New York , all of his friends &apos; parents would ask them &quot; What did you learn in school ? &quot; at the end of a day .
And he said , in contrast , his Jewish mother would say , &quot; Izzy , did you ask a good question today ? &quot;
And so high expectations have to do with curiosity and encouraging young people to be curious .
And as a result of those high expectations , we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them , not simply to survive in science and engineering , but to become the very best , to excel .
Interestingly enough , an example : One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; We need to have you retake the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot;
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
He retook the course .
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC , to become the first black to get the M.D. / Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania .
He now works at Harvard . Nice story . Give him a hand for that too .
Secondly , it &apos;s not about test scores only .
Test scores are important , but they &apos;re not the most important thing .
One young woman had great grades , but test scores were not as high .
But she had a factor that was very important .
She never missed a day of school , K-12 .
There was fire in that belly .
That young woman went on , and she is today with an M.D. / Ph.D. from Hopkins .
She &apos;s on the faculty , tenure track in psychiatry , Ph.D. in neuroscience .
She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients .
Big hand for her . Big hand for her .
And so high expectations , very important .
Secondly , the idea of building community among the students .
You all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat .
Students are not taught to work in groups .
And that &apos;s what we work to do with that group to get them to understand each other , to build trust among them , to support each other , to learn how to ask good questions , but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity .
As you know , it &apos;s one thing to earn an A yourself , it &apos;s another thing to help someone else do well .
And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world .
So building community among those students , very important .
Third , the idea of , it takes researchers to produce researchers .
Whether you &apos;re talking about artists producing artists or you &apos;re talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example -- you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
And so our students are working in labs regularly .
And one great example that you &apos;ll appreciate : During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago , the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days , and all these students had refused to leave the lab .
They had food they had packed out .
They were in the lab working , and they saw the work , not as schoolwork , but as their lives .
They knew they were working on AIDS research .
They were looking at this amazing protein design .
And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work .
And he said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t get any better than that . &quot;
And then finally , if you &apos;ve got the community and you &apos;ve got the high expectations and you &apos;ve got researchers producing researchers , you have to have people who are willing as faculty to get involved with those students , even in the classroom .
I &apos;ll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying , &quot; I &apos;ve got this young man in class , a young black guy , and he seems like he &apos;s just not excited about the work .
He &apos;s not taking notes . We need to talk to him . &quot;
What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and who was not and was saying , &quot; Let me see how I can work with them .
Let me get the staff to help me out . &quot;
It was that connecting .
That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D. / Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke .
Give him a big hand for that .
And so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us , not only finally with evaluation , assessing what works .
And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses .
And so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences .
Because so many students are bored in class .
Do you know that ?
Many students , K-12 and in universities , don &apos;t want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk .
They need to be engaged .
And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center , you &apos;ll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses , having an emphasis on collaboration , use of technology , using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus , and not giving students the theories , but having them struggle with those theories .
And it &apos;s working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland , more and more courses are being redesigned .
It &apos;s called academic innovation .
And what does all of that mean ?
It means that now , not just in science and engineering , we now have programs in the arts , in the humanities , in the social sciences , in teacher education , even particularly for women in I.T.
If you don &apos;t know it , there &apos;s been a 79-percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000 .
And what I &apos;m saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students , telling young women , young minority students and students in general , you can do this work .
And most important , giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work .
Most important , if a student has a sense of self , it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world .
When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham , I kept thinking , &quot; I wonder what my future could be . &quot;
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries , where students are not there just to survive , where they love learning , where they enjoy being the best , where they will one day change the world .
Aristotle said , &quot; Excellence is never an accident .
It is the result of high intention , sincere effort and intelligent execution .
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives . &quot;
And then he said something that gives me goosebumps .
He said , &quot; Choice , not chance , determines your destiny . &quot;
Choice , not chance , determines your destiny , dreams and values .
Thank you all very much .
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
They were blank on one side , and on the other side I listed some simple instructions .
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox , not just with postmarks from Washington , D.C. , but from Texas , California , Vancouver , New Zealand , Iraq .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
What I &apos;d like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
&quot; I found these stamps as a child , and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard .
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now .
&quot; Everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes I &apos;m dead . &quot;
&quot; I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes I didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot;
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you .
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
And sometimes afterwards I &apos;ll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
And I should also mention that , just like today , at that PostSecret event , I was using a wireless microphone .
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
This was really embarrassing when it happened , until I realized it could have been worse .
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
&quot; Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn &apos;t use .
I feel like the happiest person on Earth &quot; &quot; One of these men is the father of my son .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
&quot; That Saturday when you wondered where I was , well , I was getting your ring .
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine &apos;s Day .
It was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
And it hadn &apos;t been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
And he said , &quot; Frank , I &apos;ve got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
He said , &quot; For three years , my girlfriend and I , we &apos;ve made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
I read some to her , she reads some to me . &quot;
He says , &quot; It &apos;s really brought us closer together through the years .
And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom , I was beside myself .
And I tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
And just like every Sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . &quot;
He said , &quot; But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he said , &quot; She read it once and then she read it again . &quot;
And she turned to him and said , &quot; Is that our cat ? &quot;
And when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
He popped the question , she said yes . It was a very happy ending .
So I emailed him back and I said , &quot; Please share with me an image , something , that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . &quot;
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
I finally got the pictures developed and I &apos;d love to give them to you . &quot;
This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it , but this secret has impacted many lives , starting with a student up in Canada named Matty .
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called IFoundYourCamera .
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they &apos;ve found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
And it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people &apos;s lives can be huge .
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans , sometimes going through language barriers .
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today .
&quot; When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . &quot;
When I posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet again .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
It &apos;s somebody &apos;s birthday today Somebody &apos;s birthday today The candles are lighted on somebody &apos;s cake And we &apos;re all invited for somebody &apos;s sake You &apos;re 21 years old today .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because I was struggling with my own secrets .
And it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book ?
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
I &apos;d like to start tonight by something completely different , asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment .
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean , and it &apos;s where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it &apos;s where life began .
And it &apos;s a lively and a lovely place , but we &apos;re rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing , our irresponsible fishing , our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland , but also , most recently , with climate change , and Steve Schneider , I &apos;m sure , will be going into greater detail on this .
Now , as we continue to tinker with the oceans , more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we &apos;re creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals , like jellyfish and bacteria .
And this might be the kind of seas we &apos;re headed for .
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful , and you &apos;ll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday , but they sting like hell , and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up .
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories .
So it may be good for the waistline , but it probably won &apos;t keep you satiated for very long .
And a sea that &apos;s just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn &apos;t very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans , that is , unless you eat jellyfish .
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there , a by-the-wind sailor .
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish , the Mola mola , whose primary prey are jellyfish .
This animal is in &quot; The Guinness World Book of Records &quot; for being the world &apos;s heaviest bony fish .
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish , primarily .
And I think it &apos;s kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish -- that its favorite food is the moon jelly .
So it &apos;s kind of nice , the sun and the moon getting together this way , even if one is eating the other .
Now this is typically how you see sunfish , this is where they get their common name .
They like to sunbathe , can &apos;t blame them .
They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they &apos;re sick or lazy , but that &apos;s a typical behavior , they lie out and bask on the surface .
Their other name , Mola mola , is -- it sounds Hawaiian , but it &apos;s actually Latin for millstone , and that &apos;s attributable to their roundish , very bizarre , cut-off shape .
It &apos;s as if , as they were growing , they just forgot the tail part .
And that &apos;s actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place , was this terribly bizarre shape .
You know , you look at sharks , and they &apos;re streamlined , and they &apos;re sleek , and you look at tuna , and they &apos;re like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda . They &apos;re about migration and strength , and then you look at the sunfish .
And this is just so elegantly mysterious , it &apos;s just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say , a tuna .
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know , what is this animal &apos;s story ?
Well , as with anything in biology , nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution .
The Mola &apos;s no exception .
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared , 65 million years ago , at a time when whales still had legs , and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here .
Of course evolution is somewhat random , and you know , about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said , oh , the heck with the coral reefs -- we &apos;re going to head to the high seas .
And lots of generations , lots of tweaking and torquing , and we turn our puffer into the Mola .
You know , if you give Mother Nature enough time , that is what she will produce .
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished , abridged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .
They &apos;re -- every single thing about that fish has been changed .
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago , and they &apos;re pretty modern , just 50 million years ago , so -- so interestingly , they give away their ancestry as they develop .
They start as little eggs , and they &apos;re in &quot; The Guinness World Book of Records &quot; again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet .
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long . Imagine what a 10 foot one has .
And from that little egg , they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage , reminiscent of their ancestry , and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage .
They school as adolescents , and become behemoth loners as adults .
That &apos;s a little diver up there in the corner .
They &apos;re in &quot; The Guinness World Book of Records &quot; again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world .
From their little hatching size of their egg , into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood , they put on 600 million times an increase in weight .
600 million . Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby , and you had to feed this thing .
That would mean that your child , you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics .
Now I don &apos;t know how you &apos;d feed a child like that but -- we don &apos;t know how fast the Molas grow in the wild , but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months .
I said , now , that &apos;s a true American .
So being a loner is a great thing , especially in today &apos;s seas , because schooling used to be salvation for fishes , but it &apos;s suicide for fishes now .
But unfortunately Molas , even though they don &apos;t school , they still get caught in nets as by-catch .
If we &apos;re going to save the world from total jellyfish domination , then we &apos;ve got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives , like the Mola .
And unfortunately , they make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net .
And in the Mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
So we &apos;ve got to figure out how they &apos;re living their lives .
And how do you do that ?
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world .
This is an open ocean creature . It knows no boundaries -- it doesn &apos;t go to land .
How do you get insight ?
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets ?
Well , there &apos;s some great new technology that has just recently become available , and it &apos;s just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals .
And it &apos;s pictured right here , that little tag up there .
That little tag can record temperature , depth and light intensity , which is correlated with time , and from that we can get locations .
And it can record this data for up to two years , and keep it in that tag , release at a pre-programmed time , float to the surface , upload all that data , that whole travelogue , to satellite , which relays it directly to our computers , and we &apos;ve got that whole dataset . And we didn &apos;t even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know , sat at our desks .
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &apos;s streaming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
And it just so happens that &apos;s a parasite hanging off the Mola .
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites .
They &apos;re just parasite hotels ; even their parasites have parasites .
I think Donne wrote a poem about that .
But they have 40 genera of parasites , and so we figured just one more parasite won &apos;t be too much of a problem .
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment .
They don &apos;t seem to mind , so far .
So what are we trying to find out ? We &apos;re focusing on the Pacific .
We &apos;re tagging on the California coast , and we &apos;re tagging over in Taiwan and Japan .
And we &apos;re interested in how these animals are using the currents , using temperature , using the open ocean , to live their lives .
We &apos;d love to tag in Monterey .
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers .
Not this time of year -- it &apos;s more around October .
And we &apos;d love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately , the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way .
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay , rips off their fins , fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee , Mola style , and then tosses them back and forth .
And I &apos;m not exaggerating , it is just -- and sometimes they don &apos;t eat them , it &apos;s just spiteful .
And you know , the locals think it &apos;s terrible behavior , it &apos;s just horrible watching this happen , day after day .
The poor little Molas coming in , getting ripped to shreds , so we head down south , to San Diego .
Not so many California sea lions down there .
And the Molas there , you can find them with a spotter plane very easily , and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp .
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it &apos;s spa time for the Molas there .
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp , the exfoliating cleaner fish come .
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says , &quot; I &apos;m not threatening , but I need a massage . &quot;
And they &apos;ll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head , and the fish come up and they just clean , clean , clean -- because the Molas , you know , there &apos;s just a smorgasbord of parasites .
And it &apos;s also a great place to go down south because the water &apos;s warmer , and the Molas are kind of friendly down there .
I mean what other kind of fish , if you approach it right , will say , &quot; Okay , scratch me right there . &quot;
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they &apos;re very gentle -- and if you approach them right , you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it .
So we &apos;ve also tagged one part of the Pacific ; we &apos;ve gone over to another part of the Pacific , and we &apos;ve tagged in Taiwan , and we tagged in Japan .
And over in these places , the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries .
And they &apos;re not thrown back as by-catch , they &apos;re eaten .
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged .
Well , not the one we tagged !
And everything from the kidney , to the testes , to the back bone , to the fin muscle to -- I think that √≠s pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten .
So the hardest part of tagging , now , is after you put that tag on , you have to wait , months .
And you &apos;re just wondering , oh , I hope the fish is safe , I hope , I hope it &apos;s going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording .
The tags cost 3500 dollars each , and then satellite time is another 500 dollars , so you &apos;re like , oh , I hope the tag is okay .
And so the waiting is really the hardest part .
I &apos;m going to show you our latest dataset .
And it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally privy information just for TED .
And in showing you this , you know , when we &apos;re looking at this data , we &apos;re thinking , oh do these animals , do they cross the equator ?
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other ?
And we found that they kind of are homebodies .
They &apos;re not big migrators . This is their track : we deployed the tag off of Tokyo , and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there .
And after four months , went up , you know , off of the north part of Japan .
And that &apos;s kind of their home range .
Now that &apos;s important , though , because if there &apos;s a lot of fishing pressure , that population doesn &apos;t get replenished .
So that &apos;s a very important piece of data .
But also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not slacker , lazy fish .
They &apos;re super industrious .
And this is a day in the life of a Mola , and if we -- they &apos;re up and down , and up and down , and up and down , and up and up and down , up to 40 times a day .
As the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their dive .
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper , little deeper .
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters , in temperatures to one degree centigrade , and this is why you see them on the surface -- it &apos;s so cold down there .
They &apos;ve got to come up , warm , get that solar power , and then plunge back into the depths , and go up and down and up and down .
And they &apos;re hitting a layer down there ; it &apos;s called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food &apos;s in that layer .
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker , they &apos;re really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature .
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we &apos;re seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes , manta rays , tunas , a real three-dimensional play .
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life , where they &apos;re going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola &apos;s going to enter into that .
And what &apos;s exciting -- you all travel , and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals , and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge .
Well now with the Census of Marine Life , we &apos;ll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space , with local knowledge .
It &apos;s never -- it &apos;s really never been a more exciting , or a vital time , to be a biologist .
Which brings me to my last point , and what I think is kind of the most fun .
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish .
And so I just figured I &apos;d have the questions answered , and I &apos;d be able to thank my funders , like National Geographic and Lindbergh .
But people would write into the site with all sorts of , all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis .
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans .
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns , Jewish Rabbis , Muslims , Christians -- everybody writing in , united by their love of life .
And to me that -- I don &apos;t think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself : &quot; One touch of nature makes the whole world kin . &quot;
And sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it &apos;s helping .
If it &apos;s helping to unite the world , I think it &apos;s definitely the fish of the future .
You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initiation rites .
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
A language is a flash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot;
And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
They speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spirits .
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
We dance in the temple and become God . &quot;
And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot;
They call themselves the &quot; elder brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens .
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
Talk about getting by with nothing .
And this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
We think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
Our magazines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you very much .
I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
This is just not some blue sky thinking .
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
Obviously , this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries .
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue .
So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier .
With the HULC exoskeleton , I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours .
Its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high-agility movements .
It senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
So this is for real .
Now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passionate about .
There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
This is about one percent of the total population .
And that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
We are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
And the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
Thank you .
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set .
It has sensors .
It &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips , as well as her knee joints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait .
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me .
In a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis .
Not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
And that was 19 yeas ago .
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
Thank you .
As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
It &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
Thanks .
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
It &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
And no , this isn &apos;t Burning Man or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo .
Bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
That means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
Now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution .
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
While chimpanzees are dominated by big , scary guys , bonobo society is run by empowered females .
These guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet .
But unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
Not surprisingly , this destruction also endangers bonobo survival .
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
Yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees .
Who are these cousins ?
We know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; apes since they have frequent , promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
Now , I &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra .
Bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
Play is not just child &apos;s games .
For us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
Play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
And when you watch bonobo play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .
Play is the glue that binds us together .
Now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
First , it &apos;s a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football .
So here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
Have a look what she &apos;s doing .
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
Only I think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
Yeah .
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
But play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
Play &apos;s a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew .
And I want you to see , this is Fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
And it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present .
But they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
In other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
But will we make the most of our playfulness ?
Play is not frivolous .
Play &apos;s essential .
For bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
In times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
And so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
Thank you .
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
He retreated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
My mother , Mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
If we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
I don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
No apple has ever tasted the same .
After three months in a refugee camp , we landed in Melbourne .
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
We settled in Footscray , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence I was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray .
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
We were poor .
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
Two pairs of stockings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
A school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit-eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Something stiffened inside me .
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will bypass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I slept in the same bed .
My mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
Grants and sponsors were sought .
Centers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , I was the classic Asian student , relentless in the demands that I made on myself .
In the other , I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year .
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
Tan Le , anonymous Footscray resident , was now Tan Le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
No had never been an option .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised .
And the more candidly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not settle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province .
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
There was an energy there , an implacable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
So I followed my hunches .
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
For a year we were penniless .
At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My hunches again .
Three months later I had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
Before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne .
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
My mother phoned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket .
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the monk , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
Given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .
Defeat would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
Can I give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
And also , Tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve .
In other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves .
Something really weird is going on here .
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves ?
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
But when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
And there &apos;s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
Things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
One of two things is going to happen .
Either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
Now I &apos;m an optimist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
Because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
And those that were like that started to split and divide .
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
And every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
So those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
Somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
So in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
In fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
In fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder , which I try not to let the security people see at airports .
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I had really been a egotist , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
So what was the next step ?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were synergistic .
So they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
And those are the neural structures .
So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
So an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time scales .
But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
And for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
Here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
So for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
Telephony , computers , videotapes , CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
And you saw Ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes .
So now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
There are billions of them .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
Say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
But one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
And I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
Save those . Kill off the rest .
And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
And let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
Say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
Score them again .
Introduce some mutations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
They &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
But they do the job .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life depended on doing the job .
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
So it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confusing .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms .
So we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very haughty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get selected out .
