Last year when I was here , I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole .
And while that swim took place three years ago , I can remember it as if it was yesterday .
I remember standing on the edge of the ice , about to dive into the water , and thinking to myself , I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening .
The water is completely black .
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade , or 29 degrees Fahrenheit .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
And then a thought came across my mind : if things go pear-shaped on this swim , how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?
And then I said to myself , I &apos;ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following : I &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim Anyway , last year , I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier .
The glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .
And I firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the Himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas .
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , I think we have a real risk of instability .
North , you &apos;ve got China ; south , you &apos;ve India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , all these countries .
And so I decided to walk up to Mt . Everest , the highest mountain on this earth , and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt . Everest .
Now , I don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt . Everest , but it &apos;s quite an ordeal getting up there .
28 great , big , powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don &apos;t just have my Speedo , but there &apos;s a big film crew who then send all the images around the world .
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude .
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to breath . You get altitude sickness .
I feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt . Everest .
Many , many people have died on Mt . Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
And when you &apos;re walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier .
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt . Everest , and I prepared myself the same way as I &apos;ve always prepared myself , for this swim which was going to be so very difficult .
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music , I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water .
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters , and then I realized very , very quickly , I had a huge problem on my hands .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
And it all happened so quickly : I then -- I don &apos;t know how it happened -- but I went underwater .
And luckily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on .
I carried on for another five or six strokes , and then I had nothing in my body , and I went down to the bottom of the lake .
And I don &apos;t where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
I &apos;ve heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
My crew grabbed me , and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp .
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt . Everest .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
They said , Lewis , you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim .
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget .
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army , about speed and aggression , you put that to one side .
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days &apos; time , and instead of swimming fast , swim as slowly as possible .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
And I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
And I swam across the lake .
And I can &apos;t begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side .
But I learned two very , very important lessons there on Mt . Everest , and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
And similarly , now , before I do anything , I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task .
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frankly , the Mt . Everest of all problems -- just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
The warning signs are all there .
When I was born , the world &apos;s population was 3.5 billion people .
We &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
And I &apos;ve come here to ask you today : what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment , which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world , and most importantly , in a sustainable world ?
And I ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it .
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
So thank you very , very much .
The Kraken , a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales , and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island .
In assessing the merits of such tales , it &apos;s probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor &apos;s saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins , &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; and a sea story begins , &quot; This ain &apos;t no shit . &quot;
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale .
Nevertheless , there are giants in the ocean , and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware .
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan .
I &apos;m the short one .
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O &apos;Shea .
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED .
In 2010 , there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle &apos;s TED wish .
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .
Mike deGruy was also invited , and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean , and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he &apos;s been involved with for a very long time , which is the hunt for the giant squid .
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit , a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week .
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet , unobtrusive platforms for exploration .
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made , farting around in the dark using these platforms , and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles .
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view .
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems .
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make .
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean , and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made .
The Johnson Sea-Link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here , uses electric thrusters -- very , very quiet .
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters .
It &apos;s also pretty quiet , but a bit noisier .
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana .
I think that &apos;s got to be scaring a lot of animals away .
So for the deep sea squid hunt , I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters , no motors , just a battery-powered camera , and the only illumination coming from red light that &apos;s invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue .
That &apos;s visible to our eye , but it &apos;s the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea .
So this camera platform , which we called the Medusa , could just be thrown off the back of the ship , attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line , it would just float around passively carried by the currents , and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure , which we called the electronic jellyfish , or e-jelly , because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla .
Now , this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense .
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it &apos;s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it &apos;s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
It &apos;s a scream for help , a last-ditch attempt for escape , and a common form of defense in the deep sea .
The approach worked .
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant , we managed six , and the first triggered wild excitement .
Edith Widder : Oh my God . Oh my God ! Are you kidding me ? Other scientists : Oh ho ho ! That &apos;s just hanging there .
EW : It was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
Scientists : Ooh . Bang ! Oh my God ! Whoa !
EW : The full monty .
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it , which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly .
But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible .
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used , a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it , a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use , and I think it was this light that brought the giant in .
Now , what you &apos;re seeing is the intensified camera &apos;s view under red light , and that &apos;s all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here .
And then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn &apos;t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video .
It was absolutely breathtaking , and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended , it would have been as tall as a two-story house .
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now ?
We &apos;ve only explored about five percent of our ocean .
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we &apos;ve spent on space exploration .
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth .
We need — thank you .
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation .
Innovation drives economic growth .
So let &apos;s all go exploring , but let &apos;s do it in a way that doesn &apos;t scare the animals away , or , as Mike deGruy once said , &quot; If you want to get away from it all and see something you &apos;ve never seen , or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one &apos;s ever seen , get in a sub . &quot;
He should have been with us for this adventure .
We miss him .
As an architect , I often ask myself , what is the origin of the forms that we design ?
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn &apos;t work with references anymore ?
If we had no bias , if we had no preconceptions , what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience ?
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they surprise us ? Would they intrigue us ?
Would they delight us ?
If so , then how can we go about creating something that is truly new ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
And I &apos;m not saying that we should copy nature , I &apos;m not saying we should mimic biology , instead I propose that we can borrow nature &apos;s processes .
We can abstract them and to create something that is new .
Nature &apos;s main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells .
And these cells can either be identical , or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division .
If we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
Through this very simple process , we can create an astounding variety of forms .
Now , we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures , but rather than folding things by hand , we &apos;ll bring the structure into the computer , and code it as an algorithm .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
We can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
And as we &apos;re seeking to make something three-dimensional , we start not with a single surface , but with a volume .
A simple volume , the cube .
If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again , then after 16 iterations , 16 steps , we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks , for instance , like this .
And if we change where we make the folds , if we change the folding ratio , then this cube turns into this one .
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape , or this shape .
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we &apos;re making the fold , but essentially you &apos;re looking at a folded cube .
And we can play with this .
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
And because we &apos;re doing the folding on the computer , we are completely free of any physical constraints .
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become impossibly small .
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
In general , if we make a small change to the folding ratio , which is what you &apos;re seeing here , then the form changes correspondingly .
But that &apos;s only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error .
A far more effective way to create forms , I have found , is to use information that is already contained in forms .
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye .
So , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges .
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
So now I &apos;m not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead I &apos;m establishing a rule , I &apos;m establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded .
And because I &apos;ve designed the process and not the form , I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms .
These forms look elaborate , but the process is a very minimal one .
There is a simple input , it &apos;s always a cube that I start with , and it &apos;s a very simple operation -- it &apos;s making a fold , and doing this over and over again .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
They &apos;ve been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty , about technology .
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column .
I started using four cylinders .
Through a lot of experimentation , these cylinders eventually evolved into this .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
And unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
These forms are undrawable .
An architect who &apos;s drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months , or it would take even a year to draw all the sections , all of the elevations , you can only create something like this through an algorithm .
The more interesting question , perhaps , is , are these forms imaginable ?
Usually , an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
There &apos;s no randomness involved at all , but it &apos;s not entirely predictable .
There &apos;s too many surfaces , there &apos;s too much detail , one can &apos;t see the end state .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there .
For one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them .
And to go back to the analogy with nature , one can begin to think in terms of populations , one can talk about permutations , about generations , about crossing and breeding to come up with a design .
And the architect is really , he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes .
But enough of the theory .
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image , so to say , I bought these red and blue 3D glasses , got up very close to the screen , but still that wasn &apos;t the same as being able to walk around and touch things .
So there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
For me , or for my purpose at this moment , there &apos;s still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other .
So instead , we decided to take the column , and we decided to build it as a layered model , made out of very many slices , thinly stacked over each other .
What you &apos;re looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw , viewed from the top .
Unbeknownst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the column , which was quite a surprising discovery .
From this shape , we calculated a cutting line , and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you &apos;re seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices , individually cut , on top of each other .
And this is a photo now , it &apos;s not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
Almost all of the details , almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved .
But it was very labor intensive .
There &apos;s a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical .
It took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
The physical model , on the other hand , is 2,700 layers , one millimeter thick , it weighs 700 kilos , it &apos;s made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium .
And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again .
But it is increasingly possible .
Machines are getting faster , it &apos;s getting less expensive , and there &apos;s some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
And in this case , I used ABS plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they &apos;re structural , they can bear loads for once .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
You can see a different column in the mirror , if there &apos;s a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion .
So where does this leave us ?
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object , but a process to generate objects .
I &apos;ve shown one simple process that was inspired by nature ; there &apos;s countless other ones .
In short , we have no constraints .
Instead , we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn &apos;t even have dreamt up .
And , if I may add , at one point we will build them .
Thank you .
I essentially drag sledges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually , but I &apos;m going to read this question from an interview earlier this year : &quot; Philosophically , does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving ?
After all , if it is being done somewhere by someone , and we can participate virtually , then why bother leaving the house ? &quot;
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles , but I &apos;ve spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle , so I get out of the house a fair bit .
And in my nature , I guess , I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things , and it &apos;s that dichotomy , the gulf between ideas and action that I &apos;m going to try and explore briefly .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
that &apos;s been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap , the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back , second from the left , George Lee Mallory . Many of you will know his name .
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt . Everest .
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest , more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary .
No one knows if he got to the top . It &apos;s still a mystery .
But he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; Because it &apos;s there . &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There &apos;s very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , I &apos;ve printed this . I &apos;m going to read it out .
&quot; The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this : What is the use of climbing Mt . Everest ?
And my answer must at once be , it is no use .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
Oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it .
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . So it is no use .
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it , that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward , then you won &apos;t see why we go .
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
That is what life means , and that is what life is for . &quot;
Mallory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t tally that neatly with my own experience .
The furthest I &apos;ve ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004 . I still don &apos;t know exactly what came over me , but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean .
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole , and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada .
No one had ever done this . I was 26 at the time .
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the Arctic Ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreciate the sense of apprehension , as I sat in a helicopter thundering north , and the sense , I think if anything , of impending doom .
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
I was 26 . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge . I had my skis ready to go , I had a satellite phone , a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear .
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter .
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger . Part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly I was just utterly terrified .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
I didn &apos;t see anyone else . We took this photo next to the helicopter .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so I &apos;m traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies , about 400 pounds . The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35 . Minus 50 was the coldest .
So again , there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
One of the magical things about this journey , however , is that because I &apos;m walking over the sea , over this floating , drifting , shifting crust of ice that &apos;s floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s in a constant state of flux .
The ice is always moving , breaking up , drifting around , refreezing , so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me . No one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the views , the vistas , that I saw for 10 weeks .
And that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
I can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely , I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and I &apos;m unable to do it justice .
And it seems to me , therefore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to engage , to endeavor , rather than to watch and to wonder , that &apos;s where the real meat of life is to be found , the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
In my experience , there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what &apos;s humanly possible .
Now I don &apos;t just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do , but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer , there is something addictive about this , and in my case , I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit .
I can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship I &apos;ve ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and I wonder if that &apos;s the case whether there &apos;s something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that &apos;s certainly the case .
There is one unfinished challenge that &apos;s been calling out to me for most of my adult life .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole .
No one knew what was there . It was utterly unmapped at the time . We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica .
Scott , as many of you will know , was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team , who used dogs and dogsleds . Scott &apos;s team were on foot , all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges , and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there , I &apos;d imagine pretty bitter and demoralized .
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure .
When I talk about Antarctica , people often say , &quot; Hasn &apos;t , you know , that &apos;s interesting , hasn &apos;t that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike ? &quot;
Or , &quot; That &apos;s nice . You know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cruise to Antarctica next year . You know .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again .
It is , arguably , the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
This time next year , in October , I &apos;m leading a team of three .
It will take us about four months to make this return journey .
That &apos;s the scale . The red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
We have to turn around and come back again .
I &apos;m well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . You &apos;ll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
And it &apos;ll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been . There certainly isn &apos;t much call for explorers nowadays . My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option .
If I wanted to know , for example , how many stars were in the Milky Way , how old those giant heads on Easter Island were , most of you could find that out right now without even standing up .
And yet , if I &apos;ve learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what &apos;s comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
In life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and I think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage .
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what &apos;s outside .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know what the hell I &apos;m doing here .
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada , and dropped out of high school . I don &apos;t own a cell phone , and I paint on paper using gouache , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York , and I titled it &quot; Serious Nonsense . &quot;
So I think I &apos;m actually the first one here -- I lead .
I called it &quot; Serious Nonsense &quot; because on the serious side , I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid . I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it &apos;s the only style I know . And it &apos;s very kind of staid and formal .
And meanwhile , I use nonsense , as you can see .
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you can &apos;t see there .
This was one of a series called &quot; Zany Afternoons , &quot; which became a book .
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car . That &apos;s a 1953 Henry J -- I &apos;m a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo .
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film .
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town .
My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it .
And I work a lot in what I call &quot; retrofuturism , &quot; which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow .
And they &apos;re always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong .
And the peak time for that was the 30s , because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
and technology was going to carry us along .
This is Popular Workbench . Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it &apos;s all going to happen , it &apos;s all going to be wonderful .
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties .
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter , so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject .
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half .
This is the &apos; 58 Bulgemobile : so new , they make tomorrow look like yesterday .
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car .
That &apos;s from a whole catalog -- it &apos;s 18 pages or so -- ran back in the days of the Lampoon , where I cut my teeth .
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason , usually .
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the Hindenburg .
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark , and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it .
So the Hindenburg wasn &apos;t , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s .
The auto-gyro couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the helicopter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
It &apos;s the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
You needed to know that .
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream .
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car .
This is pitched into the future from 1946 , looking at the day all American families have them .
&quot; There &apos;s Moscow , Shirley . Hope they speak Esperanto ! &quot;
Faux-nostalgia , which I &apos;m sort of -- not , say , famous for , but I work an awful lot in it .
It &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so I think that &apos;s a case for serious play .
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . You can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away .
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons .
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . I do a lot of that .
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense .
I think it adds a huge amount .
Those , for example , are Mark IV British tanks from 1916 .
They had two machine guns and a cannon , and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines .
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark .
And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren &apos;t going to use gas .
Happy little story , isn &apos;t it ?
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s , where you drove up to your front door , if you had the guts .
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm .
And I love cigars -- there &apos;s a cigar billboard down there .
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war .
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940 , when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around , just to piss off Churchill , who &apos;s down there somewhere .
It &apos;s a fond memory of times past .
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit , just for the fun of it . This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- &quot; RMS Tyrannic : The Biggest Thing in All the World . &quot;
The copy , which you can &apos;t see because it goes on and on for several pages , says that steerage passengers can &apos;t get their to bunks before the voyage is over , and it &apos;s so safe it carries no insurance .
It &apos;s obviously modeled on the Titanic .
But it &apos;s not a cri de coeur about man &apos;s hubris in the face of the elements .
It &apos;s just a sick , silly joke .
Shamelessly cheap is something , I think -- this will wake you up .
It has no meaning , just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi , and it &apos;s a Desoto discovering the Mississippi .
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon , and I did that , and I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m ashamed . I hope nobody knows it . &quot;
People wrote in for reprints of that thing .
Urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the New Yorker really calls for .
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers .
I &apos;ve done about 40 of them , and I &apos;d say 30 of them are based on that concept .
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m. , and this steam pouring out of the street , and I thought , &quot; What causes that ? &quot; And that -- who &apos;s to say ?
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it &apos;s a very somber place .
I thought I could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
This is a very un-PC cover . Not in New York .
I couldn &apos;t resist , and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying , &quot; This is too serious and solemn to make fun of . You should be ashamed , please apologize on our website . &quot;
Haven &apos;t got around to it yet but -- I may .
This is the word side of my brain .
I love the word &quot; Eurotrash . &quot;
That &apos;s all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs .
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France .
If you live in New York , you know how the bike messengers move .
Except that he &apos;s carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times , I guess .
This is the only fashion cover I &apos;ve ever done .
It &apos;s the little old lady that lives in a shoe , and then this thing -- the title of that was , &quot; There Goes the Neighborhood . &quot;
I don &apos;t know a hell of a lot about fashion -- I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane , and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying : &quot; Put a strap on it &quot; -- &quot; No , don &apos;t put a strap on it &quot; -- &quot; Put a strap on it -- &quot; Don &apos;t put a strap on it &quot; -- because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it &apos;s bad and -- I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe .
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass . One letter makes an idea .
This is a big joke .
This is the audition for &quot; King Kong . &quot;
People always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ?
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover , in the middle of the night , this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down .
It was perfectly clear . I didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
And then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
Her former name was Fay Wray , and so that was -- I didn &apos;t have the wit to say , &quot; Take the painting . &quot;
Finally , this was a three-page cover , never done before , and I don &apos;t think it will ever be done again -- successive pages in the front of the magazine .
It &apos;s the ascent of man using an escalator , and it &apos;s in three parts .
You can &apos;t see it all together , unfortunately , but if you look at it enough , you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move .
Pretty elegant . Nothing like a crash to end a joke . That completes my oeuvre .
I would just like to add a crass commercial -- I have a kids &apos; book coming out in the fall called &quot; Marvel Sandwiches , &quot; a compendium of all the serious play that ever was , and it &apos;s going to be available in fine bookstores , crummy bookstores , tables on the street in October .
So thank you very much .
Of the five senses , vision is the one that I appreciate the most , and it &apos;s the one that I can least take for granted .
I think this is partially due to my father , who was blind .
It was a fact that he didn &apos;t make much of a fuss about , usually .
One time in Nova Scotia , when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun -- yeah , same one as in the Carly Simon song , which may or may not refer to James Taylor , Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger ; we &apos;re not really sure .
They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes .
But Dad got really scared : he didn &apos;t want us doing that .
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged .
I thought this was a little strange at the time .
What I didn &apos;t know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight .
When he and his sister Martha were just very little , their mom took them out to see a total eclipse -- or actually , a solar eclipse -- and not long after that , both of them started losing their eyesight .
Decades later , it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection .
As near as we can tell , it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse , but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault .
So , Dad graduated Harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in Lexington , Massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until Concord .
He got a job working for Raytheon , designing guidance systems , which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days -- so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the &apos; 70s .
Dad wasn &apos;t a real militaristic kind of guy ; he just really felt bad that he wasn &apos;t able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap , although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test , which was for vision .
So , Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius , rocket scientist , inventor .
But to us he was just Dad , and our home life was pretty normal .
As a kid , I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics .
I played a lot of chess .
But at the age of 14 , a friend of mine got me interested in comic books , and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living .
So , here &apos;s my dad : he &apos;s a scientist , he &apos;s an engineer and he &apos;s a military contractor .
So , he has four kids , right ?
One grows up to become a computer scientist , one grows up to join the Navy , one grows up to become an engineer , and then there &apos;s me : the comic book artist .
Which , incidentally , makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen , because I &apos;m a comic book artist , son of an inventor , and he &apos;s an inventor , son of a comic book artist .
Right , it &apos;s true .
The funny thing is , Dad had a lot of faith in me .
He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist , even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever : everything he saw was just a blur .
Now , this gives a real meaning to the term &quot; blind faith , &quot; which doesn &apos;t have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people .
Now , faith in things which cannot be seen , which cannot be proved , is not the sort of faith that I &apos;ve ever really related to all that much .
I tend to like science , where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know .
But there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage , and his steam-driven computers that were never built .
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind , except for Ada Lovelace , and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream .
Vannevar Bush with his Memex -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips -- he had this vision .
And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook .
And , yeah , we can look back in retrospect and say , yeah , ha-ha , you know -- it &apos;s all microfilm . But that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . He understood the shape of the future .
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction .
Same thing : he understood the shape of the future , even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later .
Or Paul Baran , and his vision for packet switching .
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day .
Or even the people who actually pulled it off , the people at Bolt , Beranek and Newman in Boston , who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network , and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson &apos;s -- on Route 128 in Lexington , Massachusetts , just two miles from where I was studying the Queen &apos;s Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; amp ; the Pips singing &quot; Midnight Train to Georgia , &quot; while -- -- in my dad &apos;s big easy chair , you know ?
So , three types of vision , right ?
Vision based on what one cannot see : the vision of that unseen and unknowable .
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained .
And this third kind of vision , of something which can be , which may be , based on knowledge , but is as yet unproven .
Now , we &apos;ve seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science , but I think it &apos;s also true in the arts , it &apos;s true in politics , it &apos;s even true in personal endeavors .
What it comes down to , really , is four basic principles : learn from everyone , follow no one , watch for patterns , and work like hell .
I think these are the four principles that go into this .
And it &apos;s that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
What &apos;s interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world , is , I think , only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor .
In comics , I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works .
Then there &apos;s another , more classical , attitude which embraces beauty and craft .
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .
And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience -- and honesty , and rawness .
These are four very different ways of looking at the world . I even gave them names .
The classicist , the animist , and formalist and iconoclast .
Interestingly , it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung &apos;s four subdivisions of human thought .
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right ; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom .
And if you go on the diagonal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art , which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all , or for that matter , nothing to do with our conference theme of &quot; Inspired by Nature &quot; -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him , but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die , but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says , &quot; Because it &apos;s my nature &quot; -- in that sense , yes .
So -- so this was my nature . The thing was , I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was , I saw it as just this road to discovery .
Actually , it was just me embracing my nature , which means that I didn &apos;t actually fall that far from the tree after all .
So what does a &quot; scientific mind &quot; do in the arts ?
Well , I started making comics , but I also started trying to understand them , almost immediately .
And one of the most important things about comics , I discovered , was that comics are a visual medium , but they try to embrace all of the senses within it .
So , the different elements of comics , like pictures and words , and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision .
So you have things like resemblance , where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions : abstracted from resemblance , but still retaining the complete meaning , or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan .
Put all these three together , and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace .
And if you move to the right you also get language , because that &apos;s abstracting even further from resemblance , but still maintaining meaning .
Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage , as well .
Also , to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals .
And there &apos;s also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics .
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels , and then gives you something to imagine between the panels .
Also , another sense which comics &apos; vision represents , and that &apos;s time .
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics .
Comics presents a kind of temporal map .
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics , but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms , and I found some in history .
And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea .
What &apos;s happening is , the art form is colliding with the given technology , whether it &apos;s paint on stone , like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt , or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column , or a 200-foot-long embroidery , or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages .
What &apos;s interesting is , once you hit print -- and this is from 1450 , by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves : rectilinear panel arrangements , simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence .
And within 100 years , you already start to see word balloons and captions , and it &apos;s really just a hop , skip and a jump from here to here .
So I wrote a book about this in &apos; 93 , but as I was finishing the book , I had to do a little bit of typesetting , and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it , so I bought a computer .
And it was just a little thing -- it wasn &apos;t good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore &apos;s Law , about Moore &apos;s Law back in the &apos; 70s , and I knew what was coming .
And so , I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre-print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond , to post-print comics .
So , one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound , motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days .
This was even before the Web .
And one of the first things they did was , they tried to take the comics page as-is and transplant it to monitors , which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology .
And so , what they would do is , they &apos;d have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages , and they would introduce all this sound and motion .
The problem was , that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion , which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time , then they break with that continuity of presentation .
Interactivity was another thing .
There were hypertext comics .
But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here , not here or connected to here ; it &apos;s profoundly non-spatial .
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny , the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to &quot; Plan 9 &quot; to nine lives : it &apos;s all the same .
And -- but in comics , in comics , every aspect of the work , every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times .
So the question was : was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us ?
And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you .
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line , whether it &apos;s going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right , or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages .
The same thing is happening , and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise , but there were compromises when print hit .
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments , so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again .
And I thought , O.K. , well , if that &apos;s true , is there any way , when we go beyond today &apos;s print , to somehow bring that back ?
Now , the monitor is just as limited as the page , technically , right ?
It &apos;s a different shape , but other than that it &apos;s the same basic limitation .
But that &apos;s only if you look at the monitor as a page , but not if you look at the monitor as a window .
And that &apos;s what I proposed : that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas : along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases .
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular .
We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn .
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel .
X , Y and also Z.
So I had all these notions . This was back in the late &apos; 90s , and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy , but a lot of people then went on and actually did it .
I &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex .
And notice what &apos;s going on here .
What I &apos;m searching for is a durable mutation -- that &apos;s what all of us are searching for .
As media head into this new era , we are looking for mutations that are durable , that have some sort of staying power .
Now , we &apos;re taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium , and then we &apos;re carrying it through all the way from beginning to end .
That &apos;s that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now .
But even though we &apos;re only experiencing it one piece at a time , that &apos;s just where the technology is right now .
As the technology evolves , as you get full immersive displays and whatnot , this sort of thing will only grow .
It will adapt . It will adapt to its environment : it &apos;s a durable mutation .
Here &apos;s another one I &apos;ll show you . This is by Drew Weing ; this is called , &quot; Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe . &quot;
See what &apos;s going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you &apos;re creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about .
We &apos;ll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea .
I just want to get to the last panel .
There we go .
Just one more .
Talk about your infinite canvas .
It &apos;s by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain .
Why is this important ?
I think this is important because media , all media , provide us a window back into our world .
Now , it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually , virtual reality , or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display , is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we &apos;re in .
That &apos;s why most people turn to storytelling , is to escape .
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in .
And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique .
Because what you &apos;re looking at is , you &apos;re looking at comics cubed : you &apos;re looking at comics that are more comics-like than they &apos;ve ever been before .
When that happens , you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows , and when you do that , it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape .
And that &apos;s why I think this is important .
One of many reasons , but I &apos;ve got to go now .
Thank you for having me .
Phyllis Rodriguez : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001 .
We didn &apos;t know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband , Orlando , and I and our family .
And when I saw it -- and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful .
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that , publicly .
Through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims &apos; families .
When I saw Aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and I thought , &quot; What a brave woman .
Someday I want to meet that woman when I &apos;m stronger . &quot;
I was still in deep grief ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the strength .
I knew I would find her someday , or we would find each other .
Because , when people heard that my son was a victim , I got immediate sympathy .
But when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn &apos;t get that sympathy .
But her suffering is equal to mine .
So we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
And I still suffer , because my son is like he &apos;s buried alive .
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
My son , I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tortured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women .
For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change .
It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
I go to schools to talk to young , Muslim girls so they don &apos;t accept to be married against their will very young .
So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good .
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
PR : I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security , because it was November 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Before we knew each others &apos; names , or anything , we had embraced and wept .
Then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
And Aicha started , and she said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families .
I know what it is to suffer , and I feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot;
But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker .
And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings .
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we &apos;d felt as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had .
I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much .
And I think it &apos;s all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , &quot; Hey , this wasn &apos;t so hard .
Who else can I meet that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot;
So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?
Because our time is up .
AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
You have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
And I hope that someday we &apos;ll all live together in peace and respecting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
However , largely to our surprise , they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state .
It turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we &apos;ve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies , mostly U.S. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world .
We &apos;ve heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6 .
Edward Snowden started leaking information , top secret classified information , from the U.S. intelligence agencies , and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others .
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell , well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist .
We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
Due to be opened very soon , it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center .
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
How big ? Well , I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
You think about the largest IKEA store you &apos;ve ever been in .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever , keep it for extended periods of time , keep it for years , keep it for decades .
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
Well , not exactly everyone , because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners &apos; data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States .
And monitoring foreigners doesn &apos;t sound too bad until you realize that I &apos;m a foreigner and you &apos;re a foreigner .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us , all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet .
But don &apos;t get me wrong : There are actually types of surveillance that are okay .
I love freedom , but even I agree that some surveillance is fine .
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting , and they have leads and they have suspects , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect &apos;s phone , and to intercept his Internet communications .
I &apos;m not arguing that at all , but that &apos;s not what programs like PRISM are about .
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings .
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this , well , the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations , there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations , saying that we knew all this already , we knew it was happening , there &apos;s nothing new here .
And that &apos;s not true . Don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
Our worst fears might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about this . We didn &apos;t know about PRISM .
We didn &apos;t know about XKeyscore . We didn &apos;t know about Cybertrans .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies .
But now we do .
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
And what that means is that you take something which is secure , an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file , nobody can decrypt that file .
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file , it &apos;s going to take millions of years .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result .
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
This is what they have been told to do : do signals intelligence , monitor telecommunications , monitor Internet traffic .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the encryption .
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose .
They are completely out of control , and they should be brought back under control .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers , and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to .
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
So for example , they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11 , 2007 , for Yahoo on the March 12 , 2008 , and then others : Google , Facebook , Skype , Apple and so on .
And every single one of these companies denies .
They all say that this simply isn &apos;t true , that they are not giving backdoor access to their data .
Yet we have these files .
So is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
And one explanation would be that these parties , these service providers , are not cooperating .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
That would explain it . They aren &apos;t cooperating . They &apos;ve been hacked .
In this case , they &apos;ve been hacked by their own government .
That might sound outlandish , but we already have cases where this has happened , for example , the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government , and which , to spread , subverted the security of the Windows Update network , meaning here , the company was hacked by their own government .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
Der Spiegel , from Germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
Inside NSA , the unit is called TAO , Tailored Access Operations , and inside GCHQ , which is the U.K. equivalent , it &apos;s called NAC , Network Analysis Centre .
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium .
And what this really means is that an E.U. country &apos;s intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose , and they discuss it in their slides completely casually , business as usual .
Here &apos;s the primary target , here &apos;s the secondary target , here &apos;s the teaming .
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub .
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like , you know , &quot; Success , &quot; when they gain access to services like this .
What the hell ?
And then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well .
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Many countries spy , not all of them , but let &apos;s take an example .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
I &apos;m speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States .
When your data traffic goes through Sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic .
All right , how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , U.S.-based services , like , you know , run Windows or OSX , or use Facebook or LinkedIn , or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox , or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support ?
And the answer is , every single Swedish business leader does that every single day .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
And when we do have the occasional European success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the United States .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
So once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome .
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
Yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders , to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil , to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament , and I don &apos;t think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament , right ?
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ?
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat , we are ready to do anything at all ?
But people are scared about terrorists , and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
Because we have this thing called privacy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
But people are brutally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Yet , I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency , especially a foreign intelligence agency .
And if we indeed need a Big Brother , I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother .
And when the leaks started , the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you &apos;ve been using search engines , you &apos;ve been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence .
And two minutes later , I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me , like , why am I worried about this ?
What am I sending to worry about this ? Am I sending naked pictures or something ?
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either .
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
You show me your search history , and I &apos;ll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes .
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you .
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the United States .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today .
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil , Ms. Dilma Rousseff .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
Her email was read , and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters , and she said , &quot; If there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Marcus Ranum , he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies .
So we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the Internet , we should think about Americans as our masters .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
We should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
What &apos;s going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
A single country , any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services .
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
By building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
It only has to solve one little problem .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Haroon Meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state .
Thank you very much .
So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
And it &apos;s not a trip that requires light-years of travel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defined by light .
So it &apos;s a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , I &apos;ve been a bioluminescence junky .
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover .
This next video clip , you &apos;re going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence .
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
In front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact With the sub &apos;s lights switched off , it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Edith Widder : So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
But just to try to prove that fact to you , I &apos;ve brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration .
So , if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible , I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it .
And you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
Oops . Sorry .
I spend most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
Okay .
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga .
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it &apos;s meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
There &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s got a lot of other light organs you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minute .
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible .
But it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights .
It &apos;s a scream for help ; it &apos;s meant to attract attention .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
And you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
For example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
This little squid is called the fire shooter Now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
So there &apos;s a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light .
And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why .
They use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really strange .
And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; Avatar , &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to Pandora to see them .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed .
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
So if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that &apos;s just breathtaking .
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
And these are flytrap anemones .
Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
But if you keep poking it , it starts to produce light .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
It produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense .
There are starfish that can make light .
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
This looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
But if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
And like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light .
So if I squeeze the base , the bands go from base to tip .
If I squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
I &apos;d be very interested in your theories about what that &apos;s about .
So there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays .
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
It &apos;s just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays .
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s unobtrusive .
So I just want to show you some of the responses we &apos;ve elicited from animals in the deep sea .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
And when it starts flashing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the LEDs that &apos;s flashing very fast .
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
It looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
We basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
And I think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
And then finally , I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year .
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
This is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria .
And it is an optical cue that there &apos;s carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
So this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark .
And I can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there &apos;s bait right there .
But if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
Okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it &apos;s going to be this pinwheel display .
And this is a burglar alarm .
And that was a Humboldt squid , a juvenile Humboldt squid , about three feet long .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
But if it &apos;s a burglar alarm , you wouldn &apos;t expect it to attack the jellyfish directly .
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , &quot; Maybe if I come in from a different angle . &quot;
Nope .
So we are starting to get a handle on this , but only just the beginnings .
We need more eyes on the process .
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible , by all means , climb in and take the plunge .
This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
More than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
It &apos;s a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don &apos;t have to travel to another planet to see .
But if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
You guys were amazing .
That &apos;s amazing .
You just don &apos;t hear that every day .
Usman , the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube .
Usman Riaz : Yes , that was the first one . And then I -- That was the first thing I learned , and then I started progressing to other things .
And I started watching Kaki King a lot , and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence , so then I started watching his videos , and it &apos;s very surreal right now to be -- Was that piece just now , that was one of his songs that you learned , or how did that happen ?
UR : I &apos;d never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so I was familiar with it , so that &apos;s why I had so much more fun learning it .
And it finally happened , so ...
Preston , from your point of view , I mean , you invented this like 20 years ago , right ?
How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
Preston Reed : It &apos;s mind-blowing , and I feel really proud , really honored .
And he &apos;s a wonderful musician , so it &apos;s cool .
I guess , I don &apos;t think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do ?
Can you ? Do you jam ? Do you have anything else ?
PR : We haven &apos;t prepared anything .
There isn &apos;t . I &apos;ll tell you what .
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and we just see that , I just think -- I can feel it . We want to hear a little more .
And if it goes horribly wrong , no worries .
What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I &apos;m going to describe to you .
The first thing I &apos;m going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly .
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems , they simply will not work .
That &apos;s the first thing .
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal , if we study this mammal , we &apos;re going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses , such as blindness and deafness .
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA .
So are you all thinking ?
So , magnificent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
Who here thought of a bat ?
Ah , I can see half the audience agrees with me , and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you .
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals .
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat , and they have very unique attributes .
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years .
One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly .
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing .
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times : once in the bats , once in the birds , and once in the pterodactyls .
And so with flight , it &apos;s very metabolically costly .
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this .
But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . They use echolocation .
Now , what I mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose . This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment , and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image .
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness .
Indeed , they do look very strange . We &apos;re humans .
We &apos;re a visual species . When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we didn &apos;t believe it .
For a hundred years , despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing , we didn &apos;t believe it .
Now , if you look at this bat , it looks a little bit alien .
Indeed , the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said , &quot; To truly experience an alien life form on this planet , you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying , echolocating bat in complete darkness . &quot;
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat , you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it .
Very big ears , strange nose leaves , but teeny-tiny eyes .
So again , if you just look at this bat , you realize sound is very important for its survival .
Most bats look like the previous one .
However , there are a group that do not use echolocation .
They do not perceive their environment using sound , and these are the flying foxes .
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia , you &apos;ve seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney , and if you just look at their face , you can see they have much , much larger eyes and much smaller ears .
So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception .
Now this is going to be important for what I &apos;m going to tell you later during the talk .
Now , if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you , and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats , that &apos;s probably not that surprising , because here in Western culture , bats have been demonized .
Really , of course the famous book &quot; Dracula , &quot; written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker , probably is mainly responsible for this .
However , I also think it &apos;s got to do with the fact that bats come out at night , and we don &apos;t really understand them . We &apos;re a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us .
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events .
They are the perpetrators in horror movies , such as this famous &quot; Nightwing . &quot;
Also , if you think about it , demons always have bat wings , whereas birds , they typically -- or angels have bird wings .
Now , this is Western society , and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture , that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck , and indeed , if you walk into a Chinese home , you may see an image such as this .
This is considered the Five Blessings .
The Chinese word for &quot; bat &quot; sounds like the Chinese word for &quot; happiness , &quot; and they believe that bats bring wealth , health , longevity , virtue and serenity .
And indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats .
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat , and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings .
So , wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth ?
Now as I said before , bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly . And why is this ?
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants .
They also feed on fruit , and they disperse the seeds of these fruits . Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant , and this is a multi-million dollar industry in Mexico . So indeed , we need them for our ecosystems to function properly .
Without them , it &apos;s going to be a problem .
But most bats are voracious insect predators .
It &apos;s been estimated in the U.S. , in a tiny colony of big brown bats , that they will feed on over a million insects a year , and in the United States of America , right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome .
It &apos;s working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats , and scientists have estimated that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats .
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
by their attraction to wind farms . Again , right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem .
They &apos;re going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone .
Now how can this help us ?
Well , it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation , we &apos;re going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops .
And for one year in the U.S. alone , it &apos;s estimated that it &apos;s going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars , if we remove bats . So indeed , bats then do bring us wealth .
They maintain the health of our ecosystems , and also they save us money .
So again , that &apos;s the first blessing . Bats are important for our ecosystems .
And what about the second ? What about health ?
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome .
Your genome is made up of your DNA , your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are .
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies , it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very , very reduced cost .
Now when we &apos;ve been doing this , we &apos;ve realized that there &apos;s variations within our genome .
So I want you to look at the person beside you .
Just have a quick look . And what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA , you &apos;re a little bit different .
And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
Again , what does it mean here ? What does this variation actually mean ? So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years , we have to be able to differentiate between the two . So how do we do this ?
Well , I believe we just look at nature &apos;s experiments .
So through natural selection , over time , mutations , variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time .
Evolution acts as a sieve . It sieves out the bad variation .
And so therefore , if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent , you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is , i.e. , if it is important for the mammal to function , for its survival , it will be the same in all of those different lineages , species , taxa .
So therefore , if we were to do this , what we &apos;d need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it &apos;s the same or if it &apos;s different . So if it is the same , this indicates that that site is important for a function , so a disease mutation should fall within that site .
So in this case here , if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow-type genome at that site , it probably suggests that purple is bad .
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently .
So say , for example , the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that &apos;s important for vision .
If we look at that region in mammals that don &apos;t see so well , such as bats , and we find that bats that don &apos;t see so well have the purple type , we know that this is probably what &apos;s causing this disease .
So in my lab , we &apos;ve been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses .
We &apos;re looking at blindness . Now why would you do this ?
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired , and 45 million of these are blind . So blindness is a big problem , and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases , so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease .
Also we look at deafness . One in every 1,000 newborn babies are deaf , and when we reach 80 , over half of us will also have a hearing problem .
Again , there &apos;s many underlying genetic causes for this .
So what we &apos;ve been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists , the bats , and we have looked at genes that cause blindness genes that cause deafness when there &apos;s a defect in them , and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease .
So bats are also important for our health , to enable us to better understand how our genome functions .
So this is where we are right now , but what about the future ?
What about longevity ?
This is where we &apos;re going to go , and as I said before , I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome .
So why should we be interested in aging at all ?
Well , really , this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth . Aging is considered one of the most familiar , yet the least well-understood , aspects of all of biology , and really , since the dawn of civilization , mankind has sought to avoid it .
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
In Europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
As we age , we deteriorate , and this deterioration causes problems for our society , so we have to address it .
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome ? Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years ?
Nobody ? One ? How about 10 years ?
Some ? How about 30 ?
How about 40 ? Okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
This bat is myotis brandtii . It &apos;s the longest-living bat .
It lived for up to 42 years , and this bat &apos;s still alive in the wild today .
But what would be so amazing about this ?
Well , typically , in mammals there is a relationship between body size , metabolic rate , and how long you can live for , and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size .
So typically , small mammals live fast , die young .
Think of a mouse . But bats are very different .
As you can see here on this graph , in blue , these are all other mammals , but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really , really high metabolic rate , and the question is , how can they do that ?
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected , given their body size , than man , and 18 of those are bats .
So therefore , they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses , particularly of flight . They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size , but don &apos;t seem to suffer the consequences or the effects .
So right now , in my lab , we &apos;re combining state-of-the-art bat field biology , going out and catching the long-lived bats , with the most up-to-date , modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do .
And hopefully in the next five years , I &apos;ll be giving you a TEDTalk on that .
Aging is a big problem for humanity , and I believe that by studying bats , we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity . If we find out what they &apos;re doing , perhaps through gene therapy , we can enable us to do the same thing .
Potentially , this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it .
Just imagine what that would be like .
So really , I don &apos;t think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night , but more as our superheroes .
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place . They &apos;re good for our ecosystem , they allow us to understand how our genome functions , and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth .
So tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , I want you to smile . Thank you .
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , &quot; I &apos;m really getting into the Internet lately .
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on eBay .
Take the money ; go to Amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you &apos;ve never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
If I were in charge of the Internet , you could Mapquest your lover &apos;s mood swings .
Hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , U-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin &apos; .
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Some days , I &apos;m as shallow as a baking pan , but I still stretch miles in all directions .
If I owned the Internet , Napster , Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website .
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you &apos;re really just chattin &apos; with your pals .
Heck , if I ran the Web , you could email dead people .
They would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an automated reply .
Their name in your inbox -- it &apos;s all you wanted anyway .
And a message saying , &quot; Hey , it &apos;s me . I miss you .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy . &quot;
If I designed the Internet , childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard , with a ski pole for a sword , trashcan lid for a shield , shouting , &quot; I am the emperor of oranges .
I am the emperor of oranges . I am the emperor of oranges . &quot;
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far .
So if I were emperor of the Internet , I guess I &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
But at that point , I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office .
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;d be like some kind of Internet genius , and me , I &apos;d like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- I &apos;d go wireless .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise , as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle / oracle can get , but , ooh-eee , you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I &apos;m rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net ?
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
It is not a question of if you can -- it &apos;s : do ya ?
We can interfere with the interface .
We can make &quot; You &apos;ve got Hallelujah &quot; the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
You send one blessed email to whomever you &apos;re thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
Thank you , TED .
The new me is beauty .
Yeah , people used to say , &quot; Norman &apos;s OK , but if you followed what he said , everything would be usable but it would be ugly . &quot;
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
This is neat .
Thank you for setting up my display .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And I haven &apos;t the slightest idea of what it does or what it &apos;s good for , but I want it .
And that &apos;s my new life .
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and &quot; pretty , &quot; and &quot; emotions . &quot;
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun .
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer , produced by Alessi .
It &apos;s just neat ; it &apos;s fun . It &apos;s so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway , I don &apos;t use it to make juice .
In fact , I bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says , &quot; Don &apos;t use this juicer to make juice . &quot;
The acid will ruin the gold plating .
So actually , I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture .
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .
It &apos;s a Global cutting knife made in Japan .
First of all , look at the shape -- it &apos;s just wonderful to look at .
Second of all , it &apos;s really beautifully balanced : it holds well , it feels well .
And third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
It &apos;s a delight to use .
And so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
And I can tell you stories about it , which makes it reflective , and so you &apos;ll see I have a theory of emotion .
And those are the three components .
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it , and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it .
And as you play ping-pong , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ripples spread out and the fish run away .
But of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ripples hit the -- poor fish , they can &apos;t find any peace and quiet .
Is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
If you type in , oh say , &quot; emotion and design , &quot; you get 10 pages of results .
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out .
Instead of saying , &quot; You got 73,000 results .
This is one through 20 . Next , &quot; they just give you as many o &apos;s as there are pages .
It &apos;s really simple and subtle .
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it .
That &apos;s the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn &apos;t know why .
And it &apos;s just clever .
And of course , what &apos;s especially good is , if you type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; the first response out of those 10 pages is my website .
Now , the weird thing is Google lies , because if I type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; You don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; We do it anyway . &quot;
So , OK .
So I type &quot; design emotion &quot; and my website wasn &apos;t first again .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile .
It said , &quot; You know , this is a car that has lots of faults .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean , I loved it , I wanted to see it , I rented it , this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car , the whole design is fun .
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
So that &apos;s my new life ; it &apos;s all about fun .
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better , and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ...
I &apos;m going to put a plank on the ground .
So , imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I &apos;m going to walk on it , and you see I can walk on it without looking , I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down .
No problem .
Now I &apos;m going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I &apos;m not going to go near it , thank you .
Intense fear paralyzes you .
It actually affects the way the brain works .
So , Paul Saffo , before his talk said that he didn &apos;t really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk , and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus .
That &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be -- what &apos;s called depth-first processing -- to focus , not be distracted .
And I couldn &apos;t force myself across that .
Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
But it really changes the way you think .
And then , a psychologist , Alice Isen , did this wonderful experiment .
She brought students in to solve problems .
So , she &apos;d bring people into the room , and there &apos;d be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .
It was an empty room , except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff .
And she &apos;d bring them in , and she &apos;d say , &quot; This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life .
Would you tie those two strings together ? &quot;
So they &apos;d take one string and they &apos;d pull it over here and they couldn &apos;t reach the other string .
Still can &apos;t reach it .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
You bring in a second group of people , and you say , &quot; Oh , before we start , I got this box of candy , and I don &apos;t eat candy .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
And turns out they liked it , and it made them happy -- not very happy , but a little bit of happy .
And guess what -- they solved the problem .
And it turns out that when you &apos;re anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth-first .
And when you &apos;re happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes , which makes you a breadth-first problem solver : you &apos;re more susceptible to interruption ; you do out-of-the-box thinking .
That &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
With brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , &quot; No criticism , &quot; and you get all these weird , neat ideas .
But in fact , if that &apos;s how you always were you &apos;d never get any work done because you &apos;d be working along and say , &quot; Oh , I got a new way of doing it . &quot;
So to get work done , you &apos;ve got to set a deadline , right ?
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
The brain works differently if you &apos;re happy . Things work better because you &apos;re more creative .
You get a little problem , you say , &quot; Ah , I &apos;ll figure it out . &quot;
No big deal .
There &apos;s something I call the visceral level of processing , and there will be visceral-level design .
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
That &apos;s especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants , because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed .
There &apos;s an amazing amount of stuff that &apos;s built into the brain .
We dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures .
We dislike scolding voices . We dislike frowning faces ; we like symmetrical faces , etc . , etc .
So that &apos;s the visceral level .
In design , you can express visceral in lots of ways , like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot , exciting .
Or the 1963 Jaguar : It &apos;s actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it .
And it &apos;s beautiful -- it &apos;s in the Museum of Modern Art .
A water bottle : You buy it because of the bottle , not because of the water .
And when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
They keep it for -- you know , it &apos;s like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it &apos;s not the water .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that &apos;s actually where most of our stuff gets done .
Visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Behavioral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Almost everything we do is subconscious .
I &apos;m walking around the stage -- I &apos;m not attending to the control of my legs .
I &apos;m doing a lot ; most of my talk is subconscious ; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot .
Most of what we do is subconscious .
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side .
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usability , understanding -- but also the feel and heft .
That &apos;s why the Global knives are so neat .
They &apos;re so nicely balanced , so sharp , that you really feel you &apos;re in control of the cutting .
Or , just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again , feeling that you are in complete control of the environment .
Or the sensual feeling .
This is a Kohler shower , a waterfall shower , and actually , all those knobs beneath are also showerheads .
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water , by the way , because it recirculates the same dirty water .
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago .
It &apos;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot .
That &apos;s kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back , and you put tea in , and then you fill it with water .
The water then seeps over the tea .
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line .
There &apos;s a little ledge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that .
And when the tea is ready , or almost ready , you tilt it .
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing .
And when it &apos;s finished , you put it vertically , and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out .
On top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
Cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax .
And that &apos;s why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we &apos;ve evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion .
Well , this has emotions if you like , because it signals the waiter that , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m finished . See -- upright . &quot;
And the waiter can come by and say , &quot; Would you like more water ? &quot;
It &apos;s kind of neat . What a wonderful design .
And the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
It looks over what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s that little voice in your head that &apos;s watching and saying , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s bad . &quot;
Or , &quot; Why are you doing that ? I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
It &apos;s that little voice in your head that &apos;s the seat of consciousness .
Here &apos;s a great reflective product .
Owners of the Hummer have said , &quot; You know I &apos;ve owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars , but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention . &quot;
It &apos;s about attention . It &apos;s about their image , not about the car .
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car .
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment .
And you &apos;ll buy it to protect the environment , even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected .
But that &apos;s reflective design as well .
Or an expensive watch , so you can impress people -- &quot; Oh gee , I didn &apos;t know you had that watch . &quot;
As opposed to this one , which is a pure behavioral watch , which probably keeps better time than the $ 13,000 watch I just showed you .
But it &apos;s ugly .
This is a clear Don Norman watch .
And what &apos;s neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other , the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying , &quot; It &apos;s OK . It &apos;s OK . It &apos;s safe . It &apos;s safe . &quot;
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart , you &apos;d never go on the ride .
So , it &apos;s pitting one against the other .
The other neat thing ...
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
And this is his chair with claw , and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it &apos;s trying to get it back before anybody notices .
And what &apos;s so neat about it is how you accept that story .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
So that &apos;s the new me .
I &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
Well , the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East , of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels .
To the first son , he left half the camels .
To the second son , he left a third of the camels , and to the youngest son , he left a ninth of the camels .
Well three sons got into a negotiation .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
Brotherly tempers started to get strained .
Finally , in desperation , they went and they consulted a wise old woman .
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time , and finally she came back and said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know if I can help you , but at least , if you want , you can have my camel . &quot;
So then they had 18 camels .
The first son took his half -- half of 18 is nine .
The second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six .
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two .
You get 17 .
They had one camel left over .
They gave it back to the wise old woman .
Now if you think about that story for a moment , I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .
They start off like 17 camels -- no way to resolve it .
Somehow , what we need to do is step back from those situations , like that wise old woman , look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel .
Now finding that 18th camel in the world &apos;s conflicts has been my life passion .
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .
We &apos;re all one family .
We know that scientifically , thanks to the communications revolution , all the tribes on the planet , all 15,000 tribes , are in touch with each other .
And it &apos;s a big family reunion , and yet , like many family reunions , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
There &apos;s a lot of conflict , and the question is , how do we deal with our differences ?
How do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction ?
That &apos;s the question .
As I &apos;ve spent the last better part of three decades , almost four , traveling the world , trying to work , getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela , some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet , I &apos;ve been asking myself that question .
And I think I &apos;ve found , in some ways , what is the secret to peace .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
It &apos;s not even new .
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages .
The secret to peace is us .
It &apos;s us who act as the surrounding community around any conflict , who can play a constructive role .
Let me give you just a story , an example .
About 20 years ago , I was in South Africa working with the parties in that conflict , and I had an extra month , so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen .
I was curious about them and about the way in which they resolve conflict .
Because , after all , within living memory , they were hunters and gatherers , living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story .
And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting -- absolutely fatal .
So how do they deal with their differences ?
Well what I learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities , someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush , and then everyone sits around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk .
It may take two days , three days , four days , but they don &apos;t rest until they find a resolution , or better yet , a reconciliation .
And if tempers are still too high , then they send someone off to visit some relatives as a cooling-off period .
Well that system is , I think , probably the system that kept us alive to this point , given our human tendencies .
That system , I call the &quot; third side . &quot;
Because if you think about it , normally when we think of conflict , when we describe it , there &apos;s always two sides -- it &apos;s Arabs versus Israelis , labor versus management , husband versus wife , Republicans versus Democrats .
But what we don &apos;t often see is that there &apos;s always a third side , and the third side of the conflict is us , it &apos;s the surrounding community , it &apos;s the friends , the allies , the family members , the neighbors .
And we can play an incredibly constructive role .
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what &apos;s really at stake .
For the sake of the kids , for the sake of the family , for the sake of the community , for the sake of the future , let &apos;s stop fighting for a moment and start talking .
Because , the thing is , when we &apos;re involved in conflict , it &apos;s very easy to lose perspective .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
And as the saying goes , when angry , you will make the best speech you will ever regret .
And so the third side reminds us of that .
The third side helps us go to the balcony , which is a metaphor for a place of perspective , where we can keep our eyes on the prize .
Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience .
Some years ago , I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya .
There was a war going on , as you know .
And we met in the Hague , in the Peace Palace , in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .
And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said , &quot; You should stay right here in your seats , because you &apos;re going to be on trial for war crimes . &quot;
And then he went on , and then he turned to me and said , &quot; You &apos;re an American .
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico . &quot;
And my mind started racing , &quot; Puerto Rico ? What do I know about Puerto Rico ? &quot;
I started reacting , but then I tried to remember to go to the balcony .
And then when he paused , and everyone looked at me for a response , from a balcony perspective , I was able to thank him for his remarks and say , &quot; I appreciate your criticism of my country , and I take it as a sign that we &apos;re among friends and can speak candidly to one another .
And what we &apos;re here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past .
What we &apos;re here to do is to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya . &quot;
The conversation got back on track .
That &apos;s the role of the third side , is to help the parties to go to the balcony .
Now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s widely regarded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the Middle East .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
Now I don &apos;t pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict , but I think I &apos;ve got a first step , literally , a first step , something that any one of us could do as third-siders .
Let me just ask you one question first .
How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do ?
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
Okay , so the great majority of us .
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
Is it the number of deaths ?
There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East .
No , it &apos;s because of the story , because we feel personally involved in that story .
Whether we &apos;re Christians , Muslims or Jews , religious or non-religious , we feel we have a personal stake in it .
Stories matter . As an anthropologist , I know that .
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
They give meaning to our lives .
That &apos;s what we tell here at TED , we tell stories .
Stories are the key .
And so my question is , yes , let &apos;s try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East , but let &apos;s also take a look at the story .
Let &apos;s try to get at the root of what it &apos;s all about .
Let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
What would that mean ? What is the story there ?
Now as anthropologists , we know that every culture has an origin story .
What &apos;s the origin story of the Middle East ?
In a phrase , it &apos;s : 4,000 years ago , a man and his family walked across the Middle East , and the world has never been the same since .
That man , of course , was Abraham .
And what he stood for was unity , the unity of the family .
He &apos;s the father of us all .
But it &apos;s not just what he stood for , it &apos;s what his message was .
His basic message was unity too , the interconnectedness of it all , the unity of it all , and his basic value was respect , was kindness toward strangers .
That &apos;s what he &apos;s known for , his hospitality .
So in that sense , he &apos;s the symbolic third side of the Middle East .
He &apos;s the one who reminds us that we &apos;re all part of a greater whole .
Now how would you -- now think about that for a moment .
Today we face the scourge of terrorism .
What is terrorism ?
Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear .
What &apos;s the opposite of terrorism ?
It &apos;s taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding , or respect , or love .
So what if then you took the story of Abraham , which is a third side story , what if that could be -- because Abraham stands for hospitality -- what if that could be an antidote to terrorism ?
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
How would you bring that story to life ?
Now it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story -- that &apos;s powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
They need to be able to live the story . How would you do that ?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that .
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
Because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk .
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham .
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham .
Because walking has a real power .
You know , as an anthropologist , walking is what made us human .
Walking , it &apos;s funny , when you walk , you walk side-by-side in the same common direction .
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you , you would feel threatened .
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder , even touching shoulders , it &apos;s no problem .
Who fights while they walk ?
That &apos;s why in negotiations , often , when things get tough , people go for walks in the woods .
So the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path , a route -- think the silk route , think the Appalachian trail -- that followed in the footsteps of Abraham .
People said , &quot; That &apos;s crazy . You can &apos;t .
You can &apos;t retrace the footsteps of Abraham . It &apos;s too insecure .
You &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
It goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East , because it unites them all . &quot;
And so we studied the idea at Harvard .
We did our due diligence .
And then a few years ago , a group of us , about 25 of us from about 10 different countries , decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham , going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey , Northern Mesopotamia .
And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran , where , in the Bible , he sets off on his journey .
Then we crossed the border into Syria , went to Aleppo , which , turns out , is named after Abraham .
We went to Damascus , which has a long history associated with Abraham .
We then came to Northern Jordan , to Jerusalem , which is all about Abraham , to Bethlehem , and finally to the place where he &apos;s buried in Hebron .
So effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
We showed it could be done . It was an amazing journey .
Let me ask you a question .
How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood , or strange land , and a total stranger , perfect stranger , comes up to you and shows you some kindness , maybe invites you into their home , gives you a drink , gives you a coffee , gives you a meal ?
How many of you have ever had that experience ?
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
But that &apos;s what you discover , is you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility , and you get the most amazing hospitality , all associated with Abraham .
&quot; In the name of father Abraham , let me offer you some food . &quot;
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .
He &apos;s alive ; he &apos;s a living presence .
And to make a long story short , in the last couple of years now , thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East , enjoying the hospitality of the people there .
They &apos;ve begun to walk in Israel and Palestine , in Jordan , in Turkey , in Syria .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
Men , women , young people , old people -- more women than men , actually , interestingly .
For those who can &apos;t walk , who are unable to get there right now , people started to organize walks in cities , in their own communities .
In Cincinnati , for instance , that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together .
It was Abraham Path Day .
In Sao Paulo , Brazil , it &apos;s become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run , uniting the different communities .
The media love it ; they really adore it .
They lavish attention on it because it &apos;s visual , and it spreads the idea , this idea of Abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers .
And just a couple weeks ago , there was an NPR story on it .
Last month , there was a piece in the Guardian , in the Manchester Guardian , about it -- two whole pages .
And they quoted a villager who said , &quot; This walk connects us to the world . &quot;
He said it was like a light that went on in our lives .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
But it &apos;s not just about psychology ; it &apos;s about economics , because as people walk they spend money .
And this woman right here , Um Ahmad , is a woman who lives on a path in Northern Jordan .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
She &apos;s partially blind , her husband can &apos;t work , she &apos;s got seven kids .
But what she can do is cook , and so she &apos;s begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
She makes the most delicious food that &apos;s fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside .
And so more and more walkers have come , and lately she &apos;s begun to earn an income to support her family .
And so she told our team there , she said , &quot; You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me . &quot;
That &apos;s the potential of the Abraham path .
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East , across the path .
The potential is basically to change the game .
And to change the game , you have to change the frame , the way we see things -- to change the frame from hostility to hospitality , from terrorism to tourism .
And in that sense , the Abraham path is a game-changer .
Let me just show you one thing .
I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year .
Now the acorn is associated with the oak tree , of course -- grows into an oak tree , which is associated with Abraham .
The path right now is like an acorn ; it &apos;s still in its early phase .
What would the oak tree look like ?
Well I think back to my childhood , a good part of which I spent , after being born here in Chicago , I spent in Europe .
If you had been in the ruins of , say , London in 1945 , or Berlin , and you had said , &quot; Sixty years from now , this is going to be the most peaceful , prosperous part of the planet , &quot; people would have thought you were certifiably insane .
But they did it thanks to a common identity -- Europe -- and a common economy .
So my question is , if it can be done in Europe , why not in the Middle East ?
Why not , thanks to a common identity , which is the story of Abraham , and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism ?
So let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years , as I &apos;ve worked in some of the most dangerous , difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet , I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed .
It &apos;s not easy , of course , but it &apos;s possible .
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It could be done anywhere .
It simply depends on us .
It depends on us taking the third side .
So let me invite you to consider taking the third side , even as a very small step .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
Just go up to someone who &apos;s from a different culture , a different country , a different ethnicity , some difference , and engage them in a conversation ; listen to them .
That &apos;s a third side act .
That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s path .
After a TEDTalk , why not a TEDWalk ?
So let me just leave you with three things .
One is , the secret to peace is the third side .
The third side is us .
Each of us , with a single step , can take the world , can bring the world a step closer to peace .
There &apos;s an old African proverb that goes : &quot; When spider webs unite , they can halt even the lion . &quot;
If we &apos;re able to unite our third-side webs of peace , we can even halt the lion of war .
Thank you very much .
Good morning everyone . First of all , it &apos;s been fantastic being here over these past few days .
And secondly , I feel it &apos;s a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people , these amazing talks that we &apos;ve had .
I feel that I &apos;ve fitted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I &apos;ve heard .
I came directly here from the deep , deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador , where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses , where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies , and keep the roads , out of their forests .
They &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t contaminated , a world that isn &apos;t polluted .
And what was so amazing to me , and what fits right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at TED , is that there , right in the middle of this rainforest , was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down .
The water was cleaned , but because they got a lot of batteries , they were able to store a lot of electricity .
So every house -- and there were , I think , eight houses in this little community -- could have light for , I think it was about half an hour each evening .
And there is the Chief , in all his regal finery , with a laptop computer .
And this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; You know , we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world .
We want to know about health care .
We want to know about what other people do -- we &apos;re interested in it .
And we want to learn other languages .
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese , and we &apos;re good at languages . &quot;
So there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt , the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank , IMF , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil .
And so , coming directly from there to here .
But , of course , my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can &apos;t really call it a civilization .
A different way of life , a different being .
We &apos;ve talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
And I propose to bring into this TED conference , as I always do around the world , the voice of the animal kingdom .
Too often we just see a few slides , or a bit of film , but these beings have voices that mean something .
And so , I want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
I &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960 .
During that time , there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work .
For example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time , we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant .
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society .
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is , GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps .
And we &apos;re using -- you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff -- but we &apos;re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area .
And of course , there &apos;s developments in infrared , so you can watch animals at night , and equipment for recording by video , and tape recording is getting lighter and better .
So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when I began in 1960 .
Especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals .
So that we know today , they &apos;re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began .
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
She loves her computer -- she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything .
And she &apos;ll come in to sit at this computer -- it &apos;s like a video game for a kid ; she &apos;s hooked .
She &apos;s 28 , by the way , and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans .
She does very complex tasks , and I haven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn &apos;t like making mistakes .
If she has a bad run , and her score isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can &apos;t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go .
And her concentration -- she &apos;s already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wants to do it all over again , just for the satisfaction of having done it better .
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward , like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her beforehand .
So here we are , a chimpanzee using a computer .
Chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans also learn human sign language .
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday -- the first time , when I was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and I peered with my binoculars .
It was , fortunately , one adult male whom I &apos;d named David Greybeard -- and by the way , science at that time was telling me that I shouldn &apos;t name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
Anyway , David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest .
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making .
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools .
When I was at school , we were defined as man , the toolmaker .
So that when Louis Leakey , my mentor , heard this news , he said , &quot; Ah , we must now redefine &apos; man , &apos; redefine &apos; tool , &apos; or accept chimpanzees as humans . &quot;
We now know that at Gombe alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes .
Moreover , we know that in different parts of Africa , wherever chimps have been studied , there are completely different tool-using behaviors .
And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture .
What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as I say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom .
It &apos;s a very wuzzy line .
It &apos;s getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we , in our arrogance , used to think was just human .
The chimps -- there &apos;s no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood , five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother , and then another three , four or five years of emotional dependence on her , even when the next child is born .
The importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible -- and there &apos;s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society .
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the wild so far .
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds , which they use in different circumstances , but they also use touch , posture , gesture , and what do they do ?
They kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
They pat one another on the back ; they swagger ; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context .
They have very sophisticated cooperation .
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often , but when they hunt , they show sophisticated cooperation , and they share the prey .
We find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
They know mental as well as physical suffering .
And I don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you , save to say that there are very bright students , in the best universities , studying emotions in animals , studying personalities in animals .
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- &quot; self &quot; as opposed to &quot; other . &quot;
They have a sense of humor , and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives .
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it &apos;s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , I suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .
Once we &apos;re prepared to admit that after all , we &apos;re not the only beings with personalities , minds and above all feelings , and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient , sapient creatures on this planet , it really gives cause for deep shame , at least for me .
So , the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little humility -- are in the wild , disappearing very fast .
They &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
The deforestation , the growth of human populations , needing more land .
They &apos;re disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting .
They &apos;re disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber .
And this has led in Congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade .
This means that although for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , people have lived in those forests , or whatever habitat it is , in harmony with their world , just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now , suddenly , because of the roads , the hunters can go in from the towns .
They shoot everything , every single thing that moves that &apos;s bigger than a small rat ; they sun-dry it or smoke it .
And now they &apos;ve got transport ; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it .
And people will pay more for bush-meat , as it &apos;s called , than for domestic meat -- it &apos;s culturally preferred .
And it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
They &apos;re given weapons ; they shoot for the logging camps ; they get money .
Their culture is being destroyed , along with the animals upon whom they depend .
So , when the logging camp moves , there &apos;s nothing left .
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity , and I &apos;ve seen it happening with my own eyes .
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa , and what do we see in Africa ?
We see deforestation ; we see the desert spreading ; we see massive hunger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support , and they &apos;re too poor to buy food from elsewhere .
Were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the Easter Island , who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid ?
Didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
Of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; Let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot;
&quot; How am I going to feed my family today ?
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we &apos;ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end . &quot;
So , this is a pretty grim picture .
The one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
We can talk about the distant past , plan for the distant future , discuss ideas with each other , so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we &apos;re destroying the world .
In the developed world , in a way , it &apos;s worse , because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we &apos;re doing .
Do you know , we &apos;re bringing little babies into a world where , in many places , the water is poisoning them ?
And the air is harming them , and the food that &apos;s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them .
And that &apos;s not just in the far-away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
And so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
We &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature , that brought us into being ; Mother Nature , where I believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development .
And yet , there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality , with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun , or in the forest , with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above .
As I was traveling around the world , you know , I had to leave the forest -- that &apos;s where I love to be .
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because , finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now , I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world .
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees &apos; plight , the more I realized the fact that everything &apos;s interconnected , and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world , and everything was joining together , and making -- not sense , hope lies in sense , you said -- it &apos;s making a nonsense .
How can we do it ?
Somebody said that yesterday .
And as I was traveling around , I kept meeting young people who &apos;d lost hope .
They were feeling despair , they were feeling , &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die .
Everything is hopeless -- we &apos;re always being told so by the media . &quot;
And then I met some who were angry , and anger that can turn to violence , and we &apos;re all familiar with that .
And I have three little grandchildren , and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university , they &apos;d say , &quot; We &apos;re angry , &quot; or &quot; We &apos;re filled with despair , because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future , and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot;
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we &apos;ve harmed this planet since I was their age .
I feel this deep shame , and that &apos;s why in 1991 in Tanzania , I started a program that &apos;s called Roots and Shoots .
There &apos;s little brochures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , I beg that you pick up that brochure .
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope .
Roots make a firm foundation .
Shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls .
See the brick walls as all the problems that we &apos;ve inflicted on this planet .
Then , you see , it is a message of hope .
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through , and can make this a better world .
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
Every individual has a role to play .
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re breathing oxygen and giving out CO2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that -- you &apos;re making a difference in the world .
So , the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects .
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
One project to show care and concern for your own human community .
One for animals , including domestic animals -- and I have to say , I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog , Rusty , who was my childhood companion .
And the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
So what the kids do depends first of all , how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university .
It &apos;s going to depend whether they &apos;re inner-city or rural .
It &apos;s going to depend if they &apos;re wealthy or impoverished .
It &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of America they &apos;re in .
We &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
It &apos;s going to depend on which country they &apos;re in -- and we &apos;re already in 60-plus countries , with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I &apos;ve never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves .
Why ?
Because they &apos;re buying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to decide what they &apos;re going to do .
It isn &apos;t something that their parents tell them , or their teachers tell them .
That &apos;s effective , but if they decide themselves , &quot; We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
We want to go and work in a dog shelter .
We want to learn about animals . We want ... &quot; You know , it goes on and on , and this is very hopeful for me .
As I travel around the world 300 days a year , everywhere there &apos;s a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages .
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying , &quot; Look at the difference we &apos;ve made . &quot;
And now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world .
And if anyone is interested to help us , we &apos;ve got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement .
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; We &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot;
And then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in Israel , saying , &quot; Yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . &quot;
The philosophy is very simple .
We do not believe in violence .
No violence , no bombs , no guns .
That &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
Violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
So how do we solve ?
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding .
Know the facts , but see how they fit in the big picture .
Hard work and persistence --don &apos;t give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life .
How many more minutes ? Two , one ?
One -- one to two .
Jane Goodall : Two , two , I &apos;m going to take two .
Are you going to come and drag me off ?
Anyway -- so basically , Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people &apos;s lives .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m devoting most of my energy to .
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you .
And it &apos;s been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
It &apos;s very encouraging .
But the kids do ask me -- and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , I promise -- the kids say , &quot; Dr. Jane , do you really have hope for the future ?
You travel , you see all these horrible things happening . &quot;
Firstly , the human brain -- I don &apos;t need to say anything about that .
Now that we know what the problems are around the world , human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems .
And we &apos;ve talked a lot about that .
Secondly , the resilience of nature .
We can destroy a river , and we can bring it back to life .
We can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help .
And thirdly , the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last , talked about the indomitable human spirit .
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath .
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless , there was so much human courage , so much love and so much compassion .
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn &apos;t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi , &quot; If you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot;
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell , and I want to end on this note .
She said , &quot; If you &apos;re talking about hope and peace , ring this .
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine , from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled .
So , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ?
Is it out there with the politicians ?
It &apos;s in our hands .
It &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
It &apos;s really up to us .
We &apos;re the ones who can make a difference .
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints , if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don &apos;t buy the things that are not , we can change the world overnight .
Thank you .
From all outward appearances , John had everything going for him .
He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit , and he &apos;d only owned it for five years .
The school where he graduated from with his master &apos;s had just offered him a teaching appointment , which meant not only a salary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
And yet , despite everything going really well for John , he was struggling , fighting addiction and a gripping depression .
On the night of June 11th , 2003 , he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below .
Remarkably -- no , miraculously -- he lived .
The fall shattered his right arm , broke every rib that he had , punctured his lung , and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River , under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry , where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain , contacted the boat &apos;s captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital .
And that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together -- first physically , then emotionally , and then spiritually -- he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did .
Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail .
But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time .
This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them .
And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life , because of our taboos around suicide , we &apos;re not sure what to say , and so quite often we say nothing .
And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in .
I know John &apos;s story very well because I &apos;m John .
And this is , today , the first time in any sort of public setting I &apos;ve ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on .
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at TEDActive , I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
As the Trevor Project says , it gets better .
It gets way better .
And I &apos;m choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you , to urge you , that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide , or you know somebody who has , talk about it ; get help .
It &apos;s a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; American Idol &quot; watchers .
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani , who is a contestant , indeed a finalist , in the Poet of the Millions competition , which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi , and seen throughout the Arab world .
In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry , in the Nabati form of poetry , which is the traditional Bedouin form .
And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition .
Now , before I go any further , yes , I know it all began with &quot; Britain &apos;s Got Talent . &quot;
But my point in discussing this is to show you -- I hope I &apos;ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by SMS , are changing tribal societies .
And I &apos;m going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE , how they &apos;re changing tribal societies , not by introducing Western ideas , but by being integrated into the language in those places .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are late to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
We are going to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; We are late .
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
In Afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have to have your own TV set .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
But it goes beyond watching , because also , part of this is campaigning .
People become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the countryside , campaigning for their candidate .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
Now , of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance , but not entirely .
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
One of them , Lima Sahar , is a Pashtun from Kandahar , a very conservative part of the country .
And here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; Afghan Star , &quot; how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her .
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition .
I have to say , her husband backed her from the start .
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it .
But , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .
And she &apos;s out there .
Her poetry is about women , and the life of women in society .
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
Now you &apos;d think that &quot; American Idol &quot; would introduce a measure of Americanization .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
By using this engaging popular format for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the Gulf , is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music .
And for Afghanistan , where the Taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music .
They don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music .
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully , without avenging the winner .
No small thing .
And the final , sort of , formulation of this &quot; American Idol &quot; format , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called &quot; The Candidate . &quot;
And in this program , people present policy platforms that are then voted on .
Many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
So for me , the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality .
Thank you .
An image is worth more than a thousand words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured .
So by now , my talk is already 6,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here .
At the same time , I probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw .
What I am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together .
Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it &apos;s bursting , as you can see in this image , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint , strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways , or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces , I &apos;m always trying to link those two fields together .
What I find very intriguing about those two is that they both look at the same thing : They are a response to their surroundings .
And yet , they do it in a very different way .
If you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its surroundings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings .
What I am trying to do is I &apos;m trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer &apos;s heart but also to the viewer &apos;s brain .
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
Now as you may know , sound travels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal , transform it into a vibration , which is then transported through the air , is captured by our ear , and transformed into an audio signal again .
Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound waves visible ?
So I came up with the following setup .
I took a speaker , I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
And now , if I would play a sound through that speaker , it would cause the crystals to move up and down .
Now this happens very fast , in the blink of an eye , so , together with LG , we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second .
Let me show you what this looks like .
Thank you very much .
I agree , it looks pretty amazing .
But I have to tell you a funny story .
I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles .
Now in Los Angeles , you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches , but I got mine indoors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re shooting at 3,000 frames per second , you need to have a silly amount of light , lots of lights .
So we had this speaker set up , and we had the camera facing it , and lots of lights pointing at the speaker , and I would set up the speaker , put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker , and we would do this over and over again , and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker .
What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week .
Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
Ah , some of you have . Excellent .
Should I skip that part ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic .
So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field , it would change its appearance .
Now I &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
So I &apos;ve got a camera pointing down at this plate , and underneath that plate , there is a magnet .
Now I &apos;m going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet .
Let &apos;s just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more . Excellent .
So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid .
Now this looks already quite interesting , but let me now add some watercolors to it .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
You wouldn &apos;t paint with syringes , but it works just the same .
So what happened now is , when the watercolor was flowing into the structure , the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid .
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
And at the same time , it tries to maintain its position above the magnet , and therefore , it creates those amazing-looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint .
So that was the second project .
Let me now turn to the last project , which involves the national beverage of Scotland .
This image , and also this one , were made using whiskey .
Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures .
Now , whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol , and alcohol has got some very interesting properties .
Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before , but I am talking about the physical properties , not the other ones .
So when I open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very volatile substance .
And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you &apos;re seeing right now .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey .
Add some more .
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive .
I could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey , and that I should rather drink it .
But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration .
So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom , burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol .
So the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
Thank you .
So , I have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Is it just some strange materials ?
Those three projects , they &apos;re based on very simple scientific phenomena , such as magnetism , the sound waves , or over here , the physical properties of a substance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way , and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us .
Thank you very much .
By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
He said , &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote -- the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot;
Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content -- the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts -- that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms -- interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
Thank you very much .
I am a cultural omnivore , one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod -- an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart , pop diva Christina Aguilera , country singer Josh Turner , gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin , concerti , symphonies and more and more .
I &apos;m a voracious reader , a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer .
I have read the &quot; Twilight &quot; tetralogy .
And one who lives for my home theater , a home theater where I devour DVDs , video-on-demand and a lot of television .
For me , &quot; Law and Order : SVU , &quot; Tine Fey and &quot; 30 Rock &quot; and &quot; Judge Judy &quot; -- &quot; The people are real , the cases are real , the rulings are final . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for Judge Judy , and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but I &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
You know , frankly it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the Internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard .
Depending on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer , now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day .
We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .
Five years ago , Gen-X &apos;ers spent 20.7 hours online and TV , the majority on TV .
Gen-Y &apos;ers spent even more -- 23.8 hours , the majority online .
And now , a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent 20,000 hours online and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games -- a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined .
Moreover , we &apos;re afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption .
Thanks to the Internet , we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it , delivered to our own doorstep .
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night , ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body-types .
Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -- which have set curtain times , set venues , attendant inconveniences of travel , parking and the like -- simply cannot meet .
And we &apos;re all acutely aware : what &apos;s it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony , opera or ballet ticket , when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free ?
These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain .
But as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
All of us are engaged in a seismic , fundamental realignment of culture and communications , a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry , the magazine industry , the book and publishing industry and more .
Saddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming , locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues , where we charge exorbitant prices .
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves , &quot; Are we next ? &quot;
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich , who , in &quot; Dreams of a Common Language , &quot; wrote , &quot; We are out in a country that has no language , no laws .
Whatever we do together is pure invention .
The maps they gave us are out of date by years . &quot;
And for those of you who love the arts , aren &apos;t you glad you invited me here to brighten your day ?
Now , rather than saying that we &apos;re on the brink of our own annihilation , I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation , a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century .
The arts reformation , like the religious Reformation , is spurred in part by technology , with indeed , the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation .
Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion , internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models .
And at heart , both reformations , I think were asking the questions : who &apos;s entitled to practice ?
How are they entitled to practice ?
And indeed , do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?
Chris Anderson , someone I trust you all know , editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of &quot; The Long Tail , &quot; really was the first -- for me -- to nail a lot of this .
He wrote a long time ago , you know , thanks to the invention of the Internet , web technology , mini-cams and more , the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history .
In the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ?
And now who in this room doesn &apos;t know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second , third , or fourth movie ?
Similarly , the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history .
Again , in the &apos; 30s , Warner Brothers , RKO did that for you .
Now , go to YouTube , Facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom .
This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market , a time when anyone is a potential author .
Frankly , what we &apos;re seeing now in this environment is a massive time , when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting .
But the number of arts participants , people who write poetry , who sing songs , who perform in church choirs , is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations .
This group , others have called the &quot; pro ams , &quot; amateur artists doing work at a professional level .
You see them on YouTube , in dance competitions , film festivals and more .
They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary , while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions .
Ultimately , we now live in a world defined not by consumption , but by participation .
But I want to be clear , just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .
They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -- not opulence -- of dignity .
And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home .
But to view them as synonymous is , by far , too short-sighted .
And indeed , while we &apos;ve tended to polarize the amateur from the professional , the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist , the professional artist who works , not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage ; but most frequently around women &apos;s rights , or human rights , or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more -- not out of economic necessity , but out of a deep , organic conviction that the work that she or he , is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment .
Today &apos;s dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada , but by Liz Lerman &apos;s Dance Exchange -- a multi-generational , professional dance company , whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 , and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN .
Today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals , but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the Bahia , the Catholic , the Muslim , the Jewish , even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross-community healing .
Today &apos;s performers , like Rhodessa Jones , work in women &apos;s prisons , helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration , while today &apos;s playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more .
And indeed , I think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
You know , we &apos;ve said for a long time , we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town .
And absolutely -- I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy , dollars spent in restaurants or on parking , at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes , the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more .
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward , especially in industries we can &apos;t even imagine yet , just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries , which few , if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago .
Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence , the ability to listen deeply , to have empathy , to articulate change , to motivate others -- the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter .
Especially now , as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation , uninformed by social conscience ; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters , and especially characters of the young people , who all too often , are subjected to bombardment of sensation , rather than digested experience .
Ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws , in reality TV that thrives on humiliation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repeatedly , day-in , day-out in the United States , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; Ladies and gentlemen , please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you , &quot; when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion .
The arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together , invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity .
God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now .
You know , we &apos;re bound together , not , I think by technology , entertainment and design , but by common cause .
We work to promote healthy vibrant societies , to ameliorate human suffering , to promote a more thoughtful , substantive , empathic world order .
I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work , whatever your purpose may be .
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come .
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .
Thank you , and godspeed .
Do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
Heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
Most of us worry about things we can &apos;t control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti .
But what really threatens humanity ?
A few years ago , Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
He called these , &quot; massively fatal discontinuities , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
He looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the Earth .
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
Now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
Every year , 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu .
In the developing world , the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher .
You know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic .
In 1918 , a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .
It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .
Are we safer today ?
Well , we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared , but this threat could reappear at any time .
The good news is that we &apos;re at a moment in time when science , technology , globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility : the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth .
We can do this .
We &apos;re already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
But with new or better vaccines for malaria , TB , HIV , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time .
So , I &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
But first , I have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
When they work , they can make history , but after a while you can barely hear them .
Now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children .
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
Or polio ? How many of you remember the iron lung ?
We don &apos;t see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
Now , it &apos;s interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we &apos;re still threatened by things like HIV and flu .
Why is that ?
Well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
Until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
You took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
This worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for HIV , for which humans have no natural immunity .
So let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed .
Now , when you get a viral infection , what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength , and that might be too late .
When you &apos;re pre-immunized , what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .
So that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
Now , let &apos;s take a look at a video that we &apos;re debuting at TED , for the first time , on how an effective HIV vaccine might work .
A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader .
After HIV penetrates the body &apos;s mucosal barriers , it infects immune cells to replicate .
The invader draws the attention of the immune system &apos;s front-line troops .
Dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front-line troops .
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells , which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells , while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected .
The virus is defeated .
Without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
By that time , the battle against HIV would already have been lost .
Seth Berkley : Really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
The antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work .
So the real question then is : How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV ?
The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
So let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
In this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you .
And also , what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus .
When these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at anymore .
So that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
It &apos;s also why in the spring , we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year , put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall .
Even worse , the most common influenza -- influenza A -- also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans , and they can recombine in those particular animals .
In addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
So , you &apos;ve got this situation : In 2003 , we had an H5N1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
Now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
This year &apos;s H1N1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in Mexico .
It was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
And so , in a sense , our luck is holding out , but you know , another wild bird could fly over at anytime .
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
As variable as flu is , HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar .
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted .
It mutates furiously , it has decoys to evade the immune system , it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
Here &apos;s a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV , a much wilder target .
In the video a moment ago , you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells .
Now realize that in a recently infected person , there are millions of these ships ; each one is just slightly different .
Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder .
Now , in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together .
These drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence at least for those who can access them .
The vaccine effort though is really quite different .
Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business .
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
In September , we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand .
For the first time , we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans -- albeit , quite modestly -- and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
But in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual .
Now , what does this mean ?
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models , they provide full protection from infection .
In addition , these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto , and what &apos;s so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
It &apos;s like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it &apos;s still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine , and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
This strategy , working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research .
It &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV .
So think of it this way .
We &apos;ve got these new antibodies we &apos;ve identified , and we know that they latch onto many , many variations of the virus .
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part , so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part , present that through a vaccine , what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies .
And that would create a universal HIV vaccine .
Now , it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site , and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this , we &apos;d love to hear about it .
But , you know , the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
So for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
They &apos;re currently making a cocktail -- an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat severe , overwhelming cases of flu .
In the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
Now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
Let me give you another example .
We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
Notice these other , smaller protuberances .
These are largely hidden from the immune system .
Now it turns out that these spots also don &apos;t change much when the virus mutates .
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
So far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
So if this works in humans , what we &apos;re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
We really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
Of course , the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it .
So to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
In June , the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years .
The U.S. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15th for the flu peak .
Vaccines were promised to developing countries .
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing .
So what happened ?
Well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce them , in the early 1940s .
It was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
Viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
For most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
Luckily for us , we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances .
So today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
Almost nothing has changed .
The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
This year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
So , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
What if that wild bird flies by again ?
You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks , and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines .
So , Dan &#91; Barber &#93; , if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm , I know where to get them .
So right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
But this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
Well , with the new technologies emerging now , I hope we can say definitively , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we &apos;re currently spending now in the United States .
With a range of new technologies , we could .
Here &apos;s an example : A company I &apos;m engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system .
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they &apos;ve created a very powerful flu fighter .
This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , E. coli .
Now , as you know , bacteria reproduce quickly -- it &apos;s like making yogurt -- and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories , in a few weeks , with no eggs , for a fraction of the cost of current methods .
So here &apos;s a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
And , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the E. coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
The developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they &apos;re leapfrogging the West .
India , Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap , billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them .
Now think of where this leads us .
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
Some day , perhaps soon , we &apos;ll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
Luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
I say , &quot; luckily &quot; in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated .
So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology , and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year .
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year .
No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
Instead of having Vaclav Smil &apos;s &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
What the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
In your mind , Seth -- I mean , you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on , let &apos;s start with HIV , for a game-changing vaccine that &apos;s actually out there and usable ?
SB : The game change can come at any time , because the problem we have now is we &apos;ve shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans ; we just need a better one .
And with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
So , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what &apos;s interesting is there already is some evidence that we &apos;re beginning to crack that problem .
So , the challenge is full speed ahead .
In your gut , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?
SB : You know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
And that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
SB : I think flu is different . I think what happened with flu is we &apos;ve got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
They look good . The problem has been that , what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that &apos;s what we were comfortable with .
You also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
That &apos;s what Europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what Michael Specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .
And malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
SB : No , malaria , there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now .
It probably isn &apos;t the perfect vaccine , but it &apos;s moving along .
Seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
You &apos;ve been slaving away at this for more than a decade , and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do .
The world needs people like you . Thank you .
SB : Thank you .
I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
It was deep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking .
Everything in my room was shaking -- my heart , my windows , my bed , everything .
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion .
I thought it was just like the movies , but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray , and a full circle of explosion .
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .
I went back to my bed , and I prayed , and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family &apos;s home , that it did not kill my family that night .
Thirty years have passed , and I still feel guilty about that prayer , for the next day , I learned that that missile landed on my brother &apos;s friend &apos;s home and killed him and his father , but did not kill his mother or his sister .
His mother showed up the next week at my brother &apos;s classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war , and nameless refugees , whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes , dirty face , scared eyes .
This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war , who we do not know their hopes , their dreams , their accomplishments , their families , their beliefs , their values .
This is my story .
I was that girl .
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war .
I am that refugee , and I am that girl .
You see , I grew up in war-torn Iraq , and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
We only talk about one side of it .
But there &apos;s another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it .
I grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood , the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile , so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it .
I grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire , the wrenching booms of explosions , ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens .
These are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
&quot; War , &quot; a friend of mine said , &quot; is not about sound at all .
It is actually about silence , the silence of humanity . &quot;
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars .
In my travels and in my work , from Congo to Afghanistan , from Sudan to Rwanda , I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same , but the fears of war are the same .
You know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid .
It is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; I am about to die &quot; or &quot; I could die in this explosion . &quot;
But there &apos;s also the fear of losing loved ones , and I think that &apos;s even worse .
It &apos;s too painful . You don &apos;t want to think about it .
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia , a Bosnian woman , once told me , who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo ; she said , &quot; The fear of losing the &apos; I &apos; in me , the fear of losing the &apos; I &apos; in me . &quot;
That &apos;s what my mother in Iraq used to tell me .
It &apos;s like dying from inside-out .
A Palestinian woman once told me , &quot; It is not about the fear of one death , &quot; she said , &quot; sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day , &quot; as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets .
She said , &quot; But it &apos;s not fair , because there is only one life , and there should only be one death . &quot;
We have been only seeing one side of war .
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels , drawdown timelines , surges and sting operations , when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn , where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going .
We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and casualties .
This is the language of sterility .
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic .
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities .
Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children . Oh .
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children .
How interesting .
Oh , half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days .
Or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated .
How interesting .
These just become numbers that we refer to .
The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space , guiding missiles toward unseen targets , while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist .
It is a chess game .
You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership .
Checkmate .
We are missing a completely other side of wars .
We are missing my mother &apos;s story , who made sure with every siren , with every raid , with every cut off-of electricity , she played puppet shows for my brothers and I , so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions .
We are missing the story of Fareeda , a music teacher , a piano teacher , in Sarajevo , who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school , despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her , and kept the piano , the violin , the cello playing the whole duration of the war , with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats .
That was her fight .
That was her resistance .
We are missing the story of Nehia , a Palestinian woman in Gaza who , the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year &apos;s war , she left out of home , collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have , in case there is no cease-fire the day after .
We are missing the stories of Violet , who , despite surviving genocide in the church massacre , she kept on going on , burying bodies , cleaning homes , cleaning the streets .
We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars .
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going ?
And the ones who are keeping that life are women .
There are two sides of war .
There is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
There is a side that is focused on winning battles , and there is a side that is focused on winning life .
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion , and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion .
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs .
There is a side that is led by men , and there is a side that is led by women .
And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace , we must understand war and peace from both sides .
We must have a full picture of what that means .
In order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one Sudanese woman once told me , &quot; Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again . &quot;
She grew up in Sudan , in Southern Sudan , for 20 years of war , where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees .
Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers , as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers .
So that woman walked for 20 years , so she would not be kidnapped again .
And only when there was some sort of peace , her toenails grew back again .
We need to understand peace from a toenail &apos;s perspective .
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table .
I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping , and the group of people who are mostly -- though not exclusively -- who are keeping life going in the midst of war , are not included in the negotiating table .
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion , but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion .
The doctors who are not fighting , the artists , the students , the men who refuse to pick up the guns , they are , too , excluded from the negotiating tables .
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace , building of democracy , sustainable economies , any kind of stabilities , if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table .
Not one , but 50 percent .
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don &apos;t start investing in women and girls .
Did you know that one year of the world &apos;s military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women ?
If we just reverse that distribution of funds , perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world .
And last , but not least , we need to invest in peace and women , not only because it is the right thing to do , not only because it is the right thing to do , for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today , but it is for the future .
A Congolese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now .
She got into Women for Women International &apos;s program .
She got a support network .
She learned about her rights .
We taught her vocational and business skills . We helped her get a job .
She was earning 450 dollars . She was doing okay .
She was sending them to school . Have a new home .
She said , &quot; But what I worry about the most is not any of that .
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts , and when they want to grow up , they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother . &quot;
We need to invest in women , because that &apos;s our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future .
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do .
Are there good news ? Of course , there are good news . There are lots of good news .
To start with , these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day , and if they can , who are we not to dance ?
That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people , sent 80 million dollars , and I started this from zero , nothing , nada , &#91; unclear &#93; .
They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances , not because of it .
Think of how the world can be a much better place if , for a change , we have a better equality , we have equality , we have a representation and we understand war , both from the front-line and the back-line discussion .
Rumi , a 13th-century Sufi poet , says , &quot; Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings , there is a field .
I will meet you there .
When the soul lies down in that grass , the world is too full to talk about .
Ideas , language , even the phrase &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot;
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
Let us make this field a much bigger place .
Let us all meet in that field .
Thank you .
The big residual is always value for money .
All the time we are trying to get value for money .
What we don &apos;t look for is value for many , while we are generating value for money .
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day , the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?
What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many ?
We have described here in terms of the performance and the price .
If you have money , of course , you can get the value .
You can get a Mercedes for a very high price , very high performance .
But if you don &apos;t have money , what happens ?
Well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
Well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lower-middle-class .
And if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters .
But the challenge is , again , they don &apos;t get much value , because they can &apos;t afford anything more than the scooter .
The issue is , at that price , can you give them some extra value ?
A super value , in terms of their ability to ride in a car , to get that dignity , to get that safety , looks practically impossible , isn &apos;t it .
Now , this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time .
But many people see the same thing and think things differently , and one of them is here , Ratan Tata .
The great thing about our leaders is that , should they not only have passion in their belly , which practically all of them have , they &apos;re also very innovative .
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done .
They believe that things can be done .
But great leaders like Ratan have compassion .
And what you said , Lakshmi , is absolutely true : it &apos;s not just Ratan Tata , it &apos;s the house of Tatas over time .
Let me confirm what she said .
Yes , I went barefoot until I was 12 .
I struggled to &#91; unclear &#93; day was a huge issue .
And when I finished my SSC , the eleventh standard , I stood eleventh among 125,000 students .
But I was about to leave the school , because my poor mother couldn &apos;t afford schooling .
And it was &#91; unclear &#93; Tata Trust , which gave me six rupees per month , almost a dollar per month for six years .
That &apos;s how I &apos;m standing before you .
So that is the House of Tata .
Innovation , compassion and passion .
They combine all that .
And it was that compassion which bothered them , because when he saw -- in fact , he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain , a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant .
And then he said , &quot; Well , I must give them a car that they can afford , one lakh car , $ 2,000 car . &quot;
Of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by Suzuki .
He said , oh , probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney .
And you can see the cartoon here .
Well they didn &apos;t build that . They built a proper car . Nano .
And mind you , I &apos;m six feet half an inch , Ratan is taller than me , and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car .
And incredible car .
And of course , nothing succeeds like success ; the cynics then turned around , and one after the other they also started saying , &quot; Yes , we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment .
We &apos;ll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment . &quot;
How did this great story unfold , the making of Nano ?
Let me tell you a bit about it .
For example , how we started : Ratan just began with a five-engineer team , young people in their mid-twenties .
And he said , &quot; Well , I won &apos;t define the vehicle for you , but I will define the cost for you .
It is one lakh , 100,000 rupees , and you are to make it within that . &quot;
And he told them , &quot; Question the unquestionable .
Stretch the envelope . &quot;
And at a point in time , he got so engrossed in the whole challenge , that he himself became a member of the team .
Can you believe it ?
I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated .
Until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
Early morning he &apos;ll be coming back with sort of solutions .
But who was the team leader ?
The team leader was Girish Wagh , a 34 year-old boy in &#91; unclear &#93; .
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years .
And they did innovation in design and beyond .
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
For example , that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft .
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
There was a co-creation , a huge co-creation , with vendors and suppliers .
All ideas on board were welcome .
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant , and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed .
Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth , for example , will be selling Nano .
I mean , it was incredible innovation .
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors .
It was an open innovation , ideas from all over were welcome .
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used , by the way , as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers .
The fuel lines and lamps were as in two-wheelers .
And the crux of the matter was , however , getting more from less .
All the time , you have been given an envelope .
You can &apos;t cross that envelope , which is 100,000 rupees , 2,000 dollars .
And therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
And the seat riser , for example , serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity .
Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car .
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
But the current entry-level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less , but 21 percent more inside space .
And what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less .
When the Model T was launched -- and this is , by the way , all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices -- Model T was 19,700 by Ford .
Volkswagon was 11,333 .
And British Motor was around 11,000 .
And Nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift , where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car , who were carrying their entire family in a scooter , started dreaming of being in a car .
And those dreams are getting fulfilled .
This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home .
The driver &apos;s name is Naran .
He has bought his own Nano .
And you can see , there is a physical space that has been created for him , parking that car , along with the owner &apos;s car , but more importantly , they &apos;ve created a space in their mind that &quot; Yes , my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I call it a transformational innovation .
It is not just technological , it is social innovation that we talk about .
And that is where , ladies and gentlemen , this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important .
I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia , about one and a half years ago , when their academy honored me with a fellowship .
And unbelievably , in 40 years , I was the first Indian to be honored .
And the title of my talk was therefore &quot; Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering . &quot;
And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering .
And Gandhian engineering , in my judgment , is the one which is going to take the world forward , is going to make a difference , not just for a few , but for everyone .
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs .
Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
What is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
And of course , these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not the case in India .
You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land , sometimes in a marshy land , and so on and so forth .
More importantly , they not only walk far to work , and not only do they cycle to work , but they cycle for work , as you can see here .
And they climb up for their work .
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
A challenge , of course .
Four billion people , their incomes are less then two dollars a day .
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe , you &apos;re talking about 10,000 days of income .
You just don &apos;t have it .
And therefore , you ought to look at alternatives .
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India .
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system , a quick molding and modular components , enabling custom-made , on-the-spot limb fitments .
You could feel it actually in an hour , by the way , whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day , as so on .
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes , rather than using heated sheets .
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks , &#91; unclear &#93; and functions .
And I like to show how it looks and how it works .
See , he jumps . You can see what stress it must have .
( Text : ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this .
... above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
&quot; Did it hurt ? &quot;
&quot; No ... not at all . &quot;
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ... ) One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds .
So that &apos;s what it is all about .
And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot , basically .
An incredible story .
Let &apos;s move on to something else .
I &apos;ve been talking about getting more from less for more .
Let &apos;s move to health .
We &apos;ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
What &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
You know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now , what has happened ?
10 years ago , it used to cost about a quarter billion .
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars .
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace , after all the human and animal testing , was 10 years , now it is 15 years .
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money ?
No , I &apos;m sorry .
We used to have 40 , now they have come down to 30 .
So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people .
Why less and less people ? Because it is so expensive , so very few will be able to basically afford that .
Let us just take an example .
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
The cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin , by the way , and 20 of them .
Time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
Let &apos;s start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets .
For example , we don &apos;t want 20,000 dollars ; we don &apos;t have it .
Can we do it &#91; for &#93; 100 dollars ?
Time for development , not 10 years .
We are in a hurry . Five years .
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars .
Sorry . I can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
Looks absolutely audacious .
Looks absolutely ridiculous .
You know something ? This has been achieved in India .
These targets have been achieved in India .
And how they have been achieved ...
Sir Francis Bacon once said , &quot; When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before , it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before . &quot;
And therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mice , into men , are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge , however , scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men , not molecule to mice to men , you know .
And that is how this difference has come .
And you can see this blending of traditional medicine , modern medicine , modern science .
I launched a big program &#91; unclear &#93; CSIR about nine years ago .
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis , for cancer and a whole range of things , changing the whole paradigm .
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of &#91; unclear &#93; by doing things differently .
You can see before treatment and after treatment .
This is really getting more from less for more and more people , because these are all affordable treatments now .
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said .
He had said , &quot; Earth provides enough to satisfy every man &apos;s need , but not every man &apos;s greed . &quot;
So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people , not only the current generation , but the future generations .
And he also said , &quot; I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . &quot;
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people , not just a few people .
And therefore , ladies and gentlemen , this is the theme , getting more from less for more .
And mind you , it is not getting just a little more for just a little less .
It &apos;s not about low cost .
It &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
You cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor I &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
Sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . You have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
Is it possible ? It has been made possible , by the way , for certain other different reasons .
So you are not talking about low cost , you are talking about ultra-low cost .
You are not talking about affordability , you are talking about extreme affordability .
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day .
You &apos;re not talking exclusive innovation .
You &apos;re talking about inclusive innovation .
And therefore , you &apos;re not talking about incremental innovation , you &apos;re talking about disruptive innovation .
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .
And I would also add , it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people , the whole world working for it .
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day .
You know , incubators for infants , for example .
They &apos;re not available in Africa .
They &apos;re not available in Indian villages .
And infants die .
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
And there &apos;s a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created .
And by whom ?
By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had , basically .
Their heart is in the right place , like Ratan Tata .
It &apos;s not just innovation , compassion and passion -- compassion in the heart and passion in the belly .
That &apos;s the new world that we want to create .
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering .
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;d like to end before time .
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
I &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
The message , the final message , is this : India gave a great gift to the world .
What was that ?
&#91; In the &#93; 20th century , we gave Gandhi to the world .
The 21st century gift , which is very , very important for the whole world , whether it is global economic meltdown , whether it is climate change -- any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more -- not only the current generations , for the future generations .
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering .
So ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m very happy to announce , this gift of the 21st century to the world from India , Gandhian engineering .
Lakshmi Pratury : Thank you , Dr. Mashelkar .
LP : A quick question for you .
Now , when you were a young boy in this school , what were your thoughts , like what did you think you could become ?
What do you think that drove you ?
Was there a vision you had ? What is it that drove you ?
RAM : I &apos;ll tell you a story that drove me , that transformed my life .
I remember , I went to a poor school , because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees , that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time .
It was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
But it was a poor school with rich teachers , honestly .
And one of them was &#91; unclear &#93; who taught us physics .
One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
The lens was here . The piece of paper was there . He moved it up and down .
And there was a bright spot up there .
And then he said , &quot; This is the focal length . &quot;
But then he held it for a little while , Lakshmi .
And then the paper burned .
When the paper burned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &quot; Mashelkar , like this , if you do not diffuse your energies , if you focus your energies , you can achieve anything in the world . &quot;
That gave me a great message : focus and you can achieve .
I said , &quot; Whoa , science is so wonderful , I have to become a scientist . &quot;
But more importantly , focus and you can achieve .
And that message , very frankly , is valuable for society today .
What does that focal length do ?
It has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
What does that convex lens do ?
It makes them meet .
This is convex lens leadership .
You know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? Concave length .
They divide them farther .
So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that .
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory &#91; unclear &#93; .
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research -- 40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other , I would &#91; unclear &#93; .
And currently I &apos;m president of Global Research Alliance , 60,000 scientists in nine counties , right from India to the U.S.
I &apos;m trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
That was the lesson . That was the inspirational moment .
LP : Thank you very much .
The question today is not : Why did we invade Afghanistan ?
The question is : why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later ?
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict ?
How has this happened ?
The last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair .
We faced Rwanda ; we faced Bosnia , and then we rediscovered our confidence .
In the third act , we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed .
In the fourth act , with our hubris , our overconfidence developing , we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan , and in the fifth act , we plunged into a humiliating mess .
So the question is : What are we doing ?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan ?
And the answer , of course , that we keep being given is as follows : we &apos;re told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9 / 11 , and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security .
In the words of President Obama , &quot; If the Taliban take over again , they will invite back Al-Qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
The story that we &apos;re told is that there was a &quot; light footprint &quot; initially -- in other words , that we ended up in a situation where we didn &apos;t have enough troops , we didn &apos;t have enough resources , that Afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn &apos;t enough progress and economic development and security , and therefore the Taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments , but we still didn &apos;t put enough troops on the ground .
And that it wasn &apos;t until 2009 , when President Obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of Secretary Clinton , &quot; the strategy , the leadership and the resources . &quot;
So , as the president now reassures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
All of this is wrong .
Every one of those statements is wrong .
Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &apos;d be able to seize Kabul .
They simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
And even if they were able to do so , even if I &apos;m wrong , it &apos;s extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda .
From the Taliban &apos;s point of view , that was their number one mistake last time .
If they hadn &apos;t invited back Al-Qaeda , they would still be in power today .
And even if I &apos;m wrong about those two things , even if they were able to take back the country , even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda , it &apos;s extremely unlikely that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe .
Because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the Taliban to protect them .
Furthermore , it &apos;s simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint .
In my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
And these troops that we brought in -- it &apos;s a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub-machine gun -- made the situation worse , not better .
When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 , what I saw was scenes like this .
A girl , if you &apos;re lucky , in the corner of a dark room -- lucky to be able to look at the Koran .
But in those early days when we &apos;re told we didn &apos;t have enough troops and enough resources , we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan .
Within a few months , there were two and a half million more girls in school .
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .
Today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
There was amazing improvements .
We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million Afghans had mobile telephones .
And we had progress in the free media .
We had progress in elections -- all of this with the so-called light footprint .
But when we began to bring more money , when we began to invest more resources , things got worse , not better . How ?
Well first see , if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year , you drown everything .
It &apos;s not simply corruption and waste that you create ; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government , the elected Afghan government , with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities .
And the same is true for the troops .
When I walked across Afghanistan , I stayed with people like this .
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
He was very generous , like many of the Afghans I stayed with .
But he was also considerably more conservative , considerably more anti-foreign , considerably more Islamist than we &apos;d like to acknowledge .
This man , for example , Mullah Mustafa , tried to shoot me .
And the reason I &apos;m looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened , and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him , having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house , why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .
But 18 months later , I asked him why he had tried to shoot me .
And Mullah Mustafa -- he &apos;s the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn &apos;t hit me .
Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa .
It &apos;s not ; it &apos;s a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
But it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it .
2005 , Anthony Fitzherbert , an agricultural engineer , could travel through Helmand , could stay in Nad Ali , Sangin and Ghoresh , which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place .
Today , he could never do that .
So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken .
Rather than preceding the insurgency , the Taliban followed the troop deployment , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , the troop deployment caused their return .
Now is this a new idea ?
No , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years .
I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010 , and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently , who &apos;ve traveled to almost every district in the country .
Andrew Wilder , for example , born on the Pakistan-Iranian border , served his whole life in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for Save the Children , ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit .
These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure , not more secure -- that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work .
And yet , nobody listened to them .
Instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
Beginning in 2004 , every general came in saying , &quot; I &apos;ve inherited a dismal situation , but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy , which will deliver , &quot; in General Barno &apos;s word in 2004 , the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
Well guess what ? It didn &apos;t .
But it wasn &apos;t sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver , in 2005 , the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
Or General David Richards to come in 2006 and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the &quot; crunch year . &quot;
Or in 2007 , the Norwegian deputy foreign minister , Espen Eide , to say that that would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
Or in 2008 , Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
Or in 2009 , my great friend , General Stanley McChrystal , who said that he was &quot; knee-deep in the decisive year . &quot;
Or in 2010 , the U.K. foreign secretary , David Miliband , who said that at last we would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
And you &apos;ll be delighted to hear in 2011 , today , that Guido Westerwelle , the German foreign minister , assures us that we are in the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
How do we allow any of this to happen ?
Well the answer , of course , is , if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country , you co-opt almost everybody .
Even the aid agencies , who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the U.S. and the European governments to build schools and clinics , are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that Afghanistan is an existential threat to global security .
They &apos;re worried , in other words , that if anybody believes that it wasn &apos;t such a threat -- Oxfam , Save the Children wouldn &apos;t get the money to build their hospitals and schools .
It &apos;s also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest .
It &apos;s very difficult for a politician , because you &apos;re afraid that many lives have been lost in vain .
You feel deep , deep guilt .
You exaggerate your fears , and you &apos;re terrified about the humiliation of defeat .
What is the solution to this ?
Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple , or those other people , who are telling the truth , who know the country , who &apos;ve spent 30 years on the ground -- and most importantly of all , the missing component of this -- Afghans themselves , who understand what is going on .
We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
And this is very difficult to do because of our structures .
The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government .
Very , very sadly , our foreign services , the United Nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &apos;s going on .
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months ; Italian soldiers , on tours of four months ; the American military , on tours of 12 months .
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
When they go out , they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour .
In the British embassy in Afghanistan in 2008 , an embassy of 350 people , there were only three people who could speak Dari , the main language of Afghanistan , at a decent level .
And there was not a single Pashto speaker .
In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground , I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan .
So we need to change that institutional culture .
And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations .
Secondly , we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals .
We need to make sure that we &apos;re a little bit suspicious , that we understand that optimism is in the DNA of the military , that we don &apos;t respond to it with quite as much alacrity .
And thirdly , we need to have some humility .
We need to begin from the position that our knowledge , our power , our legitimacy is limited .
This doesn &apos;t mean that intervention around the world is a disaster .
It isn &apos;t .
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990s happened .
It &apos;s almost impossible to believe the progress we &apos;ve made since 1994 .
Refugee return , which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely , has largely happened .
A million properties have been returned .
Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down .
The national army has shrunk .
The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden .
This has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by Bosnians themselves .
But you need to look at context .
And this is what we &apos;ve lost in Afghanistan and Iraq .
You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
And finally , we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement .
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals .
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees .
But that slowness , that caution , the fact that President Clinton initially said that American troops would only be deployed for a year , turned out to be a strength , and it helped us to put our priorities right .
One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our priorities out of sync .
We &apos;re not matching our resources to our priorities .
Because if what we &apos;re interested in is terrorism , Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan .
If what we &apos;re interested in is regional stability , Egypt is far more important .
If what we &apos;re worried about is poverty and development , sub-Saharan Africa is far more important .
This doesn &apos;t mean that Afghanistan doesn &apos;t matter , but that it &apos;s one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage .
So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention , what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue .
Why mountain rescue ?
Because when people talk about intervention , they imagine that some scientific theory -- the Rand Corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population .
This is the wrong way of looking at it .
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue .
When you &apos;re doing mountain rescue , you don &apos;t take a doctorate in mountain rescue , you look for somebody who knows the terrain .
It &apos;s about context .
You understand that you can prepare , but the amount of preparation you can do is limited -- you can take some water , you can have a map , you can have a pack .
But what really matters is two kinds of problems -- problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn &apos;t anticipate , such as , for example , ice on a slope , but which you can get around , and problems which you couldn &apos;t anticipate and which you can &apos;t get around , like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather .
And the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain , in every temperature , at every period -- a guide who , above all , knows when to turn back , who doesn &apos;t press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them .
What we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities .
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option .
It makes failure invisible , inconceivable and inevitable .
And if we can resist this crazy slogan , we shall discover -- in Egypt , in Syria , in Libya , and anywhere else we go in the world -- that if we can often do much less than we pretend , we can do much more than we fear .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Rory , you mentioned Libya at the end .
Just briefly , what &apos;s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
Rory Stewart : Okay , I think Libya poses the classic problem .
The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white .
We imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
And we are always being tempted up to our neck .
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck .
What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution .
We should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi .
We could have done that .
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours because Gaddafi had no planes within 48 hours .
Instead of which , we &apos;ve allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change .
In doing so , we &apos;ve destroyed our credibility with the Security Council , which means it &apos;s very difficult to get a resolution on Syria , and we &apos;re setting ourselves up again for failure .
Once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
Rory , thank you very much .
RS : Thank you .
It can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
And it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what I &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that I think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
And those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
And I &apos;m going to start with this one : If momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
We know that , right ? We &apos;ve experienced that .
And if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
That &apos;s the theme of my talk .
And we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932 .
Cannery Row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
Rolf Bolin , who was a professor at the Hopkin &apos;s Marine Station where I work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
They say , &quot; You know what you smell ?
You smell money . &quot;
That pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
We made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages , and I want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
We see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
And that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; Save the ocean . Heal the ocean . &quot;
It &apos;s that pyramid .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very frightening things happen .
Pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like PCBs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
And they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators , and in so doing , they accumulate .
Now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d invent a little game .
We don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
It &apos;s the Styrofoam and chocolate game .
Imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts .
Can &apos;t do much with them : Put them in your pocket .
Suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too .
What &apos;ll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
There &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts .
And that &apos;s exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid : They accumulate into the top of it .
Now suppose , instead of Styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
Well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they &apos;re absorbed by us .
And that &apos;s the difference between a PCB and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
PCBs accumulate .
We have great examples of that , unfortunately .
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay , in Texas , in North Carolina .
They get into the food chain .
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton , and those PCBs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
Now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin .
And what &apos;s that ?
In mother &apos;s milk .
Here &apos;s a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay .
Adult males : a huge load .
Juveniles : a huge load .
Females after their first calf is already weaned : a lower load .
Those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring don &apos;t survive .
The death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
Now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
There &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
That top predator , of course , is us .
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo -- or is it ?
In fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
Some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
That &apos;s another story .
But some of them were not whale meat at all .
Even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
Some of them were dolphin liver . Some of them were dolphin blubber .
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs , dioxins and heavy metals .
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
That &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
We had these data a few years ago .
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA .
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; Well , I know this . This is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
And for the very first time in my scientific career , I broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan , and I &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in Japan that &apos;s labeled incorrectly , even though they &apos;re still selling whale meat , which I believe they shouldn &apos;t .
But at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
It isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
These women have toxic breast milk .
They cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
That means their immune systems are compromised .
It means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
And the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
We &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
That &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
There &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
The pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that &apos;s clogged .
And if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
We end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red tides , for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
We can also see blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
How many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
Why does that happen ?
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .
Often what jams us up is sewage .
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
Not very often . We wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .
We wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
They &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and I believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
It &apos;s not just a question of cleanliness ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
These vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
They can go into your skin and create skin infections .
This is a graph from NOAA &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
Surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
And if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
That means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
These same infections create harmful algal blooms .
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
Copepods are small crustaceans .
They &apos;re a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
So what do you do ?
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
Well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
You could call Joe the Plumber , for example .
And he could come in and fix the flow .
But in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .
Monterey is one of those .
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
In 1932 , that &apos;s the picture .
In 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
The canneries are gone . The pollution has abated .
But there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
And that pyramid in Monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever functioned for the last 150 years .
It didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
On the left there , Julia Platt , the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove .
At 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
In 1931 , she produced California &apos;s first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
Other people , like David Packard and Julie Packard , who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay , but other places around the world .
Well , I want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid , and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
It &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
And it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
Thank you very much .
Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk .
By studying those twinkling lights though , we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life .
In this image of the Tokyo skyline , I &apos;ve hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block , the Kepler Mission .
Can you see it ?
There we go .
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
In just over two years of operations , we &apos;ve found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars .
To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler .
When we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things .
For one thing , we can determine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star .
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sitting around a campfire : You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you &apos;re warm , but not so close that you &apos;re too toasty and you get burned .
However , there &apos;s more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
You &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that Sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
But you &apos;ll notice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has freckles .
These freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field .
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
And we can measure this very , very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects .
However , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes , we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun &apos;s magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well .
Just think , even when it &apos;s cloudy outside , these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time .
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation , the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation .
And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system .
I &apos;m showing here Venus , Earth and Mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
But really , every measurement it makes is precious , because it &apos;s teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe .
While it &apos;s Kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it &apos;s we , life , who are searching .
Thank you .
So I think data can actually make us more human .
We &apos;re collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we &apos;re living our lives , and it &apos;s enabling us to tell some amazing stories .
Recently , a wise media theorist Tweeted , &quot; The 19th century culture was defined by the novel , the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema , and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface . &quot;
And I believe this is going to prove true .
Our lives are being driven by data , and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories .
So I &apos;m going to show you a few of the projects that I &apos;ve been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems .
This is a project called Flight Patterns .
What you &apos;re looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a 24-hour period .
As you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
Followed by that , you see on the West coast planes moving across , the red-eye flights to the East coast .
And you &apos;ll see everybody waking up on the East coast , followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner .
Everybody &apos;s moving from the East coast to the West coast .
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner .
I think it &apos;s one thing to say there &apos;s 140,000 planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time , and it &apos;s another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows .
This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data , but I &apos;ve color-coded it by type , so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us .
And I started making these , and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there .
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes , and the blue are higher altitudes .
And you can zoom in . This is taking a look at Atlanta .
You can see this is a major shipping airport , and there &apos;s all kinds of activity there .
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer .
See again , the diversity .
And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
This is scrolling up the East coast .
You can see some of the chaos that &apos;s happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other .
So zooming back out real quick , we see , again , the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner .
Moving across to the West coast , you see San Francisco and Los Angeles -- big low-traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona .
And that &apos;s us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom .
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters , because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data .
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
And you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
And you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT .
This is visualizing international communications .
So it &apos;s how New York communicates with other international cities .
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition .
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset , so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT &amp; amp ; T &apos;s data and revealing itself .
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org.
And it &apos;s visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam .
So you &apos;re seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city , until we approach New Year &apos;s Eve , where everybody says , &quot; Happy New Year ! &quot;
So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city .
This is looking at another event . This is called Queen &apos;s Day .
So again , you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city .
And then you &apos;re going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before , which happens right here .
And then you can see people celebrating the next day .
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases .
So now on to something completely different .
Some of you may recognize this .
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen &apos;s mechanical chess playing machine .
And it &apos;s this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well , except for one thing : it &apos;s not a robot at all .
There &apos;s actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player .
This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy .
And it &apos;s based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people , but really difficult for computers .
So they made this web service and said , &quot; Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people . &quot;
The nerdy side of me thought , &quot; Wow , this is amazing .
I can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
And the other nerdy side of me thought , &quot; This is horrible . This is completely bizarre .
What does this mean for the future of mankind , where we &apos;re all plugged into this borg ? &quot;
I was probably being a little extreme .
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re just doing these little labors ?
So I created this drawing tool .
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;ll pay you two cents for your contribution . &quot;
And I started collecting sheep .
And I collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
Lots of sheep .
I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected , and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep .
You can &apos;t pick individual sheep , but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity .
And juxtaposed against this grid , you see actually , by rolling over each individual one , the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process .
I think there &apos;s something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to , this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing .
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid .
Kind of amazing what some people did .
So here &apos;s a few statistics from the project .
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour .
There were 662 rejected sheep that didn &apos;t meet &quot; sheep-like &quot; criteria and were thrown out of the flock .
The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes .
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project , or were unique IP addresses -- so about how many people contributed .
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this .
Which I was pretty surprised by .
I expected people to be wondering , &quot; Why did I draw a sheep ? &quot;
And I think it &apos;s a pretty valid question .
And there &apos;s a lot of reasons why I chose sheep .
Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts , the first to be selectively bred for production traits , the first animal to be cloned .
Obviously , we think of sheep as followers .
And there &apos;s this reference to &quot; Le Petit Prince &quot; where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep .
He draws sheep after sheep .
The narrator &apos;s only appeased when he draws a box .
And he says , &quot; It &apos;s not about a scientific rendering of a sheep .
It &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
And I like that .
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin &apos;s &quot; Modern Times . &quot;
It &apos;s showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution .
So there were no longer shoe makers , but now there are people slapping soles on people &apos;s shoes .
And the whole idea of one &apos;s relationship to their work changed a lot .
So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into 16 pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool .
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame , and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they &apos;re doing .
And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima .
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for , which is making money .
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces , and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk .
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw .
But here there was no sheep-like criteria .
People , if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face , it actually made it into the bill .
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do .
So we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project , which is now known as One Laptop Per Child .
This is again showing all the different contributions .
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings , like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions .
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing , &quot; $ 0.01 ! ! ! Really ? &quot;
That &apos;s all I &apos;m getting paid for this ?
So the last Mechanical Turk project I &apos;m going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for 2000 .
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey .
You may recognize these two guys .
This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the &apos; 60s , where they created the song &quot; Daisy Bell , &quot; which was the world &apos;s first singing computer .
You may recognize it from &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey . &quot;
When HAL &apos;s dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song , as a reference to when computers became human .
So we resynthesized this song .
This is what that sounded like .
We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing .
Daisy Bell : Daisy , Daisy ... Aaron Koblin : And we took all of those individual pieces , and we fed them into another Turk request .
This is what it would look like if you went to the site .
You type in your code , but you first test your mic .
You &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
And then you &apos;d do your best to recreate that with your own voice .
After previewing it and confirming it &apos;s what you submitted , you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context .
And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions .
Recording : Daisy , Daisy give me your answer do I &apos;m half crazy all for the love of you It can &apos;t be a stylish marriage I can &apos;t afford a carriage But you &apos;ll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two AK : So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative , distributed music making , where nobody has any idea what it is they &apos;re working on .
So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
Chorus : Daisy , Daisy Give me your answer do I &apos;m half crazy all for the love of you It can &apos;t be a stylish marriage I can &apos;t afford a carriage But you &apos;d look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two AK : So stepping back for a quick second , when I was at UCLA going to grad school , I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing .
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners .
So basically motion through 3D space .
And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said , &quot; Wait a minute .
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video ? &quot;
So we did exactly that .
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands , Radiohead .
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers , but we also open sourced it , and we made it released as a Google Code project , where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .
And people were making some amazing things .
This is actually two of my favorites : the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke .
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content .
More recently , somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke &apos;s head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on , I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something .
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk .
And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project .
But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months .
And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin , who was finishing up Johnny Cash &apos;s final album called &quot; Ain &apos;t No Grave . &quot;
The lyrics to the leading track are &quot; Ain &apos;t no grave can hold my body down . &quot;
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash .
So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello , also known as Mr. doob , who &apos;s a much better programmer than I am , and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool .
As you know , an animation is a series of images .
So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash , and at eight frames a second , we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video .
So I don &apos;t have time to play the entire thing for you , but I want to show you two short clips .
One is the beginning of the music video .
And that &apos;s going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly .
Johnny Cash : There ain &apos;t no grave can hold my body down There ain &apos;t no grave can hold body down When I hear the trumpet sound I &apos;m going to ride right out of the ground Ain &apos;t no grave can hold my body ... AK : What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs .
Collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
And I just thought it &apos;d be wonderful , it &apos;d be really nice to contribute something to his memory .
Collaborator Two : It really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
Collaborator Three : For all of the frames to be drawn by fans , each individual frame , it &apos;s got a very powerful feeling to it .
Collaborator Four : I &apos;ve seen everybody from Japan , Venezuela , to the States , to Knoxville , Tennessee .
Collaborator Five : As much as is different from frame to frame , it really is personal .
Collaborator Six : Watching the video in my room , I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
And I just worked and worked through problems , until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves .
You can actually see the point when I know what I &apos;m doing , and a lot of light and dark comes into it .
And in a weird way , that &apos;s what I actually like about Johnny Cash &apos;s music as well .
It &apos;s the sum total of his life , all the things that had happened -- the bad things , the good things .
You &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
AK : So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com , what you &apos;ll see is the video playing above .
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project .
So this isn &apos;t finished at all , but it &apos;s an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate .
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails , you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located .
And if you find one that you &apos;re interested in , you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you &apos;re able to rate that frame , which helps it bubble up to the top .
And you can also see the way that it was drawn .
Again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
In addition to that , it &apos;s listed , the artist &apos;s name , the location , how long they spent drawing it .
And you can pick a style . So this one was tagged &quot; Abstract . &quot;
But there &apos;s a bunch of different styles .
And you can sort the video a number of different ways .
You can say , &quot; I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version .
And then this is , again , the abstract version , which ends up getting a little bit crazy .
So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk .
And this is called &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot;
It &apos;s an online music video for the Arcade Fire .
Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers , where you have HTML5 audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast .
And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen .
But most importantly , I think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
What if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up .
And you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video specifically for you , pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself .
So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but I &apos;m going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
Win Butler : Now our lives are changing fast Now our lives are changing fast Hope that something pure can last Hope that something pure can last Ooh we used to wait Ooh we used to wait Ooh we used to wait Sometimes it never came Sometimes it never came Still moving through the pain We used to wait for it We used to wait for it We used to wait for it AK : So I think , if there &apos;s one thing to take away from my talk today , it &apos;s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device .
And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data , we have an opportunity , and maybe even an obligation , to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together .
Thanks a lot .
I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
You know the incident .
Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked .
They freak out .
And the rest is history .
Nowadays , Adam and Eve would probably act differently .
&#91; @ Adam Last nite was a blast ! loved dat apple LOL &#93; &#91; @ Eve yep .. babe , know what happened to my pants tho ? &#93; We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before , and so much information about us is being collected by organizations .
Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
And my story is about these tradeoffs .
We start with an observation which , in my mind , has become clearer and clearer in the past few years , that any personal information can become sensitive information .
Back in the year 2000 , about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide , but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online .
In 2010 , only on Facebook , in a single month , 2.5 billion photos were uploaded , most of them identified .
In the same span of time , computers &apos; ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
What happens when you combine these technologies together : increasing availability of facial data ; improving facial recognizing ability by computers ; but also cloud computing , which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies ; and ubiquitous computing , which allows my phone , which is not a supercomputer , to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds ?
Well , we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity .
To test that , we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus .
We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a webcam , and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop .
While they were filling out the survey , we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster , and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles .
By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey , the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found , and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo .
Do you see the subject ?
Well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
So essentially , we can start from an anonymous face , offline or online , and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data .
But a few years back , we did something else .
We started from social media data , we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security , and we ended up predicting social security numbers , which in the United States are extremely sensitive information .
Do you see where I &apos;m going with this ?
So if you combine the two studies together , then the question becomes , can you start from a face and , using facial recognition , find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person , and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information , much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face ?
And the answer is , yes , we can , and we did .
Of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
&#91; 27 % of subjects &apos; first 5 SSN digits identified &#93; But in fact , we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone &apos;s internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time : looking for a match , finding public information , trying to infer sensitive information , and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject , an example of augmented reality , probably a creepy example of augmented reality .
In fact , we didn &apos;t develop the app to make it available , just as a proof of concept .
In fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme .
Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or , one day , their contact lenses , and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you .
What will this future without secrets look like ?
And should we care ?
We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases , but in fact , having so much information doesn &apos;t mean that we will make decisions which are more objective .
In another experiment , we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate .
We included in this information some references to some funny , absolutely legal , but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online .
Now interestingly , among our subjects , some had posted comparable information , and some had not .
Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject ?
Paradoxically , it was the group who had posted similar information , an example of moral dissonance .
Now you may be thinking , this does not apply to me , because I have nothing to hide .
But in fact , privacy is not about having something negative to hide .
Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization , and you receive résumés , and you decide to find more information about the candidates .
Therefore , you Google their names and in a certain universe , you find this information .
Or in a parallel universe , you find this information .
Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview ?
If you think so , then you are not like the U.S. employers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that .
We created Facebook profiles , manipulating traits , then we started sending out résumés to companies in the U.S. , and we detected , we monitored , whether they were searching for our candidates , and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media . And they were .
Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates .
Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor .
But think again . Why should that be always the case ?
In a movie which came out a few years ago , &quot; Minority Report , &quot; a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him .
Now , that movie is set in 2054 , about 40 years from now , and as exciting as that technology looks , it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you , and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect .
So as an example , this is another experiment actually we are running , not yet completed .
Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends , and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most .
And then they create , in real time , a facial composite of these two friends .
Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don &apos;t recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites , but they react to those composites in a positive manner .
So next time you are looking for a certain product , and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it , it will not be just a standard spokesperson .
It will be one of your friends , and you will not even know that this is happening .
Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight .
One of these mechanisms is transparency , telling people what you are going to do with their data .
And in principle , that &apos;s a very good thing .
It &apos;s necessary , but it is not sufficient .
Transparency can be misdirected .
You can tell people what you are going to do , and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information .
So in yet another experiment , this one with students , we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior , including pretty sensitive questions , such as this one .
&#91; Have you ever cheated in an exam ? &#93; Now to one group of subjects , we told them , &quot; Only other students will see your answers . &quot;
To another group of subjects , we told them , &quot; Students and faculty will see your answers . &quot;
Transparency . Notification . And sure enough , this worked , in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second .
It makes sense , right ?
But then we added the misdirection .
We repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers ?
Ten minutes ?
Five minutes ?
One minute ?
How about 15 seconds ?
Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information , as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers .
Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy , but that is not my point .
In fact , I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives .
The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done , and certainly not the best way they can be done .
When someone tells you , &quot; People don &apos;t care about privacy , &quot; consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy , and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself .
When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data , consider that in the last 20 years , researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner .
We can browse the Internet anonymously .
We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient , not even the NSA .
We can have even privacy-preserving data mining .
In other words , we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy .
Of course , these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don &apos;t hear more about them .
Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden .
There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn &apos;t have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed .
You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton &apos;s &quot; Paradise Lost . &quot;
In the garden , Adam and Eve are materially content .
They &apos;re happy . They are satisfied .
However , they also lack knowledge and self-awareness .
The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge , that &apos;s when they discover themselves .
They become aware . They achieve autonomy .
The price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
So privacy , in a way , is both the means and the price to pay for freedom .
Again , marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them , but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us .
We get free content .
We get to play Angry Birds . We get targeted apps .
But in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort .
Even more so than George Orwell , the author is , of course , Aldous Huxley .
In &quot; Brave New World , &quot; he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us .
However , in the book , he also offers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden .
In the words of the Savage , regaining autonomy and freedom is possible , although the price to pay is steep .
So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
Right now , many of us do not even know that the fight is going on , but it is , whether you like it or not .
And at the risk of playing the serpent , I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here , the awareness of what is going on , and in your hands , just a few clicks away .
Thank you .
So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does .
We stand in elections ; we vote in elections ; we observe elections .
Our democracies rely on elections .
We all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
We cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us , to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
Well unfortunately , power corrupts , and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power , including doing bad things to elections .
You see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
Whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry -- a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these procedures around the election .
So for example , you come to the polling station , and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote .
When you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
Well , what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that , after you drop your vote into the ballot box .
And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted , because they trust that the election system works .
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
They &apos;re unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted .
Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
Well in the face of all these bad headlines , researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently .
They &apos;ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture .
And the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly , without breaking election secrecy , which is so very important .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ?
Well , the way we &apos;ve come up with uses computers but doesn &apos;t depend on them .
And the secret is the ballot form .
And if you look closely at these ballot forms , you &apos;ll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one .
And that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , I won &apos;t be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right .
And there &apos;s some complicated cryptography going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us , and then we &apos;ll use the paper for verification .
So this is how you vote .
You get one of these ballot forms at random , and then you go into the voting booth , and you mark your choices , and you tear along a perforation .
And you shred the candidate list .
And the bit that remains , the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote .
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
And because it &apos;s encrypted , it can be submitted , stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see , including you .
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
And after the close of the election , you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website .
And remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
If the government wants to find out how you voted , they won &apos;t be able to .
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted .
No hacker can break in and change your vote , because then it won &apos;t match your receipt .
Votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
Instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly .
They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one .
And these are elections by the people , for the people .
So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections .
Thank you .
Thank you very much , Chris . Everybody who came up here said they were scared . I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this .
And I don &apos;t have any smart technology for you to look at .
There are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa .
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters .
While it is true that those things are going on , there &apos;s an Africa that you don &apos;t hear about very much .
And sometimes I &apos;m puzzled , and I ask myself why .
This is the Africa that is changing , that Chris alluded to .
This is the Africa of opportunity .
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies .
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this . That &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa .
On 15th of September 2005 , Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha , a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria , was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London .
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family .
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people : Mr. Nuhu Ribadu .
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London .
Due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . But what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .
Today , Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail .
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders .
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll benefit just a few of the elite .
And therefore , when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries , and that some successes are emerging .
Does it mean the problem is over ? The answer is no .
There &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there .
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight .
So when you hear about corruption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can &apos;t operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption . That is not the case .
There &apos;s a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . In others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go .
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
The results are showing : independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving .
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries .
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance .
That is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa .
That &apos;s the image : African countries . But let me say this : if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries &apos; monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they &apos;re able to do this , what is that ? Is that not corruption ?
In this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
So when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money &apos;s going and what can be done to stop it .
I &apos;m working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries &apos; moneys -- to get that sent back .
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform .
Africans , after -- they &apos;re tired , we &apos;re tired of being the subject of everybody &apos;s charity and care .
We are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform .
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us . We have to do it .
We can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
We have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information .
And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , Nigeria .
In fact , if you &apos;re not in Nigeria , you &apos;re not in Africa .
I want to tell you that .
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian , and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people . You &apos;ll never be bored .
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
And with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
Not the International Monetary Fund . Not the World Bank , where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .
No one can do it for you . You have to do it for yourself .
We put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent .
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
We -- as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
You couldn &apos;t get it . You had to bribe .
You had to do everything to get your phone .
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines , and counting .
Nigeria &apos;s telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world , after China . We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms . And nobody knows , except a few smart people .
The smartest one , first to come in , was the MTN company of South Africa .
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country , with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita .
So the market is there .
When they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies , and three or four others have come in .
But there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know .
So privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
The other thing we &apos;ve also done is to manage our finances better .
Because nobody &apos;s going to help you and support you if you &apos;re not managing your own finances well .
And Nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well .
So what did we try to do ? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price .
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the biggest , most revenue-earning sector in the economy : 70 percent of our revenues come from oil .
We de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
We didn &apos;t know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
When they crashed , we crashed .
And we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
That smoothened out . We were able to save , just before I left , 27 billion dollars . Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves .
By the time I left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . And as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
And that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now .
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
And what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil .
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
As telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and I could go on and on . And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous .
We have opportunities in agriculture , like I said .
We have opportunities in solid minerals . We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored . And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible , that wouldn &apos;t happen . So we &apos;ve now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .
We have opportunities in housing and real estate .
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here .
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
And now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
So , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . Financial services : we had 89 banks . Too many not doing their real business .
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside .
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million .
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million .
And I can go on . Dollars , on and on , into the system .
We are doing the same with the insurance sector .
So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
In tourism , in many African countries , a great opportunity .
And that &apos;s what many people know East Africa for : the wildlife , the elephants , and so on .
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important .
So what am I trying to say ? I &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s a new wave on the continent .
A new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections .
Not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
I &apos;m trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum .
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
Conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible , of course , of which is Darfur .
And , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected .
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries , not one country .
And if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there &apos;s plenty of opportunity .
And I want to just make one point about this investment .
The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs .
There &apos;s no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children &apos;s lives . That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying . That is fine .
But imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? Isn &apos;t that the way to go ?
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women .
I have a CD here . I &apos;m sorry that I didn &apos;t say anything on time .
Otherwise , I would have liked you to have seen this .
It says , &quot; Africa : Open for Business . &quot;
And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year .
Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania , where they &apos;re having the session in June .
But it shows you Africans , and particularly African women , who against all odds have developed businesses , some of them world-class .
One of the women in this video , Adenike Ogunlesi , making children &apos;s clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business .
Mixing African materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere .
So , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with African material mixed in . Very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart .
For 10,000 pieces .
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
And the women are diligent . They are focused ; they work hard .
I could go on giving examples : Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda , who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her .
However , many of these are starved for capital to expand , because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary . Nobody thinks in terms of a market .
Nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
But I &apos;m standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever .
So if you want to be in Africa , think about investing .
Think about the Beatrices , think about the Adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
So I invite you to explore the opportunities .
When you go to Tanzania , listen carefully , because I &apos;m sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for yourselves .
Thank you very much .
I have , like , a thing about sleeping .
I don &apos;t sleep that much , and I &apos;ve come to this thing about , like , not sleeping much as being a great virtue , after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment , or something .
And now I really like sort of sitting up , you know .
But for years I &apos;ve been sitting up and I think that , like , my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia .
I lie awake . I think thoughts . I walk aimlessly .
Sometimes I used to walk more at night .
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting .
And sometimes -- actually , once it was on Page Six in the Post , that I was cruising this guy , like , sort of , whatever , but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on .
And so I was following this guy .
And I took a picture of his shoes , and we thanked each other and just went on our way .
But I do that all the time .
As a matter of fact , I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye .
Because I feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken , of course , or very , very surprising .
And often , I &apos;m driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I &apos;d never seen happen before .
And so I &apos;d make the car stop , and I &apos;d get out of the car and walk , and see that in fact there wasn &apos;t a hole , but it was a trick of my eye , it was a shadow , you know .
Or if there was a hole I &apos;d think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
Someone made that mistake already so I can &apos;t do it anymore .
I don &apos;t know where inspiration comes from .
It does not come for me from research .
I don &apos;t get necessarily inspired by research .
As a matter of fact , one of the most fun things I &apos;ve ever , ever done in my whole life , was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York .
I read &quot; Peter and the Wolf &quot; with this beautiful band from Juilliard .
And I did like , you know , the narrator , and I read it .
And I saw this really smart critic who I love .
This woman , Joan Acocella , who &apos;s a friend of mine , and she came backstage and she said , oh , you know , Isaac , did you know that , talking about Stalinism and talking about , you know , like the &apos; 30s in Russia .
And I said , how do I know about Stalinism ?
I know about a wolf and a bird and , you know , he ate the bird , and then in the end you hear , you know , you hear the bird squeaking , or something , you know ?
So I don &apos;t really know that . I don &apos;t really -- actually I do my own kind of research , you know .
If I &apos;m commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera , or something like that , I will do a lot of research , because it &apos;s interesting , not because it &apos;s what I &apos;m supposed to do .
I &apos;m very , very , very inspired by movies .
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the projection , or light from the projection , makes the colors look so impossible .
And anyway , roll this little clip , I &apos;ll just show you .
I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot .
And I think about , you know , their roles , and about how you have to , like , watch what your daughters look at .
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time .
Whether they &apos;re kind of glorified in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , ironically glorified , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated .
I go back to color all the time .
Color is something that motivates me a lot .
It &apos;s rarely color that I find in nature , although , you know , juxtaposed next to artificial color , natural color is so beautiful .
So that &apos;s what I do . I study color a lot .
But for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood ?
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
I mean , that &apos;s just not possible , you know .
And so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , I guess , you know .
I want to show you -- I &apos;m also like a big -- I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often , and that &apos;s another thing that motivates me a lot .
People say , oh , do that . An astrologer tells me to do something .
So I do it .
When I was about 21 , an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams , and that his name was going to be Eric , right ?
So , you know , for years I would go to bars and , sort of , anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately , or something .
And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like , &quot; Eric ! &quot;
And anybody who would turn around I would , sort of , make a beeline for .
And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago .
The last card he pulled , which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know , sort of spats and this , you know , a minstrel singer , right ?
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act .
So actually , check this out .
Very embarrassing .
: Thank you . We can do anything you ask .
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother .
It &apos;s sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers .
I was dating this guy , right ?
And this has to do with being happy , I swear .
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year , right .
And we were getting serious , so we decided to invite them all to dinner , our parents .
And we , you know , sort of introduced them to each other .
My mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .
You know , homosexuality , right ?
So my mother was a little offended . She turned to her and she said , &quot; Are you kidding ? They have the greatest life together .
They eat out , they see shows . &quot;
They eat out , they see shows .
That &apos;s the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that &apos;s on my tombstone when I die .
&quot; He ate out , he saw shows , &quot; right ?
So in editing these clips , I didn &apos;t have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe &apos;s Pub .
So you &apos;ll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something .
Because it &apos;s mortifying , and yet it feels ...
I don &apos;t know how to put this .
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing , you know .
And at least , you know , in my case , because if I just do one thing all the time , I don &apos;t know , I get very , very bored . I bore very easily .
And you know , I don &apos;t say that I do everything well , I just say that I do a lot of things , that &apos;s all .
And I kind of try not to look back , you know .
Except , I guess , that &apos;s what staying up every night is about .
Like , looking back and thinking , what a fool you made of yourself , you know .
But I guess that &apos;s okay . Right ?
Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything , and not just one , you know .
You don &apos;t master feeling lousy about one thing .
Yeah , exactly .
I will show you this next thing , speaking of costumes for operas .
I do work with different choreographers .
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot , and I work with Mark Morris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
And I designed three operas with him , and the most recent one , &quot; King Arthur . &quot;
I &apos;d been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager .
I went to performing arts high school , where I was an actor .
And many of my friends were ballet dancers .
Again , I don &apos;t know where inspiration comes from .
I don &apos;t know where it comes from .
I started making puppets when I was a kid .
Maybe that &apos;s where the whole inspiration thing started from , puppets , right .
And then performing arts high school .
There I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
And somehow , from there , I got interested in design .
I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer .
I don &apos;t really think of myself as a designer , I don &apos;t really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer .
And frankly , I don &apos;t really know what to call myself .
I think of myself as a ... I don &apos;t know what I think of myself as .
It &apos;s just that .
But I must say , this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time , that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer .
You always have to be slightly bored with everything .
And if you &apos;re not , you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything .
But I am really a little bored with everything .
I always say to my partner , Marisa Gardini , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .
And she makes all the deals .
And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
Too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that &apos;s so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio , like for a day show . Some kind of day talk show .
Because it &apos;s all of these things that I love all kind of in one place .
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
And so I had this T.V. show .
And that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
Actually , could you roll the clip , please ?
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie .
Isaac Mizrahi : We &apos;re back on the set .
Hi there .
Rosie O &apos;Donnell : Hello , Ben .
IM : Look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back .
Her grandmother says , &quot; Delish ! &quot;
IM : Ah , wow , delish . All right . So now where should I position myself ?
I want to stay out of the way .
I don &apos;t want to be -- okay . Here we go .
Do you get nervous , Ashleigh ?
Ashleigh : Doing what ?
ROD : Cutting hair .
Cutting hair ? Never , never .
I don &apos;t think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous .
IM : You look so cute already , by the way .
ROD : You like it ? All right .
IM : Do you have a problem with looking cute ? You want to look cute .
ROD : Of course I want to look cute .
IM : Just checking , because some people want to look , you know , aggressively ugly .
ROD : No , not me , no .
IM : You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow , like , really messed up , you know what I mean ?
And there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , Rosie .
Because just because if you &apos;re fabulously rich , and fabulously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting messed up ?
ROD : No , but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first , I think .
But you have to make the decision for yourself .
My kids are seven , who the hell knows .
They &apos;re going to be like 14 and in rehab .
And they &apos;re going to be playing this clip : &quot; I &apos;m such a good mother . &quot;
My God , this is the shortest I &apos;ve ever had .
IM : It looks good , yeah ?
I was going to ask you , has your hair ever been -- ROD : No ! It &apos;s all right -- go crazy .
IM : I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here .
Oh no , we &apos;re just staging , ROD : We &apos;re just staging it .
IM : Are you freaking out ? You look so cute .
ROD : No , I love it . It &apos;s the new me .
IM : Oh , it &apos;s so fabulous !
ROD : Flock of Rosie . Wooo !
IM : So by the way . Of all the most unboring things in the world , right .
I mean , like making someone who &apos;s already cute look terrible like that .
That is not boring . That is nothing if it &apos;s not boring .
Actually , I read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
Right ? And then I realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an interview .
I forgot that I said that . But it &apos;s really true .
I want to show you this last clip because it &apos;s going to be my last goodbye .
I &apos;ll tell you that I cook a lot also . I love to cook .
And I often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
Like I say , oh , you know , would you serve a rotten chicken ?
Then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dress or something .
How could you show a beat up old dress ?
I always relate things to kitchen-ry .
And so I think that &apos;s what it all boils down to .
Everything boils down to that .
So check this out .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing because I think it &apos;s the most fun thing in the world .
It &apos;s , like , this website .
It &apos;s got a lot of different things on it .
It &apos;s a polymathematical website .
We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments .
And it &apos;s kind of my favorite thing in the world .
And it just began like in the beginning of February . So who knows ?
And again , I don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , I just think it &apos;s not boring , right ?
And here is the last bit .
IM : I have to tell you , I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time .
Chef : Do you ?
IM : Yeah , but I can never find buttermilk , ever .
Chef : Oh .
IM : You can &apos;t find buttermilk at Citarella ; you can &apos;t find buttermilk .
Chef : You can &apos;t ?
IM : It &apos;s always low-fat buttermilk .
Chef : No , but that &apos;s all it is .
IM : Is that all it is ?
Chef : Oh , you don &apos;t know ? Let me tell you something .
Let me tell you something interesting .
IM : You know what ? Stop laughing . It &apos;s not funny .
Just because I don &apos;t know that whole -- that there &apos;s no such thing as whole buttermilk .
Sorry , what ?
Chef : Well , here &apos;s the deal . Let me tell you the deal .
In the old days when they used to make butter , you know how you make butter ?
IM : Churns ?
Chef : For cream ?
IM : Yeah , exactly .
Chef : So you take heavy , high-fat milk , which is cream , and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water .
The liquid is actually that clear liquid .
If you &apos;ve ever overbeaten your whipped cream , it &apos;s actually buttermilk .
And that &apos;s what it was in the early days .
And that &apos;s what people used for baking and all sorts of things .
Now , the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk .
IM : Excuse me , I didn &apos;t know . All right ?
Chef : The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious .
IM : Yeah , it is , exactly .
So who would think that it was low-fat ?
Well , that &apos;s it . Thank you very much .
Happy TED . It &apos;s so wonderful here . I love it . I love it . I love it .
Thanks . Bye .
I &apos;m a gamer , so I like to have goals .
I like special missions and secret objectives .
So here &apos;s my special mission for this talk : I &apos;m going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes .
Literally , you will live seven and half minutes longer than you would have otherwise , just because you watched this talk .
Okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
That &apos;s okay , because check it out -- I have math to prove that it is possible .
And it won &apos;t make a lot of sense now .
I &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if I &apos;m successful in my mission .
Now , you have a secret mission too .
Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
And I think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . You weren &apos;t going to have them anyway .
Now , because I &apos;m a game designer , you might be thinking to yourself , I know what she wants us to do with those minutes , she wants us to spend them playing games .
Now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .
For example , in my first TEDTalk , I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
Now , 21 billion hours , it &apos;s a lot of time .
It &apos;s so much time , in fact , that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk , is this : Jane , games are great and all , but on your deathbed , are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds ?
This idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that I hear it literally everywhere I go .
For example , true story : Just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developer &apos;s conference , turned around and said -- and I quote -- &quot; I hate games . Waste of life . Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time . &quot;
Now , I want to take this problem seriously .
I mean , I want games to be a force for good in the world .
I don &apos;t want gamers to regret the time they spent playing , time that I encouraged them to spend .
So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately .
When we &apos;re on our deathbeds , will we regret the time we spent playing games ?
Now , this may surprise you , but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question .
It &apos;s true . Hospice workers , the people who take care of us at the end of our lives , recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds .
And that &apos;s what I want to share with you today -- the top five regrets of the dying .
Number one : I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
Number two : I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends .
Number three : I wish I had let myself be happier .
Number four : I wish I &apos;d had the courage to express my true self .
And number five : I wish I &apos;d lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me .
Now , as far as I know , no one ever told one of the hospice workers , I wish I &apos;d spent more time playing video games , but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying , I can &apos;t help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill .
For example , I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
For many people , this means , I wish I &apos;d spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up .
Well , we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits .
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-life relationships with them .
I wish I &apos;d stayed in touch with my friends .
Well , hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family .
A recent study from &#91; University of Michigan &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools .
They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren &apos;t playing games together .
I wish I &apos;d let myself be happier .
Well , here I can &apos;t help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression .
Just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness .
I wish I &apos;d had the courage to express my true self .
Well , avatars are a way to express our true selves , our most heroic , idealized version of who we might become .
You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar .
And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals .
I wish I &apos;d led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me .
Are games doing this yet ? I &apos;m not sure , so I &apos;ve left a question mark , a Super Mario question mark .
And we &apos;re going to come back to this one .
But in the mean time , perhaps you &apos;re wondering , who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets ?
And it &apos;s true , I &apos;ve never worked in a hospice , I &apos;ve never been on my deathbed .
But recently I did spend three months in bed , wanting to die .
Really wanting to die .
Now let me tell you that story .
It started two years ago , when I hit my head and got a concussion .
Now the concussion didn &apos;t heal properly , and after 30 days I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , I had to rest it .
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
For me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine .
In other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
Of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .
It happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
My brain started telling me , Jane , you want to die .
It said , you &apos;re never going to get better .
It said , the pain will never end .
And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life , which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days -- and I will never forget this moment -- I said , I am either going to kill myself or I &apos;m going to turn this into a game .
Now , why a game ?
I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challenges with more creativity , more determination , more optimism , and we &apos;re more likely to reach out to others for help .
And I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge , so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer .
Now this became my new secret identity , and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister -- I have an identical twin sister named Kelly -- and tell her , I &apos;m playing a game to heal my brain , and I want you to play with me .
This was an easier way to ask for help .
She became my first ally in the game , my husband Kiyash joined next , and together we identified and battled the bad guys .
Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process , things like bright lights and crowded spaces .
We also collected and activated power-ups .
This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good , just a little bit productive .
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
Now the game was that simple : Adopt a secret identity , recruit your allies , battle the bad guys , activate the power-ups .
But even with a game so simple , within just a couple days of starting to play , that fog of depression and anxiety went away . It just vanished . It felt like a miracle .
Now it wasn &apos;t a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms .
That lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
But even when I still had the symptoms , even while I was still in pain , I stopped suffering .
Now what happened next with the game surprised me .
I put up some blog posts and videos online , explaining how to play .
But not everybody has a concussion , obviously , not everyone wants to be &quot; the slayer , &quot; so I renamed the game SuperBetter .
And soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity , recruiting their own allies , and they were getting &quot; super better &quot; facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain , depression and Crohn &apos;s disease .
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS .
And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me .
They talked about feeling stronger and braver .
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family .
And they even talked about feeling happier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives .
Now at the time , I &apos;m thinking to myself , what is going on here ?
I mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases life-and-death , circumstances ?
I mean , if it hadn &apos;t worked for me , there &apos;s no way I would have believed it was possible .
Well , it turns out there &apos;s some science here too .
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event .
And that &apos;s what was happening to us .
The game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder .
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn &apos;t doom us to suffer indefinitely .
Instead , we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives .
Here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say : My priorities have changed . I &apos;m not afraid to do what makes me happy .
I feel closer to my friends and family .
I understand myself better . I know who I really am now .
I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life .
I &apos;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams .
Now , does this sound familiar ?
It should , because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying .
Now this is interesting , right ?
It seems that somehow , a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets .
But how does it work ?
How do you get from trauma to growth ?
Or better yet , is there a way to get all the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma , without having to hit your head in the first place ?
That would be good , right ?
I wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so I devoured the scientific literature , and here &apos;s what I learned .
There are four kinds of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience , and you don &apos;t need a trauma to do it .
Now , I could tell you what these four types of strength are , but I &apos;d rather you experience them firsthand .
I &apos;d rather we all start building them up together right now .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
This is where you earn those seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier .
All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests .
And I feel like you can do it . I have confidence in you .
So , everybody ready ? This is your first quest . Here we go .
Pick one : Stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . Go !
All right , I like the people doing both . You are overachievers .
Very good .
Well done , everyone . Now that is worth plus-one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .
Now we know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still .
That &apos;s all it takes .
Every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
Everybody ready for your next quest ?
I want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times , or count backwards from 100 by seven , like this : 100 , 93 ...
Go !
Don &apos;t give up .
Don &apos;t let the people counting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50 .
Nice . Wow . That &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever seen that .
Bonus physical resilience . Well done , everyone .
Now that &apos;s worth plus-one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower .
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle .
It gets stronger the more you exercise it .
So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower .
So good job . Quest number three .
Pick one : Now because of the room we &apos;re in , fate &apos;s really determined this for you , but here are the two options .
If you &apos;re inside , find a window and look out of it .
If you &apos;re outside , find a window and look in .
Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for &quot; baby &#91; your favorite animal . &#93; &quot; Now , you could do this on your phones , or you could just shout out some baby animals , I &apos;m going to find some and put them on the screen for us .
So , what do we want to see ?
Sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . Okay , let &apos;s see what we got .
Baby dolphin and baby llamas . Everybody look .
Got that ?
Okay , one more . Baby elephant .
We &apos;re clapping for that ?
That &apos;s amazing .
All right , now what we &apos;re just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience , which means you have the ability to provoke powerful , positive emotions like curiosity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most .
And here &apos;s a secret from the scientific literature for you .
If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour , a day , a week , you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
It &apos;s my favorite SuperBetter trick , so keep it up .
All right , pick one , last quest : Shake someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , Facebook or Twitter . Go !
Looking good , looking good .
Nice , nice .
Keep it up . I love it !
All right , everybody , that is plus-one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community .
Now , a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude .
Touch is even better .
Here &apos;s one more secret for you : Shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other .
This will linger during the break , so take advantage of the networking opportunities .
Okay , well you have successfully completed your four quests , so let &apos;s see if I &apos;ve successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life .
And here &apos;s where I get to share one more little bit of science with you .
It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else .
So this is true .
If you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio , if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time , if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day , if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower , you will live 10 years longer than everyone else , and here &apos;s where that math I showed you earlier comes in .
So , the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years , but we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies that you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting your four types of resilience .
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience , you &apos;re actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life , or 67,298 more minutes of life , which means every single day , you are earning 184 minutes of life , or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience , like we just did together , you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life .
Congratulations , those seven and a half minutes are all yours . You totally earned them .
Yeah ! Awesome .
Wait , wait , wait .
You still have your special mission , your secret mission .
How are you going to spend these seven and a half minutes of bonus life ?
Well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie &apos;s wishes .
You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes .
Pretty clever , right ?
So , if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy , or that gets you physically active , or puts you in touch with someone you care about , or even just tackling a tiny challenge , you are going to boost your resilience , so you &apos;re going to earn more minutes .
And the good news is , you can keep going like that .
Every hour of the day , every day of your life , all the way to your deathbed , which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise .
And when you get there , more than likely , you will not have any of those top five regrets , because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams .
And with 10 extra years , you might even have enough time to play a few more games .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people , which we will hope to see happen .
We discussed , in the prior film , some of the old things that we did , like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic .
And I &apos;d like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people .
At the present time , it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient , before that patient arrives at an emergency room .
And people with silent ischemia -- which , translated into English , means they don &apos;t have any symptoms -- it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital .
The AMI , Acute Myocardial Infarction , which is a doctor &apos;s big word so they can charge you more money -- -- means a heart attack . Annual incidence : 1.2 million Americans .
Mortality : 300,000 people dying each year .
About half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .
Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
Symptoms are often denied by the patient , particularly us men , because we are very brave . We are very brave , and we don &apos;t want to admit that I &apos;m having a hell of a chest pain .
Then , approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms .
What are we going to do about them ? How can we save their lives ?
It &apos;s particularly true of diabetics and elderly women .
Well , what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?
A means to determine if there &apos;s a complete blockage of a coronary artery .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is a heart attack .
The means consist of noting something a little technical , ST segment elevation of the electrogram -- translated into English , that means that if there &apos;s an electrical signal in the heart , and one part of the ECG -- which we call the ST segment -- elevates , that is a sure sign of a heart attack .
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who &apos;s at risk , we could know , before they even have symptoms , that they &apos;re having a heart attack , to save their life .
Well , the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm , vibration like your cell phone , but right by your clavicle bone .
And when it goes beep , beep , beep , you better do something about it , because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment .
So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won &apos;t just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be pigs .
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin , like you see in an emergency room , and I &apos;m going to show you why they don &apos;t work very well .
And then we put a lead , which is a wire , in the right ventricle inside the heart , which does the electrogram , which is the signal voltage from inside the heart .
Well , with the pig , at the baseline , before we blocked the pig &apos;s artery to simulate a heart attack , that was the signal .
After 43 seconds , even an expert couldn &apos;t tell the difference , and after three minutes -- well , if you really studied it , you &apos;d see a difference .
But what happened when we looked inside the pig &apos;s heart , to the electrogram ?
There was the baseline -- first of all , a much bigger and more reliable signal .
Second of all , I &apos;ll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference , and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line .
Look at the difference there . It doesn &apos;t take much -- every layperson could see that difference , and computers can be programmed to easily detect it .
Then , look at that after three minutes .
We see that the signal that &apos;s actually in the heart , we can use it to tell people that they &apos;re having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life .
Then we tried it with my son , Dr. Tim Fischell , we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in .
Well , he kept the balloon filled to block the artery , to simulate a blockage , which is what a heart attack is .
And it &apos;s not hard to see that -- the baseline is the first picture on the upper left .
Next to it , at 30 seconds , you see this rise here , then this rise -- that &apos;s the ST elevation .
And if we had a computer that could detect it , we could tell you you &apos;re having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure .
And then he did it again . We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see , even after 10 seconds , a great rise in this piece , which we can have computers inside , under your chest like a pacemaker , with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker .
And computers don &apos;t go to sleep .
We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement .
What does the system look like ?
Well , on the left is the IMD , which is Implantable Medical Device , and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they &apos;ve exhibited it .
It &apos;s about this big , the size of a pacemaker .
It &apos;s implanted with very conventional techniques .
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table .
It &apos;ll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because , if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re in deep doo-doo .
And then , finally , a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation , which is the level which says you are having a heart attack .
The FDA says , OK , test this final device after it &apos;s built in some animal , which we said is a pig , so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack .
And when you go to the farmyard , you can &apos;t easily get pigs to have heart attacks , so we said , well , we &apos;re experts in stents .
Tonight you &apos;ll see some of our invented stents .
We said , so we &apos;ll put in a stent , but we &apos;re not going to put in a stent that we &apos;d put in people .
We &apos;re putting in a copper stent , and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks .
That &apos;s not very nice , but , after all , we had to find out what the answer is .
So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig , and let me show you the result that &apos;s very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned .
So there it was , Thursday morning we stopped the pig &apos;s medication and there is his electrogram , the signal from inside the pig &apos;s heart coming out by radio telemetry .
Then , on Friday at 6 : 43 , he began to get certain signs , which later we had the pig run around -- I &apos;m not going to go into this early stage .
But look what happened at 10 : 06 after we removed this pig &apos;s medication that kept him from having a heart attack .
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation . Can you see it there ?
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation ?
This pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
What happens after you have the heart attack , this blockage ?
Your rhythm becomes irregular , and that &apos;s what happened 45 minutes later .
Then , ventricular fibrillation , the heart quivers instead of beats -- this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died ; it went flat-line .
But we had a little bit over an hour where we could &apos;ve saved this pig &apos;s life .
Well , because of the FDA , we didn &apos;t save the pig &apos;s life , because we need to do this type of animal research for humans .
But when it comes to the sake of a human , we can save their life .
We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack .
What is the response to acute myocardial infarction , a heart attack , today ?
Well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
It &apos;s not all that bad ; you decide not to do anything .
Several hours pass and it gets worse , and even the man won &apos;t ignore it .
Finally , you go to the emergency room .
You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated , because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don &apos;t have AMI , so you &apos;re not taken very seriously .
They finally see you . It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it , and it &apos;s hard to do because they don &apos;t have the baseline data , which the computer we put in you gets .
Finally , if you &apos;re lucky , you are treated in three or four hours after the incident , but the heart muscle has died .
And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa -- that &apos;s the typical treatment in the advanced world today .
So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient , called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian .
And when you have a blockage , the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device , which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm , so you can take it to the emergency room and show them , and say , take care of me right away .
Then it goes to a network operations center , where they get your data from your patient database that &apos;s been put in at some central location , say , in the United States .
Then it goes to a diagnostic center , and within one minute of your heart attack , your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is .
And the person who &apos;s there , the medical practitioner , calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says , &quot; Mr. Smith , you &apos;re in deep doo-doo ; you have a problem .
We &apos;ve called the ambulance . The ambulance is on the way .
It &apos;ll pick you up , and then we &apos;re going to call your doctor , tell him about it .
We &apos;re going to send him the signal that we have , that says you have a heart attack , and we &apos;re going to send the signal to the hospital and we &apos;re going to have it analyzed there , and there you &apos;re going to be with your doctor and you &apos;ll be taken care of so you won &apos;t die of a heart attack . &quot;
That &apos;s the first invention that I wanted to describe .
And now I want to talk about something entirely different .
At first I didn &apos;t think migraine headaches were a big problem because I &apos;d never had a migraine headache , but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life , and their lives are being totally ruined by it .
We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine , which is , &quot; Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe , controlled magnetic pulse applied , as needed , by the patient . &quot;
Now , you &apos;re probably very few physicists here .
If you &apos;re a physicist you &apos;d know there &apos;s a certain Faraday &apos;s Law , which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water -- that &apos;s your brains by the way -- it &apos;ll generate electric currents , and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache .
That &apos;s what we have discovered .
So here &apos;s a picture of what we &apos;re doing .
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons -- that &apos;s shown in red -- that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain .
And when it hits the mid-brain , that &apos;s when the headache begins .
There &apos;s this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura , and this visual aura , by the way -- and I &apos;ll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights , gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .
And what we tried was this ; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10 .
Weighs about 70 pounds , has a wire about an inch in diameter .
And here &apos;s one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache , bad one , after the aura . What do we do ?
This is what an aura looks like .
It &apos;s sort of funny dancing lights , shown there on the left and right side .
And that &apos;s a fully developed visual aura , as we see on top .
In the middle , our experimentalist , the neurologist , who said , &quot; I &apos;m going to move this down a little and I &apos;m going to erase half your aura . &quot;
And , by God , the neurologist did erase it , and that &apos;s the middle picture : half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse .
What does that mean ?
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that &apos;s interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain .
And finally he says , &quot; OK , now I &apos;m going to -- &quot; all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse .
What is the result ? We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this , that you could have -- a lady , in her pocket book -- and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works .
Well , the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News , Channel 7 , last week in New York City , in the 11 o &apos;clock news .
Anchor : For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches -- and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight : a possible answer .
Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight , with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away .
Christina Sidebottom : Well , my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like , and it was very strange .
Stacy Sager : But for Christina Sidebottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine .
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse , but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper , say it is scientifically sound -- that , in fact , when the average person gets a migraine , it &apos;s caused by something similar to an electrical impulse .
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that .
Yousef Mohammed : In other words , we &apos;re treating electricity with electricity , rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we &apos;re using nowadays .
SS : But is it safe to use everyday ?
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade , and more long-term studies need to be done . Christina now swears by it .
CS : It &apos;s been the most wonderful thing for my migraine .
SS : Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer .
Robert Fischell : And that is the invention to treat migraines .
You see , the problem is , 30 million Americans have migraine headaches , and we need a means to treat it , and I think that we now have it .
And this is the first device that we did , and I &apos;m going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
Our conclusions from our studies so far , at three research centers , is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once .
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times , and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches , not only those with aura , get treated and get diminished .
And auras can be erased and the migraine , then , does not occur .
And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
The third and last invention began with an idea .
Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation .
Now , why do we use -- add on , nearly , an epileptic focus ?
Now , unfortunately , us technical people , unlike Mr. Bono , have to get into all these technical words .
Well , &quot; responsive electrical stimulation &quot; means that we sense , at a place in your brain which is called an &quot; epileptic focus , &quot; which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there , that it &apos;s going to happen , and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot , which erases the errant signal so that you don &apos;t get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that &apos;s used for the heart .
We thought we could adapt it for the brain .
The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage , which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around .
Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy , as well as other diseases of the brain , because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it , that causes many , if not all , of brain disorders .
We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation , and this is a picture of what the device looked like , that &apos;s placed into the cranial bone .
This is probably a better picture .
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame .
There &apos;s a cut made in the scalp ; it &apos;s opened ; the neurosurgeon has a template ; he marks it around , and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device .
And tonight , you &apos;ll be able to see the device in the tent .
And then with four screws , we put in a frame , then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes , to the epileptic focus , the origin of the epilepsy , where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure .
In the blue wire , we see what &apos;s called a deep brain electrode .
If that &apos;s the source of the epilepsy , we can attack that as well .
The comprehensive solution : this is the device ; it &apos;s about one inches by two inches and , oddly enough , just the thickness of most cranial bones .
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation : It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur , provide stimulation only when needed , can be turned off if seizures disappear ; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact , in all our clinical trials to date , we &apos;ve seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it &apos;s been implanted -- and it &apos;s invisible , cosmetically hidden , so , if you have epilepsy and you have the device , no one will know it because you can &apos;t tell that it &apos;s there .
And this shows what an electroencephalogram is , and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients .
Then we stimulated , and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal , which means they did not get the epileptic seizure .
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy , which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon .
I have three wishes . Well , I can &apos;t do much about Africa .
I &apos;m a tech ; I &apos;m into medical gadgetry , which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about .
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator , called RNS , for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that &apos;s a brilliant acronym -- for the treatment of other brain disorders .
Well , if we &apos;re going to do it for epilepsy , why the hell not try it for something else ?
Then you saw what that device looked like , that the woman was using to fix her migraines ?
I tell you this : that &apos;s something which some research engineer like me would concoct , not a real designer of good equipment .
We want to have some people , who really know how to do this , perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations .
Then we &apos;re going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA , where we have problems that Africa doesn &apos;t have .
And by reducing malpractice litigation -- malpractice litigation is not an African problem ; it &apos;s an American problem .
So , to get quickly to my first wish -- the brain operates by electrical signals .
If the electrical signals create a brain disorder , electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain &apos;s neurons .
In other words , if you &apos;ve screwed up electrical signals , maybe , by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain , we can counteract that .
A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation like we &apos;re doing with epilepsy .
But even if there is no signal , electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder .
And consider treating psychotic disorders -- and I want this involved with the TED group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that , presently , is not well treated with drugs , and includes five million Americans .
And Mr. Fischer , and his group at NeuroPace , and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world .
That is the first wish .
The second wish is , at the present time , the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators -- that &apos;s what TMS means , device to treat migraine headaches -- appears to be quite successful .
Well , that &apos;s the good news .
The present portable device is far from optimally designed , both as to human factors as appearance .
I think she said it looks like a gun . A lot of people don &apos;t like guns .
Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device And that is the second wish .
And , of the 100,000-dollar prize money , that TED was so generous to give me , I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD , obsessive-compulsive disorder , and I &apos;m making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines .
And that &apos;s how I &apos;ll use my 100,000-dollar prize money .
Well , the third and final wish is somewhat -- unfortunately , it &apos;s much more complicated because it involves lawyers .
Well , medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance , so that competent physicians are leaving their practice .
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury , because this patient really ended up badly .
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs .
I &apos;ve seen pictures , graphs in today &apos;s USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control , and this is one factor .
Well , how can the TED community help with this situation ?
I have a couple of ideas to begin with .
As a starting point for discussion with the TED group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
For example , I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent .
Would you believe , 12 pages , single space , the patient has to read before they &apos;re in our trial to cure their epilepsy ?
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages ?
They don &apos;t understand what the hell it &apos;s about .
That &apos;s the present system . How about making a video ?
We have entertainment people here ; we have people who know how to do videos , with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation .
Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they &apos;re being videoed and they press , do you understand this ? No , I don &apos;t .
Well , then let &apos;s go to a simpler explanation .
Then there &apos;s a simpler one and , oh yes , I understand that .
Well , press the button and you &apos;re on record , you understand .
And that is one of the ideas .
Now , also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter , with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done , including all the possible failure modes .
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs .
Now , in America , in fact , you cannot give up your right to trial by jury .
However , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it &apos;ll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it won &apos;t be nearly as good a case .
If a medical error occurs , the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court .
That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
These are just some starting points .
And , so there , that &apos;s the end of all my wishes .
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I &apos;ve got and there they are .
The public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result , the architectural object .
Is the latest tower in London a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool ?
So recently , we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects , maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of tell stories about architecture .
And we discovered that we didn &apos;t have to invent it , it already existed in the form of a comic book .
So we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes , how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation .
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world .
We call this comic book &quot; Yes is More , &quot; which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes .
In this case it &apos;s Mies van der Rohe &apos;s Less is More .
He triggered the modernist revolution .
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution , Robert Venturi saying , &quot; Less is a bore . &quot;
After him , Philip Johnson sort of introduced you could say promiscuity , or at least openness to new ideas with , &quot; I am a whore . &quot;
Recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
And what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; Yes is More &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined , as who or what we are against .
The cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment .
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius , frustrated that the world doesn &apos;t fit in with his or her ideas .
Rather than revolution , we &apos;re much more interested in evolution , this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world .
In fact , I actually think that Darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process .
His famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
As you can see , a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings .
At each meeting , there &apos;s way too many ideas .
Only the best ones can survive .
And through a process of architectural selection , we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model .
We mate them . They have sort of mutant offspring .
And through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design .
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen .
The design process was really tough , almost like a struggle for survival , but gradually an idea evolved : this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city , sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome , but sort of public on the outside , as well as on the inside , with the library .
But Darwin doesn &apos;t only explain the evolution of a single idea .
As you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
It doesn &apos;t really work in this context .
But for another client in another culture , it could really be the right answer to a different question .
So as a result , we never throw anything out .
We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity .
You never know when you might need it .
And what I &apos;d like to do now , in an act of warp-speed storytelling , is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world .
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010 .
And we saw this guy , Haibao .
He &apos;s the mascot of the expo , and he looks strangely familiar .
In fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of Sweden .
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme , but it didn &apos;t exactly look like something from the north of Sweden .
The Swedish jury didn &apos;t think so either . So we lost .
But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman who saw our design and said , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the Chinese character for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; So , apparently this is how you write &quot; people , &quot; as in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
We even double checked .
And at the same time , we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week .
So we thought like , this is too much of an opportunity , so we hired a feng shui master .
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions , and went to China .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .
This is our two interpreters , sort of reading the architecture .
It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper , which got Mr. Liangyu Chen , the mayor of Shanghai , to visit the exhibition .
And we had the chance to explain the project .
And he said , &quot; Shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
And with the People &apos;s Building , he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China .
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him .
Unfortunately , Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption .
But like I said , Haibao looked very familiar , because he is actually the Chinese character for &quot; people . &quot;
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is &quot; Better City , Better Life . &quot;
Sustainability .
And we thought , sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo-Protestant idea that it has to hurt in order to do good .
You know , you &apos;re not supposed to take long , warm showers .
You &apos;re not supposed to fly on holidays because it &apos;s bad for the environment .
Gradually , you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life .
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life .
We also asked ourselves , what could Denmark possibly show China that would be relevant ?
You know , it &apos;s one of the biggest countries in the world , one of the smallest .
China symbolized by the dragon .
Denmark , we have a national bird , the swan .
China has many great poets , but we discovered that in the People &apos;s Republic public school curriculum , they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng , or Hans Christian Anderson , as we call him .
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with &quot; The Emperor &apos;s New Clothes , &quot; &quot; The Matchstick Girl &quot; and &quot; The Little Mermaid . &quot;
It &apos;s almost like a fragment of Danish culture integrated into Chinese culture .
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall .
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon .
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid .
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
Copenhagen , Shanghai , modern , European .
But then we looked at recent urban development , and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street , 30 years ago . All bikes , no cars .
This is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
Bicycles have become forbidden many places .
Meanwhile , in Copenhagen we &apos;re actually expanding the bicycle lanes .
A third of all the people commute by bike .
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike that you can borrow if you visit the city .
So we thought , why don &apos;t we reintroduce the bicycle in China ?
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai .
So if you come to the expo , go straight to the Danish pavilion , get a Danish bike , and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .
Like I said , Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities , but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it .
One of the first projects we ever did was the harbor bath in Copenhagen , sort of continuing the public realm into the water .
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda , images , statements , but no real experience .
So just like with a bike , we don &apos;t talk about it .
You can try it .
Like with the water , instead of talking about it , we &apos;re going to sail a million liters of harbor water from Copenhagen to Shanghai , so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is .
This is where people normally object that it doesn &apos;t sound very sustainable to sail water from Copenhagen to China .
But in fact , the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark , and then they sail empty back .
So quite often you load water for ballast .
So we can actually hitch a ride for free .
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath , we &apos;re actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid .
So the real Mermaid , the real water , and the real bikes .
And when she &apos;s gone , we &apos;re going to invite a Chinese artist to reinterpret her .
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes .
When you go to the exhibition , you &apos;ll see the Mermaid and the pool .
You &apos;ll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo .
So when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project .
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship .
The first thing , the China map missed Taiwan .
It &apos;s a very serious political issue in China . We will add on .
The second thing , we had compared the swan to the dragon , and then the Chinese state said , &quot; Suggest change to panda . &quot;
So , when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument , the National People &apos;s Party sort of rebelled against it .
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid .
So for the first time , I got invited to speak at the National Parliament .
It was kind of interesting because in the morning , from 9 to 11 , they were discussing the bailout package -- how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy .
And then at 11 o &apos;clock they stopped talking about these little issues .
And then from 11 to 1 , they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China .
But to conclude , if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year , don &apos;t come to Copenhagen , because she &apos;s going to be in Shanghai .
If you do come to Copenhagen , you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei , the Chinese artist .
But if the Chinese government intervenes , it might even be a panda .
So the second story that I &apos;d like to tell is , actually starts in my own house .
This is my apartment .
This is the view from my apartment , over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony .
And they form this sort of vertical backyard where , on a nice summer day , you &apos;ll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of 10 meters .
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
Trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views , instead of into each other .
Until recently , this was the view from my apartment , onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site .
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure .
And we thought , rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars , why don &apos;t we turn all the apartments into penthouses , put them on a podium of cars .
And because Copenhagen is completely flat , if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view , you basically have to do it yourself .
Then we sort of cut up the volume , so we wouldn &apos;t block the view from my apartment .
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments .
And up in the sun , you have a single layer of apartments that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle , like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view , and a sort of dense urban location .
This is our first architectural model .
This is an aerial photo taken last summer .
And essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator .
It &apos;s actually a stand-up product from Switzerland , because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators .
And the facade of the parking , we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated , so we needed to perforate it .
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes , we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic , naturally ventilated , rasterized image .
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain , we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest , making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork .
So if you go back into the parking , into the corridors , it &apos;s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south-facing urban oasis .
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades .
If you go even further , it turns into this green garden .
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain is actually accumulated .
And there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a Cambodian temple ruin , completely covered in green .
So , the Mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy .
This idea that you can actually create , if not gold , then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients , like normal apartments and normal parking , and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don &apos;t have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city .
They can actually have both .
As an architect , it &apos;s really hard to set the agenda .
You can &apos;t just say that now I &apos;d like to do a sustainable city in central Asia , because that &apos;s not really how you get commissions .
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen , and the sort of turmoil of the world .
One last example is that recently we , like last summer , we won the competition to design a Nordic national bank .
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling .
It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity .
Unfortunately , it was the national bank of Iceland .
At the same time , we actually had a visitor -- a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office .
We took him to see the Mountain . And he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture , because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia .
So he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan .
So we took the commission .
And we made this small movie that I &apos;d like to show .
We quite often make little movies .
We always argue a lot about the soundtrack , but in this case it was really easy to choose the song .
So basically , Baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of Zira , the island that we are planning -- almost like the diagram of their flag .
And our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of Azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures , inhabitable of human life .
Then we place these mountains on the island , surrounding this sort of central green valley , almost like a central park .
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . It has no vegetation .
It has no water . It has no energy , no resources .
So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem , exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants , and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings .
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape , gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green , lush landscape .
So , you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature , in this case it &apos;s actually creating nature .
And the buildings , they don &apos;t only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains , they also operate like mountains .
They create shelter from the wind .
They accumulate the solar energy .
They accumulate the water .
So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem .
So we recently presented the master plan , and it has gotten approved .
And this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains , in what &apos;s going to be the first carbon-neutral island in Central Asia .
Yes , maybe just to round off .
So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan .
With a little luck and some more evolution , maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going around the world giving talks about Darwin , and usually what I &apos;m talking about is Darwin &apos;s strange inversion of reasoning .
Now that title , that phrase , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that I just love , and would like to read for you .
&quot; In the theory with which we have to deal , Absolute Ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it .
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express , in condensed form , the essential purport of the Theory , and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin &apos;s meaning ; who , by a strange inversion of reasoning , seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill . &quot;
Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion .
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it : &quot; Test Two : Do you know of any building that didn &apos;t have a builder ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any painting that didn &apos;t have a painter ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any car that didn &apos;t have a maker ? Yes / No .
If you answered &apos; Yes &apos; for any of the above , give details . &quot;
A-ha ! I mean , it really is a strange inversion of reasoning .
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
But Darwin shows that it &apos;s just false .
Today , though , I &apos;m going to talk about Darwin &apos;s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they &apos;re so cute .
And , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny .
This is all backwards . It is . And Darwin shows us why .
Let &apos;s start with sweet . Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector , because sugar is high energy , and it &apos;s just been wired up to the preferer , to put it very crudely , and that &apos;s why we like sugar .
Honey is sweet because we like it , not &quot; we like it because honey is sweet . &quot;
There &apos;s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn &apos;t see why they tasted sweet .
You have to look in our brains to understand why they &apos;re sweet .
So if you think first there was sweetness , and then we evolved to like sweetness , you &apos;ve got it backwards ; that &apos;s just wrong . It &apos;s the other way round .
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
And it &apos;s a good thing that there isn &apos;t , because if there were , then Mother Nature would have a problem : How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
Now you might think , ah , there &apos;s a solution : hallucinations .
That would be one way of doing it , but there &apos;s a quicker way .
Just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do .
That &apos;s all there is to it .
Over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
We became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn &apos;t .
If we hadn &apos;t , then probably this would be the height of sexiness .
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food .
It wasn &apos;t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen , who did his famous experiments with gulls , where he found that that orange spot on the gull &apos;s beak -- if he made a bigger , oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder .
It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
What we see with , say , chocolate cake is it &apos;s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
And there &apos;s even supernormal stimuli for cuteness . Here &apos;s a pretty good example .
It &apos;s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers .
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do .
And , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby .
So nature works on many levels here .
But now , if babies didn &apos;t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this , that &apos;s what we would find adorable , that &apos;s what we would find -- we would think , oh my goodness , do I ever want to hug that .
This is the strange inversion .
Well now , finally what about funny . My answer is , it &apos;s the same story , the same story .
This is the hard one , the one that isn &apos;t obvious . That &apos;s why I leave it to the end .
And I won &apos;t be able to say too much about it .
But you have to think evolutionarily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done -- it &apos;s dirty work , somebody &apos;s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful , inbuilt reward for it when we succeed .
Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues .
It &apos;s a neural system that &apos;s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
Now I &apos;m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I &apos;ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward .
And what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off , by turning the knob on a joke -- now it &apos;s not funny ... oh , now it &apos;s funnier ...
now we &apos;ll turn a little bit more ... now it &apos;s not funny -- in this way , we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain , the functional architecture of the brain .
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this . We call it the Hurley Model .
He &apos;s a computer scientist , Reginald Adams a psychologist , and there I am , and we &apos;re putting this together into a book .
Thank you very much .
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit , and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature .
And so , I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation , that is , looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
And so one of the questions that I asked you is , when you look around , what do you see ?
Well , you see this space that &apos;s created by designers and by the work of people , but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here , being reshaped in a certain form .
And so the question is : how did that material get here ?
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped , and so forth ?
It &apos;s a question of what &apos;s the continuity ?
So one of the things I look at is , how did the universe begin and shape ?
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials ?
So that &apos;s sort of the part , and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field .
If you look at this picture , what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it .
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars , and you can see them there -- little pluses .
This is a star , this is a star , everything else is a galaxy , OK ?
So there &apos;s a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here .
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy , which looks a lot like ours , I wonder if there &apos;s an art design college conference going on , and intelligent beings there are thinking about , you know , what designs they might do , and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from , and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what &apos;s going on over here .
But there &apos;s a lot of other galaxies , and some are nearby , and they &apos;re kind of the color of the Sun , and some are further away and they &apos;re a little bluer , and so forth .
But one of the questions is -- this should be , to you -- how come there are so many galaxies ?
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky .
This is only 1,000 galaxies .
We think there &apos;s on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope , if you had the time to scan it around -- about 100 billion galaxies . Right ?
It &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
And that &apos;s roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy .
But when you look at some of these regions like this , you &apos;ll see more galaxies than stars , which is kind of a conundrum .
So the question should come to your mind is , what kind of design , you know , what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that ?
And then I &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
We &apos;re going to try and follow it up .
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study , and that &apos;s the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it &apos;s a time machine , in a certain sense .
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres , just because that &apos;s where we &apos;re making observations .
And the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it &apos;s the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
Two seconds is like the present .
The Sun is eight minutes ago . That &apos;s not such a big deal , right , unless there &apos;s solar flares coming then you want to get out the way .
You &apos;d like to have a little advance warning .
But you get out to Jupiter and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . It &apos;s a problem .
You hear about Mars , it &apos;s a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there .
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars , to the nearest 40 or 50 stars , it &apos;s about 10 years .
So if you take a picture of what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s 10 years ago .
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy , it &apos;s thousands of years ago .
If you look at Andromeda , which is the nearest big galaxy , and it &apos;s two million years ago .
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago , there &apos;d be no evidence of humans at all , because we don &apos;t think there were humans yet .
I mean , it just gives you the scale .
With the Hubble Space Telescope , we &apos;re looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years .
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further -- there &apos;s some things even further , and that was what I did in a lot of my work , was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies , back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different .
And so that &apos;s the sort of sequence , and so I have a more artistic impression of this .
There &apos;s the galaxy in the middle , which is the Milky Way , and around that are the Hubble -- you know , nearby kind of galaxies , and there &apos;s a sphere that marks the different times .
And behind that are some more modern galaxies .
You see the whole big picture ?
The beginning of time is funny -- it &apos;s on the outside , right ?
And then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so dense and so hot , light can &apos;t escape .
It &apos;s like you can &apos;t see to the center of the Sun ; you have to use other techniques to know what &apos;s going on inside the Sun .
But you can see the edge of the Sun , and the universe gets that way , and you can see that .
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside , and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang , which is actually incredibly uniform .
The universe is almost a perfect sphere , but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration .
And from them in the time sequence we &apos;re going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
So it &apos;s a big design job , but we &apos;ll see about how things are going on .
So the way these measurements were done , there &apos;s been a set of satellites , and this is where you get to see .
So there was the COBE satellite , which was launched in 1989 , and we discovered these variations .
And then in 2000 , the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP -- and it made somewhat better pictures .
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version , the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it , and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched , and it will make very high-resolution maps .
And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe .
And what we saw was , we saw these variations , and then they told us the secrets , both about the structure of space-time , and about the contents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original motions .
So we have this picture , which is quite a spectacular picture , and I &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning .
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion , and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent , then to the Dark Ages , and then the first stars turn on , and they evolve into galaxies , and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming .
And it &apos;s maturing up to the present time .
And there &apos;s some spectacular things .
And this wastebasket part , that &apos;s to represent what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period .
And so this is a pretty weird model , right ?
What kind of evidence do we have for that ?
So let me show you some of nature &apos;s patterns that are the result of this .
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space , and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .
It &apos;s a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies .
So there &apos;s a dot on here for every galaxy .
They go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
And just put radially they &apos;re going out that way .
And you see these structures , this thing we call the Great Wall , but there are voids and those kinds of stuff , and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn &apos;t sensitive enough to do it .
Now I &apos;m going to show you this in 3D .
What happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
There are some places you can &apos;t look because of our own galaxy , or because there are no telescopes available to do it .
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around .
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky ?
Remember , every spot on here is a galaxy , and you see the galaxies , you know , sort of in our neighborhood , and you sort of see the structure .
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall , and you see the complicated structure , and you see these voids .
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together , right .
So there &apos;s an interesting pattern , but we don &apos;t have enough data here to actually see the pattern .
We only have a million galaxies , right ?
So we &apos;re keeping , like , a million balls in the air but , what &apos;s going on ?
There &apos;s another survey which is very similar to this , called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey .
Now we &apos;re going to fly through it at warp a million .
And every time there &apos;s a galaxy -- at its location there &apos;s a galaxy -- and if we know anything about the galaxy , which we do , because there &apos;s a redshift measurement and everything , you put in the type of galaxy and the color , so this is the real representation .
And when you &apos;re in the middle of the galaxies it &apos;s hard to see the pattern ; it &apos;s like being in the middle of life .
It &apos;s hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience , it &apos;s hard to see the pattern of this .
So we &apos;re going to go out and swing around and look back at this .
And you &apos;ll see , first , the structure of the survey , and then you &apos;ll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there .
So again , you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here .
But you can see the voids , you can see the complicated structure , and you say , well , how did this happen ?
Suppose you &apos;re the cosmic designer .
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that ?
It &apos;s not just throwing them out at random .
There &apos;s a more complicated process going on here .
How are you going to end up doing that ?
And so now we &apos;re in for some serious play .
That is , we have to seriously play God , not just change people &apos;s lives , but make the universe , right .
So if that &apos;s your responsibility , how are you going to do that ?
What &apos;s the kind of technique ?
What &apos;s the kind of thing you &apos;re going to do ?
So I &apos;m going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like , using , essentially , some of the play principles and some of the design principles that , you know , humans have labored so hard to pick up , but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning .
And that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated .
And then you put in some randomness , some fluctuations and some randomness , and realize a whole bunch of different representations .
So what I &apos;m going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales .
We &apos;re going to zoom in , but this is a plot of what it is .
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .
It &apos;s called dark matter .
That is matter that doesn &apos;t interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does , the way the light &apos;s shining on me or on the stage .
It &apos;s transparent to light , but in order for you to see it , we &apos;re going to make it white . OK ?
So the stuff that &apos;s in this picture that &apos;s white , that is the dark matter .
It should be called invisible matter , but the dark matter we &apos;ve made visible .
And the stuff that is in the yellow color , that is the ordinary kind of matter that &apos;s turned into stars and galaxies .
So I &apos;ll show you the next movie .
So this -- we &apos;re going to zoom in .
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
We &apos;re going to zoom in and zoom in .
And you &apos;ll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids .
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies .
This one we &apos;re zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region .
So we live in the boonies .
We don &apos;t live in the center of the solar system , we don &apos;t live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy &apos;s not in the center of the cluster .
So we &apos;re zooming in .
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000 , on the order of a million galaxies in that region .
We &apos;re going to keep zooming in . OK .
And so I forgot to tell you the scale .
A parsec is 3.26 light years .
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that &apos;s the scale .
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .
Now we &apos;re into a distance sort of between here and here .
That &apos;s the distance between us and Andromeda , right ?
These little specks that you &apos;re seeing in here , they &apos;re galaxies .
Now we &apos;re going to zoom back out , and you can see this structure that , when we get very far out , looks very regular , but it &apos;s made up of a lot of irregular variations .
So they &apos;re simple building blocks .
There &apos;s a very simple fluid to begin with .
It &apos;s got dark matter , it &apos;s got ordinary matter , it &apos;s got photons and it &apos;s got neutrinos , which don &apos;t play much role in the later part of the universe .
And it &apos;s just a simple fluid and it , over time , develops into this complicated structure .
And so you know when you first saw this picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much to you .
Here you &apos;re looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you &apos;re seeing billions of galaxies , right , and nodes , but you realize they &apos;re not even the main structure .
There &apos;s a framework , which is the dark matter , the invisible matter , that &apos;s out there that &apos;s actually holding it all together .
So let &apos;s fly through it , and you can see how much harder it is when you &apos;re in the middle of something to figure this out .
So here &apos;s that same end result .
You see a filament , you see the light is the invisible matter , and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up .
And we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect , and you get a large cluster of galaxies .
And then we &apos;ll fly in to where the very large cluster is , and you can see what it looks like .
And so from inside , it doesn &apos;t look very complicated , right ?
It &apos;s only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it &apos;s a very intricate , complicated kind of a design , right ?
And it &apos;s grown up in some kind of way .
So the question is , how hard would it be to assemble this , right ?
How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together , right ?
That &apos;s the issue , right ?
And so here we are .
You see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together , therefore making this supercluster of galaxies .
And you have to understand , this is not how it would actually look if you -- first , you can &apos;t travel this fast , everything would be distorted , but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff .
This is how , if you took billions of years to go around , it might look to you , right ?
And if you could see invisible matter , too .
And so the idea is , you know , how would you put together the universe in a very simple way ?
We &apos;re going to start and realize that the entire visible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments , was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations , but expanding at a tremendous rate .
And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes , and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background .
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on .
So I &apos;m going to show you a smaller simulation .
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
So I &apos;m going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point , now four times smaller , and so forth .
And you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
And this is a simple one , because it doesn &apos;t have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it .
And you see how the dark matter lumps up , and the ordinary matter just trails along behind .
So there it is .
At the beginning it &apos;s very uniform .
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000 .
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000 , and then over billions of years , gravity just pulls in .
This is light over density , pulls the material around in .
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material .
But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now , in terms of its expansion .
And at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .
So we &apos;re just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see , and then only things that have started forming already are going to form , and then from then on it &apos;s going to go on .
So we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
We need , you know , 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before .
So we have an idea of how to play seriously , creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material , and we create everything we can see in any direction , right , from almost nothing -- that is , something extremely tiny , extremely small -- and it is almost perfect , except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level , which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see , that is , galaxies and stars and so forth .
So we have a model , and we can calculate it , and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like .
And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was .
So this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations , and actually fluctuations on several scales . You can kind of see that .
Since then we &apos;ve had WMAP , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
We see the same large-scale structure , but we see additional small-scale structure .
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth .
You can see , well , you can , kind of pick out all the major continents , but that &apos;s about it .
But what we &apos;re hoping when we get to Planck , we &apos;ll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
And you can also tell , because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together , there are some non-linear processes .
Geology has these effects , which is moving the plates around and so forth .
You can see that just from the map alone .
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non-linear effects that are starting to move , to modify , and are giving us a hint about how space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments .
So that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what I wanted to give you a flavor of .
Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like .
Thank you .
Hi , my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans .
Four years ago , I rowed solo across the Atlantic , and since then , I &apos;ve done two out of three stages across the Pacific , from San Francisco to Hawaii and from Hawaii to Kiribati .
And tomorrow , I &apos;ll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific .
Cumulatively , I will have rowed over 8,000 miles , taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .
This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
We have a bit of a love / hate thing going on .
I feel a bit about it like I did about a very strict math teacher that I once had at school .
I didn &apos;t always like her , but I did respect her , and she taught me a heck of a lot .
So today I &apos;d like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they &apos;ve taught me , and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now .
Now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; Hold on a minute . She doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean rower .
Isn &apos;t she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys ? &quot;
You &apos;ll notice , they &apos;ve all got something that I don &apos;t .
Well , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m talking about the beards .
And no matter how long I &apos;ve spent on the ocean , I haven &apos;t yet managed to muster a decent beard , and I hope that it remains that way .
For a long time , I didn &apos;t believe that I could have a big adventure .
The story that I told myself was that adventurers looked like this .
I didn &apos;t look the part .
I thought there were them and there were us , and I was not one of them .
So for 11 years , I conformed .
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do .
I was working in an office in London as a management consultant .
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn &apos;t the right job for me .
But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years , until I reached my mid-30s and I thought , &quot; You know , I &apos;m not getting any younger .
I feel like I &apos;ve got a purpose in this life , and I don &apos;t know what it is , but I &apos;m pretty certain that management consultancy is not it .
So , fast forward a few years .
I &apos;d gone through some changes .
To try and answer that question of , &quot; What am I supposed to be doing with my life ? &quot;
I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary , the one that I wanted , a life of adventure , and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice , normal , pleasant life , but it wasn &apos;t where I wanted to be by the end of my life .
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of .
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , &quot; Oh boy , I &apos;m on totally the wrong track here .
If I carry on living as I am now , I &apos;m just not going to end up where I want to be in five years , or 10 years , or at the end of my life . &quot;
I made a few changes , let go of some loose trappings of my old life , and through a bit of a leap of logic , decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean .
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua , it &apos;s about 3,000 miles , and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done .
Sure , I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what I &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
And my timing was not great either : 2005 , when I did the Atlantic , was the year of Hurricane Katrina .
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before , since records began .
And pretty early on , those storms started making their presence known .
All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across .
Oars are not supposed to look like this .
But what can you do ? You &apos;re in the middle of the ocean .
Oars are your only means of propulsion .
So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on .
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it .
Then , when that gave out , I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those .
And then when those gave out , I cannibalized one of the broken oars .
I &apos;d never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life , but it &apos;s amazing how resourceful you can become when you &apos;re in the middle of the ocean and there &apos;s only one way to get to the other side .
And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits .
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom .
I really struggled psychologically , totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge , realizing that , if I carried on moving at two miles an hour , 3,000 miles was going to take me a very , very long time .
There were so many times when I thought I &apos;d hit that limit , but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy .
And eventually after 103 days at sea , I arrived in Antigua .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one .
I was euphoric .
And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering , I just felt like a movie star .
It was absolutely wonderful .
And I really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it .
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind .
Number one that I get asked : What do you eat ?
A few freeze-dried meals , but mostly I try and eat much more unprocessed foods .
So I grow my own beansprouts .
I eat fruits and nut bars , a lot of nuts .
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end .
Question number two : How do you sleep ?
With my eyes shut . Ha-ha .
I suppose what you mean is : What happens to the boat while I &apos;m sleeping ?
Well , I plan my route so that I &apos;m drifting with the winds and the currents while I &apos;m sleeping .
On a good night , I think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction .
Worst ever , 13 miles in the wrong direction .
That &apos;s a bad day at the office .
What do I wear ?
Mostly , a baseball cap , rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown , depending on whether I went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion .
Do I have a chase boat ?
No I don &apos;t . I &apos;m totally self-supporting out there .
I don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that I &apos;m at sea , generally .
And finally : Am I crazy ?
Well , I leave that one up to you to judge .
So , how do you top rowing across the Atlantic ?
Well , naturally , you decide to row across the Pacific .
Well , I thought the Atlantic was big , but the Pacific is really , really big .
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps .
I don &apos;t know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world , but I suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we &apos;ve cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
Whereas if you look in Google Earth , this is how the Pacific looks .
It pretty much covers half the planet .
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there .
It is really big -- 65 million square miles -- and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles .
Unfortunately , ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line .
By the time I get to Australia , if I get to Australia , I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all .
So , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in , I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .
The first attempt didn &apos;t go so well .
In 2007 , I did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours .
A bit like being in a washing machine .
Boat got a bit dinged up , so did I.
I blogged about it . Unfortunately , somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving .
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead .
I tried to tell them to go away .
We had a bit of a battle of wills .
I lost and got airlifted .
Awful , really awful .
It was one of the worst feelings of my life , as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again .
So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again .
But what do you do ?
Fall down nine times , get up 10 .
So , the following year , I set out and , fortunately , this time made it safely across to Hawaii .
But it was not without misadventure .
My watermaker broke , only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat .
Powered by my solar panels , it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater .
But it doesn &apos;t react very well to being immersed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
Fortunately , help was at hand .
There was another unusual boat out there at the same time , doing as I was doing , bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch , that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre .
So , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .
They were going very slowly .
Partly , they &apos;d had a bit of a delay .
They &apos;d had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone , and they were starting to sink .
So they &apos;d had to pull in and do all the lids up .
But , as I was approaching the end of my water reserves , luckily , our courses were converging .
They were running out of food ; I was running out of water .
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up .
And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge .
I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
But , eventually , we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard , caught us a beautiful , big mahi-mahi , which was the best food I &apos;d had in , ooh , at least three months .
Fortunately , the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier .
When they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance .
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it , and then we come along and eat that poor critter , and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well .
So there are very real implications for human health .
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive .
And , the following year , set out on the second stage of the Pacific , from Hawaii down to Tarawa .
And you &apos;ll notice something about Tarawa ; it is very low-lying .
It &apos;s that little green sliver on the horizon , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
This is big trouble for these guys .
They &apos;ve got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level .
And also , as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change , they &apos;re expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef , which will contaminate their fresh water supply .
I had a meeting with the president there , who told me about his exit strategy for his country .
He expects that within the next 50 years , the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia .
And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves ; if the places where I &apos;d been born and gone to school and got married , if all those places were just going to disappear forever .
How , literally , ungrounded that would make me feel .
Very shortly , I &apos;ll be setting out to try and get to Australia , and if I &apos;m successful , I &apos;ll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific .
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that I &apos;ve learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
I think there are probably three key points here .
The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves .
For so long , I told myself that I couldn &apos;t have an adventure because I wasn &apos;t six foot tall and athletic and bearded .
And then that story changed .
I found out that people had rowed across oceans .
I even met one of them and she was just about my size .
So even though I didn &apos;t grow any taller , I didn &apos;t sprout a beard , something had changed : My interior dialogue had changed .
At the moment , the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff , that we need oil .
But what about if we just change that story ?
We do have alternatives , and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives , those sustainable ones , to create a greener future .
The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions .
We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean , that it can &apos;t really make a difference .
But it does . Generally , we haven &apos;t got ourselves into this mess through big disasters .
Yes , there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls , but mostly it &apos;s been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals , day after day and year after year .
And , by the same token , we can turn that tide .
We can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions .
And when we do that , we &apos;re not just one person .
Anything that we do spreads ripples .
Other people will see if you &apos;re in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
Maybe if we all start doing this , we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line .
That &apos;s just one example .
This is a world-wide community .
The other point : It &apos;s about taking responsibility .
For so much of my life , I wanted something else to make me happy .
I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life , then I could be happy .
But when I wrote that obituary exercise , I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future .
I couldn &apos;t just wait passively for happiness to come and find me .
And I suppose I &apos;m a selfish environmentalist .
I plan on being around for a long time , and when I &apos;m 90 years old , I want to be happy and healthy .
And it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s racked with famine and drought .
It &apos;s very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we &apos;ve poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
So , shortly , I &apos;m going to be launching a new initiative called Eco-Heroes .
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day .
It &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
We &apos;re going to make an iPhone app out of it .
We just want to try and create that awareness because , sure , changing a light bulb isn &apos;t going to change the world , but that attitude , that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug , that is what could change the world .
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history .
We have a choice . We &apos;ve been blessed , or cursed , with free will .
We can choose a greener future , and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the most important economic fact of our time .
We are living in an age of surging income inequality , particularly between those at the very top and everyone else .
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
It &apos;s happening in communist China , in formerly communist Russia , it &apos;s happening in India , in my own native Canada .
We &apos;re even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden , Finland and Germany .
Let me give you a few numbers to place what &apos;s happening .
In the 1970s , the One Percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States .
Today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
But what &apos;s even more striking is what &apos;s happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution .
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago .
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective , and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich , the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration .
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men , Bill Gates and Warren Buffett , and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population , 120 million people .
Now , as it happens , Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat , he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon , and he has his own favorite number .
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992 , the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars .
Just think about it .
You didn &apos;t even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992 .
Well , today , that figure has more than quintupled to 1.7 trillion , and I probably don &apos;t need to tell you that we haven &apos;t seen anything similar happen to the middle class , whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased .
So we &apos;re living in the age of the global plutocracy , but we &apos;ve been slow to notice it .
One of the reasons , I think , is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon .
Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
Think about what happened , after all , to the poor frog .
But I think there &apos;s something else going on .
Talking about income inequality , even if you &apos;re not on the Forbes 400 list , can make us feel uncomfortable .
It feels less positive , less optimistic , to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger .
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list , talking about income distribution , and inevitably its cousin , income redistribution , can be downright threatening .
So we &apos;re living in the age of surging income inequality , especially at the top .
What &apos;s driving it , and what can we do about it ?
One set of causes is political : lower taxes , deregulation , particularly of financial services , privatization , weaker legal protections for trade unions , all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very , very top .
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don &apos;t actually do much good for the rest of us .
In practice , getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult .
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia , for instance , or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression , or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies , including those whose motto might be &quot; don &apos;t do evil , &quot; to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class .
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really , really hard , at least intellectually , it &apos;s an easy problem .
After all , no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism .
Indeed , this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right .
A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street .
But if crony capitalism is , intellectually at least , the easy part of the problem , things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality .
In and of themselves , these aren &apos;t too mysterious .
Globalization and the technology revolution , the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy , are also powering the rise of the super-rich .
Just think about it .
For the first time in history , if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product , you have almost instant , almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people .
As a result , if you are very , very smart and very , very lucky , you can get very , very rich very , very quickly .
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp .
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for 1.1 billion dollars .
Think about that for a minute : 1.1 billion dollars , 26 years old .
It &apos;s easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields , like sports and entertainment .
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before .
But today , that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy .
We have superstar technologists .
We have superstar bankers .
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects .
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers .
There are even , and this is my personal favorite example , superstar dentists , the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati , the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European-born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg .
But while it &apos;s pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy , what &apos;s a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it .
And that &apos;s because , in contrast with crony capitalism , so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
I love the Internet . I love my mobile devices .
I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium .
I &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world &apos;s poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class , and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world , it &apos;s made many new products affordable -- who do you think built your iPhone ? — and things that we &apos;ve relied on for a long time much cheaper .
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt .
So what &apos;s not to like ?
Well , a few things .
One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy .
Imagine you &apos;re a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process .
It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor .
And that &apos;s no mere hypothetical example .
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks .
These are among the world &apos;s most admired , most beloved , most innovative companies .
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very , very significantly .
And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage ?
Once you have the tremendous economic power that we &apos;re seeing at the very , very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails , it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor .
Again , this is no mere hypothetical .
It &apos;s what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization of Russia &apos;s natural resources .
It &apos;s one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K.
A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy .
One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks , and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today &apos;s economy .
That &apos;s why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children .
The middle class is spending more on schooling too , but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard , Stanford or MIT , the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent .
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve .
As income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy , but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race .
The third thing , and this is what worries me the most , is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs .
When &apos;s the last time you used a travel agent ?
And in contrast with the industrial revolution , the titans of our new economy aren &apos;t creating that many new jobs .
At its zenith , G.M. employed hundreds of thousands , Facebook fewer than 10,000 .
The same is true of globalization .
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets , it &apos;s also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies .
The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity .
That &apos;s shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time .
Since the late 1990s , increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases That means that our countries are getting richer , our companies are getting more efficient , but we &apos;re not creating more jobs and we &apos;re not paying people , as a whole , more .
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment .
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario .
After all , in a totally free labor market , we could find jobs for pretty much everyone .
The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages .
So when I get really depressed about all of this , I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution .
After all , for all its grim , satanic mills , it worked out pretty well , didn &apos;t it ?
After all , all of us here are richer , healthier , taller -- well , there are a few exceptions — and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century .
But it &apos;s important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society , we had to go through two depressions , the Great Depression of the 1930s , the Long Depression of the 1870s , two world wars , communist revolutions in Russia and in China , and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West .
We also , not coincidentally , went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions .
We created the modern welfare state .
We created public education .
We created public health care .
We created public pensions .
We created unions .
Today , we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution .
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats , we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change .
We need a new New Deal .
Sydney . I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney .
I got to the airport , to the hotel , checked in , and , sitting there in the lobby , was a brochure for the Sydney Festival . I thumbed through it , and I came across a show called &quot; Minto : Live . &quot;
The description read : &quot; The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto . &quot;
What was this place called Minto ?
Sydney , as I would learn , is a city of suburbs , and Minto lies southwest , about an hour away .
I have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under .
I mean , I &apos;d thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach , but Minto ? But still , I &apos;m a producer , and the lure of a site-specific theater project was more than I could resist .
So , off I went into Friday afternoon traffic , and I &apos;ll never forget what I saw when I got there .
For the performance , the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house , and the residents , who were the performers , they came out of their houses , and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns , on their driveways .
The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based performance company called Lone Twin .
Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents , and they had created these dances .
This Australian-Indian girl , she came out and started to dance on her front lawn , and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about , and he soon joined her .
And he was followed by her little sister .
And soon they were all dancing this joyous , exuberant dance right there on their lawn .
And as I walked through the neighborhood , I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event .
&quot; Minto : Live &quot; brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists , and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms .
The Sydney Festival which produced &quot; Minto : Live &quot; I think represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival .
These festivals are radically open .
They can transform cities and communities .
To understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we &apos;ve come from .
Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II .
Civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit .
In 1947 , the Edinburgh Festival was born and Avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake .
The work they did was very , very high art , and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit , and you had these seminal shows like &quot; The Mahabharata &quot; and the monumental &quot; Einstein on the Beach . &quot;
But as the decades passed , these festivals , they really became the establishment , and as the culture and capital accelerated , the Internet brought us all together , high and low kind of disappeared , a new kind of festival emerged .
The old festivals , they continued to thrive , but from Brighton to Rio to Perth , something new was emerging , and these festivals were really different .
They &apos;re open , these festivals , because , like in Minto , they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential .
They &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a player , a protagonist , a partner , rather than a passive spectator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings , and so much of the work they do is site-specific or outdoor work .
So , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
Companies like De La Guarda , which I produce , and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action , but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level .
In a series of shows that includes &quot; 100 Percent Vancouver , &quot; &quot; 100 Percent Berlin , &quot; Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class , through a careful process that begins three months before , and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives , and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment .
LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues .
They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere .
You can do a show in a schoolroom , in an airport , — — in a department store window .
Artists are explorers . Who better to show us the city anew ?
Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we haven &apos;t explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
An artist , I think , can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives .
Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour .
We , the audience , were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal .
The actors were right there in front of us , right there among the commuters , and we could hear them , but we might not have otherwise seen them .
So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives .
So , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe .
Royal de Luxe &apos;s giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days .
For &quot; The Sultan &apos;s Elephant , &quot; Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time-traveling elephant .
For a few days , they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned .
The Guardian wrote , &quot; If art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience .
What &apos; The Sultan &apos;s Elephant &apos; represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people . &quot;
We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities , but I &apos;m much &#91; more &#93; interested in many more things , like how a festival helps a city to express itself , how it lets it come into its own .
Festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well-being .
In short , they make cities better places to live .
Case in point : When &quot; The Sultan &apos;s Elephant &quot; came to London just nine months after 7 / 7 , a Londoner wrote , &quot; For the first time since the London bombings , my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice .
She had gathered with others to watch &apos; The Sultan &apos;s Elephant , &apos; and , you know , it just made all the difference . &quot;
Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model .
I think what &apos;s so brilliant about the festivals , the new festivals , is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today .
Thank you very much .
As an Indian , and now as a politician and a government minister , I &apos;ve become rather concerned about the hype we &apos;re hearing about our own country , all this talk about India becoming a world leader , even the next superpower .
In fact , the American publishers of my book , &quot; The Elephant , The Tiger and the Cell Phone , &quot; added a gratuitous subtitle saying , &quot; India : The next 21st-century power . &quot;
And I just don &apos;t think that &apos;s what India &apos;s all about , or should be all about .
Indeed , what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic .
It &apos;s redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads .
After all , what constitutes a world leader ?
If it &apos;s population , we &apos;re on course to top the charts .
We will overtake China by 2034 .
Is it military strength ? Well , we have the world &apos;s fourth largest army .
Is it nuclear capacity ? We know we have that .
The Americans have even recognized it , in an agreement .
Is it the economy ? Well , we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms .
And we continue to grow . When the rest of the world took a beating last year , we grew at 6.7 percent .
But , somehow , none of that adds up to me , to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world , in this part of the 21st century .
And so I wondered , could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else , the attraction of India &apos;s culture , what , in other words , people like to call &quot; soft power . &quot;
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic , Joseph Nye , a friend of mine .
And , very simply , and I &apos;m really cutting it short because of the time limits here , it &apos;s essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture , its political values , its foreign policies .
And , you know , lots of countries do this . He was writing initially about the States , but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power , the British Council .
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power .
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships .
But , the fact is , in fact , that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity .
So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments , but partly despite governments .
And in the information era we all live in today , what we might call the TED age , I &apos;d say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that &apos;s been fed of televised images , of cellphone videos , of email gossip .
In other words , all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries , whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories .
Now , in this age , again , countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage .
And of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
India has more all-news TV channels than any country in the world , in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together .
But , the fact still is that it &apos;s not just that .
In order to have soft power , you have to be connected .
One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country .
I think you &apos;ve already heard the figures .
We &apos;ve been selling 15 million cellphones a month .
Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands , in India .
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market .
In fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S. and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
But , what perhaps some of you don &apos;t realize is how far we &apos;ve come to get there .
You know , when I grew up in India , telephones were a rarity .
In fact , they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy .
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone .
But sometimes it just sat there .
I went to high school in Calcutta .
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer .
But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces , there would be no dial tone .
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number , the odds were two in three you wouldn &apos;t get the number you were intending to reach .
In fact the words &quot; wrong number &quot; were more popular than the word &quot; Hello . &quot;
If you then wanted to connect to another city , let &apos;s say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi , you &apos;d have to book something called a trunk call , and then sit by the phone all day , waiting for it to come through .
Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call .
But , lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through .
In fact , so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this .
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury , not a right , that the government had no obligation to provide better service , and if the honorable Member wasn &apos;t satisfied with his telephone , could he please return it , since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India .
Now , fast-forward to today and this is what you see : the 15 million cell phones a month .
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
You know , if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi , on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century , wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century .
He &apos;s called an isthri wala . But he &apos;s carrying a 21st-century instrument .
He &apos;s carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free , and that &apos;s how he gets orders from the neighborhood , to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed .
The other day I was in Kerala , my home state , at the country farm of a friend , about 20 kilometers away from any place you &apos;d consider urban .
And it was a hot day and he said , &quot; Hey , would you like some fresh coconut water ? &quot;
And it &apos;s the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics , so I said sure .
And he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , &quot; I &apos;m up here . &quot;
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree , with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other , was a local toddy tapper , who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink .
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones .
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices .
Farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they &apos;d harvested could be sold , what price they &apos;d fetch .
They &apos;d often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back , then they &apos;d load the cart .
Today they &apos;re saving half a day &apos;s labor with a two minute phone call .
So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected .
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today .
But , of course that &apos;s not the only thing about India that &apos;s spreading .
You &apos;ve got Bollywood . My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump -- Mr. Shekhar Kapur , forgive me -- and they &apos;re chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio .
And the first goat , chewing away , says , &quot; You know , this film is not bad . &quot;
And the second goat says , &quot; No , the book was better . &quot;
I usually tend to think that the book is usually better , but , having said that , the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe , not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K. , but to the screens of Arabs and Africans , of Senegalese and Syrians .
I &apos;ve met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar , just to watch a Bollywood movie .
She can &apos;t understand the dialogue .
She &apos;s illiterate , so she can &apos;t read the French subtitles .
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps , and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action .
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India , as a result .
And this is happening more and more .
Afghanistan , we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world .
India doesn &apos;t have a military mission there .
You know what was India &apos;s biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years ?
One simple fact : you couldn &apos;t try to call an Afghan at 8 : 30 in the evening .
Why ? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera , &quot; Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi , &quot; dubbed into Dari , was telecast on Tolo T.V.
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history .
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it .
They had to suspend functions at 8 : 30 .
Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom .
Crime went up at 8 : 30 . I have read a Reuters dispatch -- so this is not Indian propaganda , a British news agency -- about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif * stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers , its hubcaps , its sideview mirrors , any moving part they could find , at 8 : 30 , because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store .
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show &apos;s heroine , &quot; Tulsi Zindabad &quot; : &quot; Long live Tulsi . &quot;
That &apos;s soft power . And that is what India is developing through the &quot; E &quot; part of TED : its own entertainment industry .
The same is true , of course -- we don &apos;t have time for too many more examples -- but it &apos;s true of our music , of our dance , of our art , yoga , ayurveda , even Indian cuisine .
I mean , the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student , in the mid &apos; 70s , and what I see today , you can &apos;t go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant . It may not be a very good one .
But , today in Britain , for example , Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining , ship building and iron and steel industries combined .
So the empire can strike back .
But , with this increasing awareness of India , with you and with I , and so on , with tales like Afghanistan , comes something vital in the information era , the sense that in today &apos;s world it &apos;s not the side of the bigger army that wins , it &apos;s the country that tells a better story that prevails .
And India is , and must remain , in my view , the land of the better story .
Stereotypes are changing . I mean , again , having gone to the U.S.
as a student in the mid &apos; 70s , I knew what the image of India was then , if there was an image at all .
Today , people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs , the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT .
This can sometimes have unintended consequences . OK .
I had a friend , a history major like me , who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam , by an anxiously perspiring European saying , &quot; You &apos;re Indian , you &apos;re Indian ! Can you help me fix my laptop ? &quot;
We &apos;ve gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails , and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick , to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses , computer wizards , software gurus .
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world .
But , there is something more substantive to that .
The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism .
It &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
Because India has been an open society for millennia .
India gave refuge to the Jews , fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians , and said thereafter by the Romans .
In fact , legend has is that when Doubting Thomas , the Apostle , Saint Thomas , landed on the shores of Kerala , my home state , somewhere around 52 A.D. , he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl .
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people , which has never encountered a single incident of anti-semitism .
That &apos;s the Indian story .
Islam came peacefully to the south , slightly more differently complicated history in the north .
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India .
You know , we just celebrated , this year , our general elections , the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history .
And the next one will be even bigger , because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year .
But , the fact is that the last elections , five years ago , gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith , Sonia Gandhi , who then made way for a Sikh , Mohan Singh , to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim , President Abdul Kalam , in a country 81 percent Hindu .
This is India , and of course it &apos;s all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S. , the oldest democracy in the modern world , more than 220 years of free and fair elections , which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn &apos;t white , male or Christian .
So , maybe -- oh sorry , he is Christian , I beg your pardon -- and he is male , but he isn &apos;t white .
All the others have been all those three .
All his predecessors have been all those three , and that &apos;s the point I was trying to make .
But , the issue is that when I talked about that example , it &apos;s not just about talking about India , it &apos;s not propaganda .
Because ultimately , that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world .
It was essentially India being itself .
And ultimately , it seems to me , that always works better than propaganda .
Governments aren &apos;t very good at telling stories .
But people see a society for what it is , and that , it seems to me , is what ultimately will make a difference in today &apos;s information era , in today &apos;s TED age .
So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion , because we have every ethnicity known to mankind , practically , we &apos;ve every religion know to mankind , with the possible exception of Shintoism , though that has some Hindu elements somewhere .
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution .
And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note , spelling out the denominations .
We &apos;ve got all of that .
We don &apos;t even have geography uniting us , because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947 .
In fact , you can &apos;t even take the name of the country for granted , because the name &quot; India &quot; comes from the river Indus , which flows in Pakistan .
But , the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea .
It &apos;s the idea of an ever-ever-land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by pluralist democracy .
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one .
And it &apos;s the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste , creed , color , culture , cuisine , custom and costume , consonant , for that matter , and still rally around a consensus .
And the consensus is of a very simple principle , that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don &apos;t really have to agree on everything all the time , so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree .
The great success story of India , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
Now , that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century .
And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India , it isn &apos;t military muscle , economic power .
All of that is necessary , but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome .
Somebody said we are super poor , and we are also super power .
We can &apos;t really be both of those .
We have to overcome our poverty . We have to deal with the hardware of development , the ports , the roads , the airports , all the infrastructural things we need to do , and the software of development , the human capital , the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day , to be able to send his or her children to a decent school , and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves .
But , it &apos;s all taking place , this great adventure of conquering those challenges , those real challenges which none of us can pretend don &apos;t exist .
But , it &apos;s all taking place in an open society , in a rich and diverse and plural civilization , in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people .
That &apos;s why India belongs at TED , and that &apos;s why TED belongs in India .
Thank you very much .
&quot; My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax .
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back .
I &apos;m stylin &apos; , smilin &apos; , lookin &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack .
Ain &apos;t nobody who looks as good as me , but this costs money , it sure ain &apos;t free , and I gots no job , no money at all , but it &apos;s easy to steal all this from the mall .
Parents say I shouldn &apos;t , but I knows I should .
Got to do what I can to make sure I look good , and the reason I have to look real good , well , to tell you the truth , man , I don &apos;t know why . Guess it makes me feel special inside .
When I &apos;m wearing fresh gear I don &apos;t have to hide , and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon .
But security is tight at all the shops . Every day there are more and more cops .
My crew is laughing at me because I &apos;m wearing old gear .
School &apos;s almost over . Summer is near .
And I &apos;m sportin &apos; torn Jordans .
I need something new . Only one thing left to do .
Cut school Friday , catch the subway downtown , check out my victims hangin &apos; around .
Maybe I &apos;ll get lucky and find easy prey .
Got to get some new gear . There &apos;s no other way .
I &apos;m ready and willing . I &apos;m packing my gun .
This is serious business . This ain &apos;t no fun .
And I can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
I &apos;mma cop something dope , just wait , you &apos;ll see .
Come out of the station , West 4th near the park , brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks , &apos; Hey homes , where you get them Nik &apos;s ? &apos; I says to myself , &apos; Yeah . I likes &apos; em , I likes . &apos; They were Q-tip white , bright and blinding my eyes .
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly .
Not one spot of dirt . The Airs were brand new .
Had my pistol and knew just what to do .
Waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind .
He made a left turn on Houston , I pulled out my gun , and I said , &apos; Gimme them Jordans ! &apos; And the punk tried to run .
Took off fast , didn &apos;t get far . I fired , &apos; Pow ! &apos; Fool fell between two parked cars .
He was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet .
While laying there dying , all he could say was , &quot; Please man , don &apos;t take my Air Jordans away . &quot;
You &apos;d think he &apos;d be worried about staying alive .
As I took off with his sneakers , there was tears in his eyes .
Very next day , I bopped into school with my brand new Air Jordans , man , I was cool .
I killed to get &apos; em , but hey , I don &apos;t care , because now I needs a new jacket to wear . &quot;
Thank you .
For the last 15 years that I have been performing , all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world .
See , it wasn &apos;t enough for me to write a book .
It wasn &apos;t enough for me to join a slam competition , and while those things hold weight , it wasn &apos;t the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad .
The hunger and thirst was , and still remains : How do I get people who hate poetry to love me ?
Because I &apos;m an extension of my work , and if they love me , then they will love my work , and if they love my work , then they will love poetry , and if they love poetry , then I will have done my job , which is to transcend it to the world .
And in 1996 , I found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines , who wrote the famous poem , &quot; Please Don &apos;t Take My Air Jordans . &quot;
And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room , and I read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
&quot; Yo &apos; wack .
You know what the problem is with you , homie ?
You don &apos;t read other people &apos;s poetry , and you don &apos;t got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration . &quot;
Now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights .
Now I could have quit . I should have quit .
I mean , I thought poetry was just self-expression .
I didn &apos;t know you actually have to have creative control .
So instead of quitting , I followed him everywhere .
When he was writing a Broadway show , I would be outside of the door .
I would wake him up at , like , 6 : 30 in the morning to ask him who &apos;s the best poet .
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food .
Then one day I told him , &quot; Reg E. , what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration ? &quot;
And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis on a poet named Etheridge Knight and the oral nature of poetry , and from that point , Reggie stopped becoming the best to me , because what Etheridge Knight taught me was that I could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the monosyllables , the ifs , ands , buts , whats , the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear , and from then on , I started chasing Etheridge Knight .
I wanted to know which poet he read , and I landed on a poem called &#91; &quot; Dark Prophecy : Sing of Shine &quot; &#93; , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be : Broadway , baby .
And from that point , I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body .
But that wasn &apos;t the biggest lesson I ever learned .
The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don &apos;t look like I have any experience to be working in this business .
And I said to him , &quot; Listen , punk fool , you &apos;re a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ?
Because people like me took your job .
I &apos;ve traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York , took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt &apos;s Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space , and the one-to-infinite amount of man , woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience .
People have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .
I &apos;m so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet , I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me .
I can master shock of &quot; The Crying Game &quot; with the awe of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double entendre .
I &apos;m so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM . Let me see Chekhov pull that off .
Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself , &quot; Something &apos;s always wrong when nothing &apos;s always right . &quot;
Method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities , believing your own lies are reality , like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop .
Dude , you go to Riker &apos;s Island Academy .
I could make David Mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue , Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw .
So what , your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep ?
Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret .
Boards don &apos;t hit back .
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business ? I &apos;m a suspicious mulatto , which means I &apos;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right .
Forget the American ghetto . I &apos;ve cracked stages in Soweto , buried abortion babies in potter &apos;s field and still managed to keep a smile on my face , so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go-for-this , go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door , whatever slander you send my way , your mother .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a designer and an educator .
I &apos;m a multitasking person , and I push my students to fly through a very creative , multitasking design process .
But how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
Let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
A couple of examples .
Look at that .
This is my multitasking activity result .
So trying to cook , answering the phone , writing SMS , and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue .
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers , so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment .
But what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
When &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
So this is a project I &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super , hyper — to downgrade our super , hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function .
Another example : Have you ever been to Venice ?
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
But our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure ?
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge , but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task , or maybe turning your digital senses totally off .
So nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
Why not ? So find your monotask spot within the multitasking world .
Thank you .
Why can &apos;t we solve these problems ?
We know what they are .
Something always seems to stop us .
Why ?
I remember March the 15th , 2000 .
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
In the newspaper it said &quot; it was all part of a normal process . &quot;
A little bit further on in the article it said &quot; a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace . &quot;
That same word , &quot; normal , &quot; had two different , almost opposite meanings .
If we walk into the B15 iceberg when we leave here today , we &apos;re going to bump into something a thousand feet tall , 76 miles long , 17 miles wide , and it &apos;s going to weigh two gigatons .
I &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
And yet I think it &apos;s this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
Only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred .
It was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome .
This is the code that &apos;s in every single one of our 50 trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are .
And if we just take one cell &apos;s worth of this code and unwind it , it &apos;s a meter long , two nanometers thick .
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness .
And I wondered , what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places , where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms ?
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy , the electron ?
So I started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists I could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there , and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas .
Six and a half years later , a hundred and eighty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and I will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , cleanly , safely , and cheaply .
Think of the space that we spend most of our time .
A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .
We like the light that comes into the room , but in the middle of summer , all that heat is coming into the room that we &apos;re trying to keep cool .
In winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
We &apos;re trying to heat up the space that we &apos;re in , and all that is trying to get out through the window .
Wouldn &apos;t it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?
One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
But this chickenwire carbon , called a carbon nanotube , is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs .
It &apos;s a thousand times more conductive than copper .
How is that possible ?
One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently .
You think of carbon as black .
Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
And when it &apos;s in this form , if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it &apos;s in its colored state , it will reflect away all heat and light , and when it &apos;s in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between .
To change its state , by the way , takes two volts from a millisecond pulse .
And once you &apos;ve changed its state , it stays there until you change its state again .
As we were working on this incredible discovery at University of Florida , we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist , and he was working on a pretty incredible thing .
Imagine if we didn &apos;t have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night .
We &apos;d have to see at night , right ?
This lets you do it .
It &apos;s a nanomaterial , two nanomaterials , a detector and an imager .
The total width of it is 600 times smaller than the width of a decimal place .
And it takes all the infrared available at night , converts it into an electron in the space of two small films , and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through .
I &apos;m going to show to TEDsters , the first time , this operating .
Firstly I &apos;m going to show you the transparency .
Transparency is key .
It &apos;s a film that you can look through .
And then I &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
And you can see , off a tiny film , incredible clarity .
As we were working on this , it dawned on us : this is taking infrared radiation , wavelengths , and converting it into electrons .
What if we combined it with this ?
Suddenly you &apos;ve converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window .
But because it &apos;s flexible , it can be on any surface whatsoever .
The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
We talked about generating and using .
We want to talk about storing energy , and unfortunately the best thing we &apos;ve got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago , the lead acid battery .
In terms of dollars per what &apos;s stored , it &apos;s simply the best .
Knowing that we &apos;re not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power , we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas , and we gave them this diagram .
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas / Fort Worth Airport .
We said , &quot; Could you build this ? &quot;
And these scientists , instead of laughing at us , said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And what they built was eBox .
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside , hold it until you need it , and then be able to release it and pass it off .
Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly , efficiently and cheaply right where I am .
It &apos;s my energy .
And if I don &apos;t need it , I can convert it back up on the window to energy , light , and beam it , line of site , to your place .
And for that I do not need an electric grid between us .
The grid of tomorrow is no grid , and energy , clean efficient energy , will one day be free .
If you do this , you get the last puzzle piece , which is water .
Each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we &apos;re human .
When we run out of water , as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world , we &apos;re going to have to get this from the sea , and that &apos;s going to require us to build desalination plants .
19 trillion dollars is what we &apos;re going to have to spend .
These also require tremendous amounts of energy .
In fact , it &apos;s going to require twice the world &apos;s supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water .
We &apos;re simply not going to do that .
But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
I &apos;m glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists , no kinder than many of the people in the world , but they have a magic look at the world .
And I &apos;m glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world .
It &apos;s been a long time in coming for me .
18 years ago , I saw a photograph in the paper .
It was taken by Kevin Carter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there .
I &apos;ve carried this photograph with me every day since then .
It &apos;s a picture of a little girl dying of thirst .
By any standard this is wrong .
It &apos;s just wrong .
We can do better than this .
We should do better than this .
And whenever I go round to somebody who says , &quot; You know what , you &apos;re working on something that &apos;s too difficult .
It &apos;ll never happen . You don &apos;t have enough money .
You don &apos;t have enough time .
There &apos;s something much more interesting around the corner , &quot; I say , &quot; Try saying that to her . &quot;
That &apos;s what I say in my mind . And I just say &quot; thank you , &quot; and I go on to the next one .
This is why we have to solve our problems , and I know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature , the stuff of life : the simple electron .
Thank you .
Power .
That is the word that comes to mind .
We &apos;re the new technologists .
We have a lot of data , so we have a lot of power .
How much power do we have ?
Scene from a movie : &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; -- great movie .
We &apos;ve got to get our hero , Captain Willard , to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz .
The way we &apos;re going to do this is fly him in and drop him off .
So the scene : the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in .
And there &apos;s this loud , thrilling music in the background , this wild music .
Dum da ta da dum Dum da ta da dum Da ta da da That &apos;s a lot of power .
That &apos;s the kind of power I feel in this room .
That &apos;s the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have .
Let &apos;s take an example .
What can we do with just one person &apos;s data ?
What can we do with that guy &apos;s data ?
I can look at your financial records .
I can tell if you pay your bills on time .
I know if you &apos;re good to give a loan to .
I can look at your medical records ; I can see if your pump is still pumping -- see if you &apos;re good to offer insurance to .
I can look at your clicking patterns .
When you come to my website , I actually know what you &apos;re going to do already because I &apos;ve seen you visit millions of websites before .
And I &apos;m sorry to tell you , you &apos;re like a poker player , you have a tell .
I can tell with data analysis what you &apos;re going to do before you even do it .
I know what you like . I know who you are , and that &apos;s even before I look at your mail or your phone .
Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have .
But I &apos;m not actually here to talk about what we can do .
I &apos;m here to talk about what we should do .
What &apos;s the right thing to do ?
Now I see some puzzled looks like , &quot; Why are you asking us what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
We &apos;re just building this stuff . Somebody else is using it . &quot;
Fair enough .
But it brings me back .
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then , some of our great physicists , studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .
We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they &apos;ll build .
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .
So what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
Should we be collecting it , gathering it , so we can make his online experience better ?
So we can make money ?
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ?
Or should we respect his privacy , protect his dignity and leave him alone ?
Which one is it ?
How should we figure it out ?
I know : crowdsource . Let &apos;s crowdsource this .
So to get people warmed up , let &apos;s start with an easy question -- something I &apos;m sure everybody here has an opinion about : iPhone versus Android .
Let &apos;s do a show of hands -- iPhone .
Uh huh .
Android .
You &apos;d think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn &apos;t be such suckers just for the pretty phones .
Next question , a little bit harder .
Should we be collecting all of that guy &apos;s data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he &apos;s up to no good ?
Or should we leave him alone ?
Collect his data .
Leave him alone .
You &apos;re safe . It &apos;s fine .
Okay , last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case , should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework , or should we use a Millian consequentialist one ?
Kant .
Mill .
Not as many votes .
Yeah , that &apos;s a terrifying result .
Terrifying , because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions .
How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don &apos;t have a moral framework ?
We know more about mobile operating systems , but what we really need is a moral operating system .
What &apos;s a moral operating system ?
We all know right and wrong , right ?
You feel good when you do something right , you feel bad when you do something wrong .
Our parents teach us that : praise with the good , scold with the bad .
But how do we figure out what &apos;s right and wrong ?
And from day to day , we have the techniques that we use .
Maybe we just follow our gut .
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource .
Or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department , see what they say .
In other words , it &apos;s kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
And maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
So let &apos;s get a moral framework .
We &apos;re numbers people , living by numbers .
How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework ?
I know a guy who did exactly that .
A brilliant guy -- he &apos;s been dead 2,500 years .
Plato , that &apos;s right .
Remember him -- old philosopher ?
You were sleeping during that class .
And Plato , he had a lot of the same concerns that we did .
He was worried about right and wrong .
He wanted to know what is just .
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .
He says something &apos;s just . She says something else is just .
It &apos;s kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too .
I &apos;m just going back and forth ; I &apos;m not getting anywhere .
I don &apos;t want opinions ; I want knowledge .
I want to know the truth about justice -- like we have truths in math .
In math , we know the objective facts .
Take a number , any number -- two .
Favorite number . I love that number .
There are truths about two .
If you &apos;ve got two of something , you add two more , you get four .
That &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s an objective truth about the form of two , the abstract form .
When you have two of anything -- two eyes , two ears , two noses , just two protrusions -- those all partake of the form of two .
They all participate in the truths that two has .
They all have two-ness in them .
And therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
What if , Plato thought , ethics was like math ?
What if there were a pure form of justice ?
What if there are truths about justice , and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated , partook of that form of justice ?
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn &apos;t .
It wouldn &apos;t be a matter of just opinion or just appearances .
That &apos;s a stunning vision .
I mean , think about that . How grand . How ambitious .
That &apos;s as ambitious as we are .
He wants to solve ethics .
He wants objective truths .
If you think that way , you have a Platonist moral framework .
If you don &apos;t think that way , well , you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy , because the tidy idea , you know , people criticized it .
Aristotle , in particular , he was not amused .
He thought it was impractical .
Aristotle said , &quot; We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows . &quot;
Aristotle thought ethics wasn &apos;t a lot like math .
He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now using our best judgment to find the right path .
If you think that , Plato &apos;s not your guy .
But don &apos;t give up .
Maybe there &apos;s another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework .
How about this : What if in any situation you could just calculate , look at the choices , measure out which one &apos;s better and know what to do ?
That sound familiar ?
That &apos;s a utilitarian moral framework .
John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this -- nice guy besides -- and only been dead 200 years .
So basis of utilitarianism -- I &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar at least .
The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this .
But here &apos;s the way it works .
What if morals , what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain ?
It does something intrinsic to the act .
It &apos;s not like its relation to some abstract form .
It &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
You just look at the consequences and see if , overall , it &apos;s for the good or for the worse .
That would be simple . Then we know what to do .
Let &apos;s take an example .
Suppose I go up and I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to take your phone . &quot;
Not just because it rang earlier , but I &apos;m going to take it because I made a little calculation .
I thought , that guy looks suspicious .
And what if he &apos;s been sending little messages to Bin Laden &apos;s hideout -- or whoever took over after Bin Laden -- and he &apos;s actually like a terrorist , a sleeper cell .
I &apos;m going to find that out , and when I find that out , I &apos;m going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause .
That has a very high utility to prevent that damage .
And compared to the little pain that it &apos;s going to cause -- because it &apos;s going to be embarrassing when I &apos;m looking on his phone and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit -- that &apos;s overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
If you feel that way , that &apos;s a utilitarian choice .
But maybe you don &apos;t feel that way either .
Maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
It &apos;s wrong to take his phone because he &apos;s a person and he has rights and he has dignity , and we can &apos;t just interfere with that .
He has autonomy .
It doesn &apos;t matter what the calculations are .
There are things that are intrinsically wrong -- like lying is wrong , like torturing innocent children is wrong .
Kant was very good on this point , and he said it a little better than I &apos;ll say it .
He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct , and then it is our duty to follow those rules .
It &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
So let &apos;s stop .
We &apos;re right in the thick of it , this philosophical thicket .
And this goes on for thousands of years , because these are hard questions , and I &apos;ve only got 15 minutes .
So let &apos;s cut to the chase .
How should we be making our decisions ?
Is it Plato , is it Aristotle , is it Kant , is it Mill ?
What should we be doing ? What &apos;s the answer ?
What &apos;s the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do , whether we should use that guy &apos;s data or not ?
What &apos;s the formula ?
There &apos;s not a formula .
There &apos;s not a simple answer .
Ethics is hard .
Ethics requires thinking .
And that &apos;s uncomfortable .
I know ; I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers .
But they can &apos;t .
You can &apos;t just take human thinking and put it into a machine .
We &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
Happily , we &apos;re not machines , and we can do it .
Not only can we think , we must .
Hannah Arendt said , &quot; The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil .
It arises from not thinking . &quot;
That &apos;s what she called the &quot; banality of evil . &quot;
And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person .
So let &apos;s do that . Let &apos;s think .
In fact , let &apos;s start right now .
Every person in this room do this : think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing , where you wondered , &quot; What should I be doing ? &quot;
Bring that to mind , and now reflect on that and say , &quot; How did I come up that decision ?
What did I do ? Did I follow my gut ?
Did I have somebody vote on it ? Or did I punt to legal ? &quot;
Or now we have a few more choices .
&quot; Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would ?
Or like Kant , did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right ? &quot;
Think about it . Really bring it to mind . This is important .
It is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this .
Are you ready ? Go .
Stop . Good work .
What you just did , that &apos;s the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power .
Now the next step -- try this .
Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision .
Not right now . Wait till I finish talking .
Do it over lunch .
And don &apos;t just find another technologist friend ; find somebody different than you .
Find an artist or a writer -- or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
In fact , find somebody from the humanities .
Why ? Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists .
Just a few days ago , right across the street from here , there was hundreds of people gathered together .
It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference .
And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective .
You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature .
You &apos;re thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital ?
Well that &apos;s interesting . That &apos;s a different way of thinking .
And when you think in that way , you become more sensitive to the human considerations , which are crucial to making ethical decisions .
So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend .
And you &apos;re telling him what we &apos;re talking about , about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music .
Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum Well , your musician friend will stop you and say , &quot; You know , the theme music for your data revolution , that &apos;s an opera , that &apos;s Wagner .
It &apos;s based on Norse legend .
It &apos;s Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry . &quot;
That &apos;s interesting .
Now it &apos;s also a beautiful opera , and we &apos;re moved by that opera .
We &apos;re moved because it &apos;s about the battle between good and evil , about right and wrong .
And we care about right and wrong .
We care what happens in that opera .
We care what happens in &quot; Apocalypse Now . &quot;
And we certainly care what happens with our technologies .
We have so much power today , it is up to us to figure out what to do , and that &apos;s the good news .
We &apos;re the ones writing this opera .
This is our movie .
We figure out what will happen with this technology .
We determine how this will all end .
Thank you .
The &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
And the job in question was sheep rancher .
My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it -- it &apos;s pretty simple .
I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
So , normally , I never do any research at all .
But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
And they &apos;re like , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot;
They use a band -- basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
And I said , &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
&quot; Great -- got it . &quot;
OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it .
I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it -- but they confirm it .
OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I go out .
And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
Melanie is the wife of Albert .
Albert is the shepherd in question .
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
Alright . Great .
Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very -- it was , it was impressive .
In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael -- you don &apos;t , OK ?
He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
Can we roll the video ?
No I &apos;m kidding -- we don &apos;t -- I thought it best to talk in pictures .
So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; shoot , ever .
I say , &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot;
You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse -- we shoot what we get !
I said , &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot;
I mean , you know .
&quot; This is crazy .
We can &apos;t do this . &quot;
And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; What ? &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot;
And he said &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot;
And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot;
And he says , &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
He says , &quot; OK . &quot;
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; Albert , how long ?
When does he get up ? &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; A day . &quot;
I said , &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot;
&quot; A week . &quot;
Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ...
Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
Albert hands me the knife .
I go in , tail comes off .
I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
Albert instructs , &quot; Push it way up there . &quot;
I do .
&quot; Push it further . &quot;
I do .
The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs , coming right at you -- and he says , &quot; Bite &apos; em .
Just bite &apos; em off . &quot;
And I heard him , I heard all the words .
Like , how did -- how did I get here ?
How did -- you know -- I mean -- how did I get here ?
It &apos;s just -- it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
I went in and I took them .
I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
And now I can &apos;t get -- I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; Poetics , &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking -- out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
Great .
The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know -- Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
And this metaphor in my head -- I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; right ?
Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom -- &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; -- peripetia .
You know ?
It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
Neo in &quot; The Matrix , &quot; you know ?
&quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; -- that &apos;s weird .
These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK .
Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
And I talk to him .
And he says , &quot; Hey Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot;
I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
&quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot;
You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God -- I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
Follow your passion -- we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Probably the worst advice I ever got .
You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
I can give you 30 examples , right now -- Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
He &apos;s making a great living .
You ask him , &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot;
and he &apos;d laugh at you .
The guy &apos;s worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s -- come on .
So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness -- as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; successories &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
That stuff -- it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
Safety -- safety first ?
Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
I mean -- this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say -- but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
Right ?
No , I mean really .
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season .
We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
Unspeakably dangerous .
I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot;
And he points out there .
But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; Son &quot; -- he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that -- he says , &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot;
You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
And for the rest of that day , safety first .
I was like -- So , the idea that we create this false -- this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
But , what it all comes down to is this .
I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
It goes like this -- we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we portray working people on TV -- it &apos;s laughable .
If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
You see him all the time .
That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
That &apos;s what TV does .
We try hard on &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner -- it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
How many people have their Blackberries ?
We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
Good grief , not to this crowd .
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; guys know it has to be done .
Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
And I realized , probably too late in this game -- I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
I got a lot wrong .
So , we &apos;re thinking -- by we , I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of -- you know , kind of lost a little .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers -- that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
I &apos;m a medical illustrator , and I come from a slightly different point of view .
I &apos;ve been watching , since I grew up , the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences .
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date .
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things , by meaning they are things you can worship .
They are ideals that are powerful . They are irreducible .
They are unique . They are useful -- sometimes , often a long time after the fact .
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now , because I don &apos;t want to look at me on the screen .
Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences .
They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed .
If you look at the math , E = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there &apos;s an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand .
And what I &apos;ve tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them , but the way they &apos;re taught is compartmentalized and it &apos;s drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident .
It &apos;s almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .
We don &apos;t want to do that to our students .
So we have an opportunity to really open up education .
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard , in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department , a couple of years ago . He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard .
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on .
They could have a mental image of the cell as a large , bustling , hugely complicated city that &apos;s occupied by micro-machines .
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life .
These micro-machines , which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over , are self-directed , powerful , precise , accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids .
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves .
They power how a cell replicates . They power our hearts .
They power our minds .
how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard , which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information , in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually , so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty , and be able to study with this view in mind , so that their imaginations would be sparked , so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out , really , how life works .
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together .
We worked with a theme , which is , you &apos;ve got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary , and they &apos;re touching the surface of the capillary wall , and they &apos;re picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall , and they are given this information that there &apos;s an inflammation somewhere outside , where they can &apos;t see and sense .
But they get the information that causes them to stop , causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape , and try to get out of this capillary and find out what &apos;s going on .
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved , and figure out what they did .
And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on , but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening .
And so what I &apos;m going to show you is a three-minute Reader &apos;s Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced . It &apos;s an ongoing project that &apos;s going to go another four or five years .
And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines , they &apos;re called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size .
Run the movie , please .
But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing , and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other .
They pass information to each other .
They cause different things to happen inside the cell .
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly , from information that &apos;s brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes .
No life , from the smallest life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro-machines .
In fact , it would really , in the absence of these machines , have made the attendance here , Chris , really quite sparse .
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell .
This little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that &apos;s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it &apos;s needed in the cell -- whether it &apos;s to a membrane , whether it &apos;s to an organelle , whether it &apos;s to build something or repair something .
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around , right now , inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .
So no matter how lazy you feel , you &apos;re not really intrinsically doing nothing .
So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this , and think about how powerful our cells are .
And think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
Once we figure out all that &apos;s going on -- and believe me , we know almost a percent of what &apos;s going on -- once we figure out what &apos;s going on , we &apos;re really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health , with what we do with future generations , and how long we &apos;re going to live .
And hopefully we &apos;ll be able to use this to discover more truth , and more beauty .
But it &apos;s really quite amazing that these cells , these micro-machines , are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding .
They work together . They make the cell do what it needs to do .
And their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly .
Enjoy the rest of the show . Thank you .
As other speakers have said , it &apos;s a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience .
But unlike the other speakers , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world .
Or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy .
My brief , as you &apos;ve just heard , is to tell you about statistics -- and , to be more precise , to tell you some exciting things about statistics .
And that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me .
One of my senior colleagues told me , when I was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants .
And there &apos;s another in-joke among statisticians , and that &apos;s , &quot; How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician ? &quot;
To which the answer is , &quot; The extroverted statistician &apos;s the one who looks at the other person &apos;s shoes . &quot;
But I want to tell you something useful -- and here it is , so concentrate now .
This evening , there &apos;s a reception in the University &apos;s Museum of Natural History .
And it &apos;s a wonderful setting , as I hope you &apos;ll find , and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition .
It &apos;s very unlikely -- in this special setting , and this collection of people -- but you might just find yourself talking to someone you &apos;d rather wish that you weren &apos;t .
So here &apos;s what you do .
When they say to you , &quot; What do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; I &apos;m a statistician . &quot;
Well , except they &apos;ve been pre-warned now , and they &apos;ll know you &apos;re making it up .
And then one of two things will happen .
They &apos;ll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them .
Or they &apos;ll suddenly become parched and / or hungry -- and often both -- and sprint off for a drink and some food .
And you &apos;ll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to .
It &apos;s one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do .
We &apos;re not top on people &apos;s lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
And it &apos;s something I &apos;ve never really found a good way of doing .
But my wife -- who was then my girlfriend -- managed it much better than I &apos;ve ever been able to .
Many years ago , when we first started going out , she was working for the BBC in Britain , and I was , at that stage , working in America .
I was coming back to visit her .
She told this to one of her colleagues , who said , &quot; Well , what does your boyfriend do ? &quot;
Sarah thought quite hard about the things I &apos;d explained -- and she concentrated , in those days , on listening .
Don &apos;t tell her I said that .
And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics .
So when her colleague said , &quot; What does he do ? &quot;
She paused and said , &quot; He models things . &quot;
Well , her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said , &quot; What does he model ? &quot;
Well , Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said , &quot; Genes . &quot;
&quot; He models genes . &quot;
That is my first love , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about .
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
So you &apos;ve had a pretty easy time up till now -- a few laughs , and all that kind of thing -- in the talks to date .
You &apos;ve got to think , and I &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
So here &apos;s the scene for the first question I &apos;m going to ask you .
Can you imagine tossing a coin successively ?
And for some reason -- which shall remain rather vague -- we &apos;re interested in a particular pattern .
Here &apos;s one -- a head , followed by a tail , followed by a tail .
So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly .
Then the pattern , head-tail-tail , that we &apos;ve suddenly become fixated with happens here .
And you can count : one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 -- it happens after the 10th toss .
So you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment .
Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins , and they toss them until they first see the pattern head-tail-tail .
The first time they do it , maybe it happens after the 10th toss , as here .
The second time , maybe it &apos;s after the fourth toss .
The next time , after the 15th toss .
So you do that lots and lots of times , and you average those numbers .
That &apos;s what I want this side to think about .
The other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head .
So , on this side , you get out your coins , and you toss and toss and toss .
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them . OK ?
So on this side , you &apos;ve got a number -- you &apos;ve done it lots of times , so you get it accurately -- which is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail .
On this side , you &apos;ve got a number -- the average number of tosses until head-tail-head .
So here &apos;s a deep mathematical fact -- if you &apos;ve got two numbers , one of three things must be true .
Either they &apos;re the same , or this one &apos;s bigger than this one , or this one &apos;s bigger than that one .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
So you &apos;ve all got to think about this , and you &apos;ve all got to vote -- and we &apos;re not moving on .
And I don &apos;t want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it , until everyone &apos;s expressed a view . OK .
So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail .
Who thinks that A is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?
Who thinks that B is true -- that on average , they &apos;re the same ?
Who thinks that C is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?
OK , who hasn &apos;t voted yet ? Because that &apos;s really naughty -- I said you had to .
OK . So most people think B is true .
And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that .
It &apos;s not . A is true here .
It takes longer , on average .
In fact , the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10 and the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight .
How could that be ?
Anything different about the two patterns ?
There is . Head-tail-head overlaps itself .
If you went head-tail-head-tail-head , you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses .
You can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
That turns out to be important .
There are two ways of thinking about this .
I &apos;ll give you one of them .
So imagine -- let &apos;s suppose we &apos;re doing it .
On this side -- remember , you &apos;re excited about head-tail-tail ; you &apos;re excited about head-tail-head .
We start tossing a coin , and we get a head -- and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful , or awesome , might be about to happen .
The next toss is a tail -- you get really excited .
The champagne &apos;s on ice just next to you ; you &apos;ve got the glasses chilled to celebrate .
You &apos;re waiting with bated breath for the final toss .
And if it comes down a head , that &apos;s great .
You &apos;re done , and you celebrate .
If it &apos;s a tail -- well , rather disappointedly , you put the glasses away and put the champagne back .
And you keep tossing , to wait for the next head , to get excited .
On this side , there &apos;s a different experience .
It &apos;s the same for the first two parts of the sequence .
You &apos;re a little bit excited with the first head -- you get rather more excited with the next tail .
Then you toss the coin .
If it &apos;s a tail , you crack open the champagne .
If it &apos;s a head you &apos;re disappointed , but you &apos;re still a third of the way to your pattern again .
And that &apos;s an informal way of presenting it -- that &apos;s why there &apos;s a difference .
Another way of thinking about it -- if we tossed a coin eight million times , then we &apos;d expect a million head-tail-heads and a million head-tail-tails -- but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps .
So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping , the clumps will be further apart .
It &apos;s another way of getting the intuition .
What &apos;s the point I want to make ?
It &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you &apos;re in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
This is my little diversion into my real passion , which is genetics .
There &apos;s a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics , and it &apos;s the following .
When you toss a coin , you get a sequence of heads and tails .
When you look at DNA , there &apos;s a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails -- but four letters -- As , Gs , Cs and Ts .
And there are little chemical scissors , called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns .
And they &apos;re an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .
And instead of asking the question , &quot; How long until I see a head-tail-head ? &quot; -- you can ask , &quot; How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G , for example ?
How long will those chunks be ? &quot;
That &apos;s a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics .
There &apos;s a much deeper connection , which I don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
And we &apos;ll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that .
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you &apos;ll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .
And I will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in Oxford , both of which I think are rather exciting .
You know about the Human Genome Project .
That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome .
The natural thing to do after you &apos;ve done that -- and that &apos;s what this project , the International HapMap Project , which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries .
Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we &apos;ve got in common , and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people .
Why do we care about that ?
Well , there are lots of reasons .
The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes , for example -- and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease , or stroke , or autism and so on .
That &apos;s one big project .
There &apos;s a second big project , recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country , involving very large studies -- thousands of individuals , with each of eight different diseases , common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes , and coronary heart disease , bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics .
To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
Why do we want to do that ?
Because we understand very little about most human diseases .
We don &apos;t know what causes them .
And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics , we &apos;ll have a window on the way the disease works , and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on .
So that &apos;s , as I said , the little diversion on my main love .
Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty .
Here &apos;s another quiz for you -- now suppose we &apos;ve got a test for a disease which isn &apos;t infallible , but it &apos;s pretty good .
It gets it right 99 percent of the time .
And I take one of you , or I take someone off the street , and I test them for the disease in question .
Let &apos;s suppose there &apos;s a test for HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- and the test says the person has the disease .
What &apos;s the chance that they do ?
The test gets it right 99 percent of the time .
So a natural answer is 99 percent .
Who likes that answer ?
Come on -- everyone &apos;s got to get involved .
Don &apos;t think you don &apos;t trust me anymore .
Well , you &apos;re right to be a bit skeptical , because that &apos;s not the answer .
That &apos;s what you might think .
It &apos;s not the answer , and it &apos;s not because it &apos;s only part of the story .
It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is .
So let me try and illustrate that .
Here &apos;s a little caricature of a million individuals .
So let &apos;s think about a disease that affects -- it &apos;s pretty rare , it affects one person in 10,000 .
Amongst these million individuals , most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease .
And in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won &apos;t .
So now suppose we test them all .
What happens ?
Well , amongst the 100 who do have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time , and 99 will test positive .
Amongst all these other people who don &apos;t have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time .
It &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
But there are so many of them that there &apos;ll be an enormous number of false positives .
Put that another way -- of all of them who test positive -- so here they are , the individuals involved -- less than one in 100 actually have the disease .
So even though we think the test is accurate , the important part of the story is there &apos;s another bit of information we need .
Here &apos;s the key intuition .
What we have to do , once we know the test is positive , is to weigh up the plausibility , or the likelihood , of two competing explanations .
Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
One explanation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
The other explanation is that the person does have the disease -- that &apos;s unlikely -- but the test gets it right , which is likely .
And the number we end up with -- that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 -- is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other .
Each of them taken together is unlikely .
Here &apos;s a more topical example of exactly the same thing .
Those of you in Britain will know about what &apos;s become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark , who had two babies who died suddenly .
And initially , it was thought that they died of what &apos;s known informally as &quot; cot death , &quot; and more formally as &quot; Sudden Infant Death Syndrome . &quot;
For various reasons , she was later charged with murder .
And at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million .
To cut a long story short , she was convicted at the time .
Later , and fairly recently , acquitted on appeal -- in fact , on the second appeal .
And just to set it in context , you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child , and then two , if they &apos;re innocent , to be convicted of murdering them .
To be put through the stress of the trial , convicted of murdering them -- and to spend time in a women &apos;s prison , where all the other prisoners think you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone .
And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong , in two different ways .
So where did he get the one in 73 million number ?
He looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark &apos;s is about one in 8,500 .
So he said , &quot; I &apos;ll assume that if you have one cot death in a family , the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren &apos;t changed . &quot;
So that &apos;s what statisticians would call an assumption of independence .
It &apos;s like saying , &quot; If you toss a coin and get a head the first time , that won &apos;t affect the chance of getting a head the second time . &quot;
So if you toss a coin twice , the chance of getting a head twice are a half -- that &apos;s the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time .
So he said , &quot; Here , I &apos;ll assume that these events are independent .
When you multiply 8,500 together twice , you get about 73 million . &quot;
And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way .
Unfortunately here -- and , really , regrettably -- first of all , in a situation like this you &apos;d have to verify it empirically .
And secondly , it &apos;s palpably false .
There are lots and lots of things that we don &apos;t know about sudden infant deaths .
It might well be that there are environmental factors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we &apos;re not aware of .
So if a family suffers from one cot death , you &apos;d put them in a high-risk group .
They &apos;ve probably got these environmental risk factors and / or genetic risk factors we don &apos;t know about .
And to argue , then , that the chance of a second death is as if you didn &apos;t know that information is really silly .
It &apos;s worse than silly -- it &apos;s really bad science .
Nonetheless , that &apos;s how it was presented , and at trial nobody even argued it .
That &apos;s the first problem .
The second problem is , what does the number of one in 73 million mean ?
So after Sally Clark was convicted -- you can imagine , it made rather a splash in the press -- one of the journalists from one of Britain &apos;s more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was , &quot; The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million . &quot;
Now , that &apos;s a logical error .
It &apos;s exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test , which is 99 percent accurate , the chance of having the disease is 99 percent .
In the disease example , we had to bear in mind two things , one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not .
And the other one was the chance , a priori , that the person had the disease or not .
It &apos;s exactly the same in this context .
There are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation .
We want to know how likely , or relatively how likely , two different explanations are .
One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent -- which is , a priori , overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don &apos;t kill their children .
And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event .
Not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but nonetheless rather unlikely .
The other explanation is that she was guilty .
Now , we probably think a priori that &apos;s unlikely .
And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that &apos;s unlikely , because of the presumption of innocence .
And then if she were trying to kill the children , she succeeded .
So the chance that she &apos;s innocent isn &apos;t one in 73 million .
We don &apos;t know what it is .
It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence .
We know the children died .
What matters is how likely or unlikely , relative to each other , the two explanations are .
And they &apos;re both implausible .
There &apos;s a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences .
In fact , there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician , who have subsequently been released on appeal .
Many cases were reviewed .
And it &apos;s particularly topical because he &apos;s currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain &apos;s General Medical Council .
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this ?
Well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life .
It &apos;s also true -- and , although , you , as a collective , are very special in many ways , you &apos;re completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right .
It &apos;s very well documented that people get things wrong .
They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty .
We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
That &apos;s an issue in our everyday lives .
As you &apos;ve heard from many of the talks , statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science -- in social science , in medicine and indeed , quite a lot of industry .
All of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is underpinned by statistics .
It &apos;s something we &apos;re bad at doing .
At the very least , we should recognize that , and we tend not to .
To go back to the legal context , at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said .
So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury , &quot; I know how to build bridges . I &apos;ve built one down the road .
Please drive your car home over it , &quot; they would have said , &quot; Well , pediatricians don &apos;t know how to build bridges .
That &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
On the other hand , he came out and effectively said , or implied , &quot; I know how to reason with uncertainty . I know how to do statistics . &quot;
And everyone said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s fine . He &apos;s an expert . &quot;
So we need to understand where our competence is and isn &apos;t .
Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling , when scientists , and lawyers and in some cases judges , routinely misrepresented evidence .
Usually -- one hopes -- innocently , but misrepresented evidence .
Forensic scientists said , &quot; The chance that this guy &apos;s innocent is one in three million . &quot;
Even if you believe the number , just like the 73 million to one , that &apos;s not what it meant .
And there have been celebrated appeal cases And just to finish in the context of the legal system .
It &apos;s all very well to say , &quot; Let &apos;s do our best to present the evidence . &quot;
But more and more , in cases of DNA profiling -- this is another one -- we expect juries , who are ordinary people -- and it &apos;s documented they &apos;re very bad at this -- we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on .
In other spheres of life , if people argued -- well , except possibly for politics -- but in other spheres of life , if people argued illogically , we &apos;d say that &apos;s not a good thing .
We sort of expect it of politicians and don &apos;t hope for much more .
In the case of uncertainty , we get it wrong all the time -- and at the very least , we should be aware of that , and ideally , we might try and do something about it .
Thanks very much .
We live in an incredibly busy world .
The pace of life is often frantic , our minds are always busy , and we &apos;re always doing something .
So with that in mind , I &apos;d like you just to take a moment to think , when did you last take any time to do nothing ?
Just 10 minutes , undisturbed ?
And when I say nothing , I do mean nothing .
So that &apos;s no emailing , texting , no Internet , no TV , no chatting , no eating , no reading , not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future .
Simply doing nothing .
I see a lot of very blank faces .
My thinking is , you probably have to go a long way back .
And this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
We &apos;re talking about our mind .
The mind , our most valuable and precious resource , through which we experience every single moment of our life , the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emotionally stable as individuals , and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others .
This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused , creative , spontaneous , and to perform at our very best in everything that we do .
And yet , we don &apos;t take any time out to look after it .
In fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clothes and our hair than we — okay , maybe not our hair , but you see where I &apos;m going .
The result , of course , is that we get stressed .
You know , the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round , lots of difficult , confusing emotions , and we don &apos;t really know how to deal with that , and the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we &apos;re no longer present in the world in which we live .
We miss out on the things that are most important to us , and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes , well , that &apos;s the way life is , so we &apos;ve just kind of got to get on with it .
That &apos;s really not how it has to be .
So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class .
And trust me , it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine , the sitting cross-legged on the floor , the incense , the herbal tea , the vegetarians , the whole deal , but my mom was going and I was intrigued , so I went along with her .
I &apos;d also seen a few kung fu movies , and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly , but I was very young at the time .
Now as I was there , I guess , like a lot of people , I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind .
You get stressed , you do some meditation .
I hadn &apos;t really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature , until I was about 20 , when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession , really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts , inundated with difficult emotions that I didn &apos;t know how to cope with .
Every time I sort of pushed one down , another one would just sort of pop back up again .
It was a really very stressful time .
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways .
Some people will bury themselves in work , grateful for the distraction .
Others will turn to their friends , their family , looking for support .
Some people hit the bottle , start taking medication .
My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk .
So I quit my degree , I headed off to the Himalayas , I became a monk , and I started studying meditation .
People often ask me what I learned from that time .
Well , obviously it changed things .
Let &apos;s face it , becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things .
But it was more than that .
It taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation , an understanding for the present moment .
By that I mean not being lost in thought , not being distracted , not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions , but instead learning how to be in the here and now , how to be mindful , how to be present .
I think the present moment is so underrated .
It sounds so ordinary , and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it &apos;s anything but ordinary .
There was a research paper that came out of Harvard , just recently , that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time .
Forty-seven percent .
At the same time , this sort of constant mind-wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness .
Now we &apos;re not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , dunno , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there &apos;s something we can do about it , when there &apos;s a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day , it impacts our entire life .
But we need to know how to do it .
We need an exercise . We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful .
That &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
It &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it .
And that &apos;s what these are for , in case you &apos;ve been wondering , because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts , getting rid of emotions , somehow controlling the mind , but actually it &apos;s quite different from that .
It &apos;s more about stepping back , seeing the thought clearly , witnessing it coming and going , emotions coming and going without judgment , but with a relaxed , focused mind .
So for example , right now , if I focus too much on the balls , then there &apos;s no way that I can relax and talk to you at the same time .
Equally , if I relax too much talking to you , then there &apos;s no way I can focus on the balls . I &apos;m going to drop them .
Now in life , and in meditation , there &apos;ll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense , and life starts to feel a bit like this .
It &apos;s a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
At other times , we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much , and things just become a sort of little bit like this .
Of course in meditation — — we &apos;re going to end up falling asleep .
So we &apos;re looking for a balance , a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement .
Now , what usually happens when we &apos;re learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought .
Let &apos;s say this is an anxious thought .
So everything &apos;s going fine , and then we see the anxious thought , and it &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , didn &apos;t realize I was worried about that . &quot;
You go back to it , repeat it . &quot; Oh , I am worried .
Oh , I really am worried . Wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot;
And before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxious about feeling anxious .
You know , this is crazy . We do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
If you think about the last time , I dunno , you had a wobbly tooth .
You know it &apos;s wobbly , and you know that it hurts .
But what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
It does hurt . And we reinforce the storyline , right ?
And we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time . And it &apos;s only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind .
But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way , you might see many different patterns .
You might find a mind that &apos;s really restless and -- the whole time .
Don &apos;t be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that .
You might find a mind that &apos;s very dull and boring , and it &apos;s just , almost mechanical , it just seems it &apos;s as if you &apos;re getting up , going to work , eat , sleep , get up , work .
Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round and round your mind .
Well , whatever it is , meditation offers the opportunity , the potential to step back and to get a different perspective , to see that things aren &apos;t always as they appear .
We can &apos;t change every little thing that happens to us in life , but we can change the way that we experience it .
That &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
You don &apos;t have to burn any incense , and you definitely don &apos;t have to sit on the floor .
All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back , to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus , calm and clarity in your life .
Thank you very much .
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
I grew up in Mobile , Alabama -- somebody &apos;s got to be from Mobile , right ? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers , forming this beautiful delta .
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor .
It &apos;s an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you &apos;re a kid interested in animals , to grow up in .
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay , and finally into the Gulf of Mexico .
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six .
I was in the gulf , and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .
And I reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility .
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand .
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature .
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors , just pulsing all of these colors .
And as I looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .
I &apos;m going , &quot; My gosh ! &quot; I had never seen anything like this in my life !
So I marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down .
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing : It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh ! -- vanished right before my eyes .
And I knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that I want to learn more about . So I did .
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology , and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii .
And while a student at Hawaii , I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium .
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , I thought , well I &apos;ll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display .
Now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they didn &apos;t really interact with people .
But the octopus did .
If you walked up to an octopus tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arrived , the octopus would rise up and look at you and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Is that guy really looking at me ? He is looking at me ! &quot;
And you walk up to the front of the tank . Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities : Some of them would hold their ground , others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks , and one in particular , this amazing animal ...
I went up to the front of the tank , and he &apos;s just staring at me , and he had little horns come up above his eyes .
So I went right up to the front of the tank -- I was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch , a little rock , and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass .
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time I could actually focus that close ; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone .
Anyway , there we were , staring at each other , and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system , and -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down .
He reaches up , takes another armful of gravel , releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- same thing .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm .
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race , because I was out and he had six left .
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing , which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate .
So , about three years into my degree , a funny thing happened on the way to the office , which actually changed the course of my life .
A man came into the aquarium . It &apos;s a long story , but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him , and as we left , he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras .
He said , &quot; Make a movie about this expedition . &quot;
&quot; OK , a couple of biologists making a movie -- this &apos;ll be interesting , &quot; and off we went . And we did , we made a movie , which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making , but it was a blast . I had so much fun .
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , &quot; Wait a minute .
Maybe I can do this all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot;
So I literally came back from that job , quit school , hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
It &apos;s been a good ride .
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial .
If you &apos;re a wildlife filmmaker and you &apos;re going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors .
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field , as a filmmaker making films with them , where you &apos;re allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals , seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes .
I remember I took a trip to Australia , went to an island called One Tree Island .
And apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree , between the time they named it and the time I arrived , because I &apos;m sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .
Anyway , one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef .
In fact , there &apos;s a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth , twice a day , pretty rapidly .
And there &apos;s a beautiful reef , very complex reef , with lots of animals , including a lot of octopus .
And not uniquely but certainly , the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage .
there &apos;s one right there .
So our first challenge was to find these things , and that was a challenge , indeed .
But the idea is , we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them .
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could , every day a little closer , a little closer , a little closer .
And you knew what the limit was : they would start getting twitchy and you &apos;d back up , come back in a few hours .
And after the first week , they ignored us .
It was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know what that thing is , but he &apos;s no threat to me . &quot;
So they went on about their business and from a foot away , we &apos;re watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience .
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior .
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging , but this particular one used vision .
And they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head .
And I don &apos;t know whether they actually saw crab in it , or imagined that one might be , but whatever the case , they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head , and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head , and they would fish out , swim for crabs .
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out .
And I always wondered what happened under that web .
So we created a way to find out , and I got my first look at that famous beak in action .
It was fantastic .
If you &apos;re going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that &apos;s fairly common .
And octopus are , they live in all the oceans .
They also live deep .
And I can &apos;t say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep , but whatever the case , I like that .
It &apos;s like nothing you &apos;ve ever done .
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen , and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen , get in a sub .
You climb in , seal the hatch , turn on a little oxygen , turn on the scrubber , which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe , and they chuck you overboard .
Down you go . There &apos;s no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio .
And as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down .
And it gets quiet .
And it starts getting really nice .
And as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .
And finally , it &apos;s a rich lavender , and after a couple of thousand feet , it &apos;s ink black .
And now you &apos;ve entered the realm of the mid-water community .
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water .
Suffice to say though , as far as I &apos;m concerned , without question , the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community .
But we &apos;re just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range , 40,000 miles long , snaking around the entire globe .
And they &apos;re big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like Hawaii .
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart , creating a rift valley .
And when you dive into that rift valley , that &apos;s where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range .
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals , reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone .
In fact , this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings .
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .
So it immediately cools , and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it &apos;s dissolved , and it precipitates out , forming black smoke .
And it forms these towers , these chimneys that are 10 , 20 , 30 feet tall .
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life .
You &apos;ve got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long .
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes .
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals : shrimp , fish , lobsters , crab , clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold .
And this whole ecosystem wasn &apos;t even known about until 33 years ago .
And it completely threw science on its head .
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun .
And before the discovery of these vents , all life on Earth , the key to life on Earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis .
But down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ; it &apos;s chemosynthetic environment down there driving it , and it &apos;s all so ephemeral .
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent , which you think at the time has to be on another planet .
It &apos;s amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment .
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
There &apos;s no hot water .
All of the animals are gone , they &apos;re dead , and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town , an eerie , spooky ghost town , but essentially devoid of animals , of course .
But 10 miles down the ridge ...
pshhh ! There &apos;s another volcano going .
And there &apos;s a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge .
And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that I &apos;ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay .
And you go back , and I &apos;m at home , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Okay , what can I shoot ...
Ah ! I know where I can shoot that .
There &apos;s this beautiful bay , lots of soft corals and stomatopods . &quot;
And you show up , and it &apos;s dead .
There &apos;s no coral , algae growing on it , and the water &apos;s pea soup .
You think , &quot; Well , what happened ? &quot;
And you turn around , and there &apos;s a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in , and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth .
And over here there &apos;s a golf course going in .
And this is the tropics .
It &apos;s raining like crazy here .
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals , fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there &apos;s your pea soup .
But , encouragingly , I &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
I &apos;ve been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay .
And I looked at it , just said , &quot; Yuck , &quot; and go and work on the other side of the island .
Five years later , come back , and that same bay is now gorgeous . It &apos;s beautiful .
It &apos;s got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go , &quot; How did that happen ? &quot;
Well , how it happened is the local community galvanized .
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it ; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay , and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay , and the bay recovered .
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover , if we &apos;ll just leave it alone .
I think Margaret Mead said it best .
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world .
Indeed , it &apos;s the only thing that ever has .
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
I &apos;m a big fan of grassroots organizations .
I &apos;ve been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , &quot; But , but what can I do ?
I &apos;m an individual . I &apos;m one person .
And these problems are so large and global , and it &apos;s just overwhelming . &quot;
Fair enough question .
My answer to that is don &apos;t look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
Look in your own backyard .
Look in your heart , actually .
What do you really care about that isn &apos;t right where you live ?
And fix it .
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same .
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
And in fact , the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in China , and the Kiwis did this , and then over in England they tried to ...
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it &apos;s not isolated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
And maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
So that &apos;s how I answer that question .
Look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror .
What can you do that is more responsible than what you &apos;re doing now ?
And do that , and spread the word .
The vent community animals can &apos;t really do much about the life and death that &apos;s going on where they live , but up here we can .
In theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment , like those people changed the health of that bay .
Now , Sylvia &apos;s TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pricks , but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation , &quot; hope spots , &quot; she calls them .
And I applaud that . I loudly applaud that .
And it &apos;s my hope that some of these &quot; hope spots &quot; can be in the deep ocean , an area that has historically been seriously neglected , if not abused .
The term &quot; deep six &quot; comes to mind : &quot; If it &apos;s too big or too toxic for a landfill , deep six it ! &quot;
So , I hope that we can also keep some of these &quot; hope spots &quot; in the deep sea .
Now , I don &apos;t get a wish , but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle &apos;s wish .
And that I do .
Thank you very much .
Mockingbirds are badass .
They are .
Mockingbirds -- that &apos;s Mimus polyglottos -- are the emcees of the animal kingdom .
They listen and mimic and remix what they like .
They rock the mic outside my window every morning .
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring .
I mean , if you can talk it , a mockingbird can squawk it .
So check it , I &apos;m gonna to catch mockingbirds .
I &apos;m going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails .
Yeah . And as I drive through a neighborhood , say , where people got-a-lotta , I &apos;ll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain &apos;t got nada and just let it go , you know .
Up goes the bird , out come the words , &quot; Juanito , Juanito , vente a comer mi hijo ! &quot;
Oh , I &apos;m going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound .
Cruising random city streets , rocking a drop-top Cadillac with a big backseat , packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds , and I &apos;ll get everybody .
I &apos;ll get the nitwit on the network news saying , &quot; We &apos;ll be back in a moment with more on the crisis . &quot;
I &apos;ll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .
I &apos;ll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is .
I &apos;ll get your postman making dinner plans .
I &apos;ll get the last time you lied .
I &apos;ll get , &quot; Baby , just give me the frickin &apos; TV guide . &quot;
I &apos;ll get a lonely , little sentence with real error in it , &quot; Yeah , I guess I could come inside , but only for a minute . &quot;
I &apos;ll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning &quot; It &apos;s Raining , It &apos;s Pouring . &quot;
I &apos;ll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring .
I &apos;ll get your ex-lover telling someone else , &quot; Good morning . &quot;
I &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mornings .
I don &apos;t care how you make &apos; em .
Aloha . Konichiwa . Shalom . Ah-Salam Alaikum .
Everybody means everybody , means everybody here .
And so maybe I &apos;ll build a gilded cage .
I &apos;ll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
Inside it , I will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation , hippie parents .
What does a violin have to do with technology ?
Where in the world is this world heading ?
On one end , gold bars -- on the other , an entire planet .
We are 12 billion light years from the edge .
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely , but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America because countries are beginning to eat like us , live like us and die like us .
You might wanna avert your gaze , because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb , and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing .
There &apos;s about 10 million phage per job .
It &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanotube .
Women can talk ; black men ski ; white men build strong buildings ; we build strong suns .
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes , and here we are , right in the middle .
It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn .
When all the little mockingbirds fly away , they &apos;re going to sound like the last four days .
I will get uptown gurus , downtown teachers , broke-ass artists and dealers , and Filipino preachers , leaf blowers , bartenders , boob-job doctors , hooligans , garbage men , your local Congressmen in the spotlight , guys in the overhead helicopters .
Everybody gets heard .
Everybody gets this one , honest mockingbird as a witness .
And I &apos;m on this .
I &apos;m on this &apos; til the whole thing spreads , with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing , &quot; Hush , little baby , don &apos;t say a word .
Wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot;
Yeah . And then come the news crews , and the man-in-the-street interviews , and the letters to the editor .
Everybody asking , just who is responsible for this citywide , nationwide mockingbird cacophony , and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey , California off to me , and they &apos;ll offer me a key to the city .
A gold-plated , oversized key to the city and that is all I need , &apos; cause if I get that , I can unlock the air .
I &apos;ll listen for what &apos;s missing , and I &apos;ll put it there .
Thank you , TED .
Wow .
Wow .
Hello ! My name is Golan Levin .
I &apos;m an artist and an engineer , which is , increasingly , a more common kind of hybrid .
But I still fall into this weird crack where people don &apos;t seem to understand me .
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture .
It &apos;s a letter from &quot; Artforum &quot; in 1967 saying &quot; We can &apos;t imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art . &quot; And they still haven &apos;t .
And lest you think that you all , as the digerati , are more enlightened , I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day .
Where &apos;s art ? I got productivity . I got sports .
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone , which my friends and I are doing now , is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .
So , from both directions , there is kind of , I think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day , which I think artists are obliged to do , is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have .
In my own case , I &apos;m an artist , and I &apos;m really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action , and basically empowering people through interactivity .
I want people to discover themselves as actors , as creative actors , by having interactive experiences .
A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this .
This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine .
And when I say desktop , I don &apos;t just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk .
If you look carefully , you can even see a hint of the Apple menu , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .
So this is , as Joy Mountford once said , &quot; The mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through . &quot;
And the thing I &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences , not necessarily utilitarian ones .
So I write software . And that &apos;s how I do it .
And a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .
Because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency .
By saying &quot; Who is that person in the mirror ? Oh it &apos;s actually me . &quot;
And so , to give an example , this is a project from last year , which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor .
And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they &apos;re just going about their everyday business .
So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth , or with each other , these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air -- basically taking what &apos;s often this , kind of , unseen space , or this undetected space , and making it something real , that people then can appreciate and become creative with .
So again , people discover their creative agency in this way .
And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways .
So in addition to using full-body input , something that I &apos;ve explored now , for a while , has been the use of the voice , which is an immensely expressive system for us , vocalizing .
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .
And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler , the so-called father of gestalt psychology , from 1927 , who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes .
And he said one of them is called Maluma .
And one of them is called Taketa . Which is which ?
Anyone want to hazard a guess ?
Maluma is on top . Yeah . So .
As he says here , most people answer without any hesitation .
So what we &apos;re really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia , which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have .
And so , whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
It &apos;s about mappings between different perceptual domains , like hardness , sharpness , brightness and darkness , and the phonemes that we &apos;re able to speak with .
So 70 years on , there &apos;s been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which , you know , L , M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this , and P , T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this .
And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
So it occurred to me , what happens if we could run these backwards ?
And thus was born the project called Remark , which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman and the Ars Electronica Futurelab .
And this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows .
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
And as you do , you see the shadows of your own speech .
And they sort of fly away , out of your head .
If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you &apos;re saying , then it spells it out .
And if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
So let &apos;s bring up a video of that .
Thanks . So . And this project here , I was working with the great abstract vocalist , Jaap Blonk .
And he is a world expert in performing &quot; The Ursonate , &quot; which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem by Kurt Schwitters , written in the 1920s , which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense .
And it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it .
And in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
So these are our live subtitles , that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of &quot; The Ursonate &quot; -- fortunately Jaap does too , very well -- and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is .
So all the text you &apos;re going to see is real-time generated by the computer , visualizing what he &apos;s doing with his voice .
Here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him .
Okay . So ...
The full videos are online if you are interested .
I got a split reaction to that during the live performance , because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron , because usually there is someone making them afterwards .
And then a bunch of people who were like , &quot; What &apos;s the big deal ?
I see subtitles all the time on television . &quot;
You know ? They don &apos;t imagine the person in the booth , typing it all .
So in addition to the full body , and in addition to the voice , another thing that I &apos;ve been really interested in , most recently , is the use of the eyes , or the gaze , in terms of how people relate to each other .
It &apos;s a really profound amount of nonverbal information that &apos;s communicated with the eyes .
And it &apos;s one of the most interesting technical challenges that &apos;s very currently active in the computer sciences : being able to have a camera that can understand , from a fairly big distance away , how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you &apos;re interested in , and where your attention is directed .
So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
And so I &apos;ve been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
And basically to ask the questions : What if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
How could it respond , in a way , to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we &apos;re looking at it ?
And what could it do if it could look back at us ?
And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
In the first one which I &apos;m going to show you , called Eyecode , it &apos;s a piece of interactive software in which , if we read this little circle , &quot; the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer . &quot;
The idea is that it &apos;s an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation .
So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .
So let &apos;s run this and see if it works .
Okay . Ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
There is just a little test screen that shows that it &apos;s working .
And what I &apos;m just going to do is -- I &apos;m going to hide that .
And you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time I blink .
Hello ? And I can ... hello ... okay .
And no matter where I am , what &apos;s really going on here is that it &apos;s an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .
And if I get really far away I &apos;m blurry .
You know , you &apos;re going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way .
But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice crisp eyes .
You can think of it as a way of , sort of , typing , with your eyes .
And what you &apos;re typing are recordings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peoples &apos; eyes .
So each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at , as you see who &apos;s looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .
So I &apos;ll just add a couple more . Blink . Blink .
And you can see , just once again , how it &apos;s sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it &apos;s blinking .
Alright . Let &apos;s leave that .
So that &apos;s this kind of recursive observation system .
Thank you .
The last couple pieces I &apos;m going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics -- for me , new for me .
It &apos;s called Opto-Isolator .
And I &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . Okay .
In this case , the Opto-Isolator is blinking in response to one &apos;s own blinks .
So it blinks one second after you do .
This is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials .
Just one eye , looking at you , and eliminating everything else about a face , but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of , as an element .
And at the same time , it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors .
Like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy , or things like that .
Okay . So the last project I &apos;m going to show is this new one called Snout .
It &apos;s an eight-foot snout , with a googly eye .
And inside it &apos;s got an 800-pound robot arm that I borrowed , from a friend .
It helps to have good friends .
I &apos;m at Carnegie Mellon ; we &apos;ve got a great Robotics Institute there .
I &apos;d like to show you thing called Snout , which is -- The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it &apos;s continually surprised to see you .
The idea is that basically -- if it &apos;s constantly like &quot; Huh ? ... Huh ? &quot;
That &apos;s why its other name is Doubletaker , Taker of Doubles .
It &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; What ? &quot;
And the idea is basically , can it look at you and make you feel as if like , &quot; What ? Is it my shoes ? &quot;
&quot; Got something on my hair ? &quot; Here we go . Alright .
Checking him out ...
For you nerds , here &apos;s a little behind-the-scenes .
It &apos;s got a computer vision system , and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most .
Those are its targets .
Up there is the skeleton , which is actually what it &apos;s trying to do .
It &apos;s really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature .
Hollywood does this all the time , of course .
But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you , and it &apos;s interested in looking at you .
Thank you very much . That &apos;s all I &apos;ve got for today .
And I &apos;m really happy to be here . Thank you so much .
I &apos;d like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .
Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
It &apos;s a woodworking machine , or at least a piece of one , and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern , a little bit easier to use .
I thought , at the time , I did a pretty good job .
Unfortunately , not very long afterwards the company went out of business .
This is the second project that I did . It &apos;s a fax machine .
I put an attractive shell around some new technology .
Again , 18 months later , the product was obsolete .
And now , of course , the whole technology is obsolete .
Now , I &apos;m a fairly slow learner , but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn &apos;t all that important -- making things more attractive , making them a bit easier to use , making them more marketable .
By focusing on a design , maybe just a single product , I was being incremental and not having much of an impact .
But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon , and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism .
So when we talk about design today , and particularly when we read about it in the popular press , we &apos;re often talking about products like these .
Amusing ? Yes . Desirable ? Maybe .
Important ? Not so very .
But this wasn &apos;t always the way .
And I &apos;d like to suggest that if we take a different view of design , and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach , that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact .
Now this gentleman , Isambard Kingdom Brunel , designed many great things in his career in the 19th century , including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe .
Both great designs and actually very innovative too .
His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford .
It &apos;s called the Great Western Railway .
And as a kid I grew up very close to here , and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past .
You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner &apos;s painting , &quot; Rain , Steam and Speed &quot; .
Now , what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
Now , this was back in the 19th century .
And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at Box , in Wiltshire .
But he didn &apos;t stop there . He didn &apos;t stop with just trying to design the best railway journey .
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York .
One journey from London to New York .
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey .
Now , Brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession , but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations .
Now , design thinking begins with what Roger Martin , the business school professor at the University of Toronto , calls integrative thinking .
And that &apos;s the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions .
In the case of design , that means balancing desirability , what humans need , with technical feasibility , and economic viability .
With innovations like the Great Western , we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit .
So somehow , we went from this to this .
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world , to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things .
As our industrial society matured , so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics , image and fashion .
Now I &apos;m not trying to throw stones here .
I &apos;m a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses .
There we go .
But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again .
And that &apos;s happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems -- to global warming , to education , healthcare , security , clean water , whatever .
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful .
And I &apos;d like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
The first of those is that design is human-centered .
It may integrate technology and economics , but it starts with what humans need , or might need .
What makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
What makes technology useful and usable ?
But that is more than simply good ergonomics , putting the buttons in the right place .
It &apos;s often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas .
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India , they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents .
Conversion Sound has developed a high quality , ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world .
Now , in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids .
In places like India , those technicians simply don &apos;t exist .
So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .
Instead of starting with technology , the team started with people and culture .
So if human need is the place to start , then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making .
Instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
Now , prototypes speed up the process of innovation , because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses .
And the faster we do that , the faster our ideas evolve .
Now , much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai , India .
They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot .
Now , they are very efficient , but they are also very innovative .
When I visited them a few years ago , what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early .
This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .
They make their own intraocular lenses .
These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts .
And I think it &apos;s partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough .
Because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory , they used the basement of one of their hospitals .
And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost CAD / CAM prototyping technology .
They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory .
So if human need is the place to start , and prototyping , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the destination .
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation -- the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and profitable .
So I &apos;d like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about , this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things , and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems , in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured , is going to be the major theme , not only for design , but also for our economy as we go forward .
So William Beveridge , when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942 , created what became Britain &apos;s welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being .
By the time he wrote his third report , he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers .
Hilary Cottam , Charlie Leadbeater , and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation , and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0 , they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state .
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle , they worked with residents in Southwark , South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year .
We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it &apos;s taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone .
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience , and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift .
Through a program of observational research , brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping , they &apos;ve developed a completely new way to change shift .
They went from retreating to the nurse &apos;s station to discuss the various states and needs of patients , to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients , using a simple software tool .
By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes , on average .
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they &apos;re being applied to .
But I &apos;d like to go back to Brunel here , and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now , and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool .
And that connection is change .
In times of change we need new alternatives , new ideas .
Now , Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution , when all of life and our economy was being reinvented .
Now the industrial systems of Brunel &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
But , again , we are in the midst of massive change .
And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society -- how we keep ourselves healthy , how we govern ourselves , how we educate ourselves , how we keep ourselves secure .
And in these times of change , we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete .
So why design thinking ?
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems .
Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives , it encourages us to take a divergent approach , to explore new alternatives , new solutions , new ideas that have not existed before .
But before we go through that process of divergence , there is actually quite an important first step .
And that is , what is the question that we &apos;re trying to answer ?
What &apos;s the design brief ?
Now Brunel may have asked a question like this , &quot; How do I take a train from London to New York ? &quot;
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
So these are some that we &apos;ve been asked to think about recently .
And one in particular , is one that we &apos;re working on with the Acumen Fund , in a project that &apos;s been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world &apos;s poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate , we took a sort of more open , collaborative and participative approach .
We teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across India .
And through workshops they developed innovative new products , services , and business models .
We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas .
So they developed and iterated these ideas .
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns , community outreach strategies , business models , new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water .
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market .
And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa .
So for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career .
That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly , by getting the process out of the hands of designers , and by getting the active participation of the community , we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions .
And just like Brunel , by focusing on systems , we can have a bigger impact .
So that &apos;s one thing that we &apos;ve been working on .
I &apos;m actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?
And if you &apos;ve got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to Twitter .
There is a hash tag there that you can use , # CBDQ .
And the list looked something like this a little while ago .
And of course you can search to find the questions that you &apos;re interested in by using the same hash code .
So I &apos;d like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products .
To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design , more like Brunel , less a domain of a professional priesthood .
And the first step is to start asking the right questions .
Thank you very much .
This is your conference , and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now , in this transition period , about this guy who &apos;s going to be looking after it for you for a bit .
So , I &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
Two years ago at TED , I think -- I &apos;ve come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion .
I think that I may have believed unconsciously , then , that I was kind of a business hero .
I had this company that I &apos;d spent 15 years building . It &apos;s called Future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars , a number I didn &apos;t really understand .
A magazine I &apos;d recently launched called Business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory , busy pumping hot air into the bubble .
And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more .
And all this had come from nothing .
Fifteen years earlier , I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said , &quot; I really would like to start my own computer magazine . &quot;
And 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times .
The date was February 2000 .
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore &apos;s Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever .
I mean , it had to . Right ? I was in for quite a surprise .
The dotcom , ironically called Snowball , was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded , and I entered 18 months of business hell .
I watched everything that I &apos;d built crumbling , and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing .
And it was gut wrenching .
It took eight years of blood , sweat and tears to reach 350 employees , something which I was very proud of in the business .
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people , and before the bloodshed was finished , 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies . I felt sick .
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day , every day , for 18 months .
And worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead : &quot; LOSER . &quot;
And I think what disgusts me more than anything , looking back , is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing ?
Well , in the end , we were able to save Future and Snowball , but I was , at that point , ready to move on .
And to cut a long story short , here &apos;s where I came to .
And the reason I &apos;m telling this story is that I believe , from many conversations , that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster -- emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years .
This has been a big , big transition time , and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever &apos;s next .
The theme next year is re-birth .
It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED .
And at about the same time , and I think partly because of that , I started doing something that I &apos;d forgotten about in my business focus : I started to read again .
And I discovered that while I &apos;d been busy playing business games , there &apos;d been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest : cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed .
And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected .
It &apos;s connected ; it all hooks into each other .
We talk about this a lot , and I thought about trying to give an example of this . So , just one example : Madame de Gaulle , the wife of the French president , was famously asked once , &quot; What do you most desire ? &quot;
And she answered , &quot; A penis . &quot;
And when you think about it , it &apos;s very true : what we all most desire is a penis -- or &quot; happiness &quot; as we say in English .
And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room .
But something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
You can ask about what causes it biochemically : neuroscience , serotonin , all that stuff .
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it : nature ? Nurture ? Current circumstance ?
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .
You can view it as a computing problem , an artificial intelligence problem : do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly ?
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say , why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness , and whereas almost all the rest of them , regardless of how much money they have -- whether it &apos;s two dollars a day or whatever -- are almost equally happy on average ?
Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing : did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways ? The ant &apos;s brain , parasitized , to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate ?
Are we the victims of a mass delusion ?
And so on , and so on .
To understand even something as important to us as happiness , you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions , and there &apos;s nowhere that I &apos;ve discovered -- other than TED -- where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions .
And so , it &apos;s the profound thing that Richard talks about : to understand anything , you just need to understand the little bits ; a little bit about everything that surrounds it .
And so , gradually over these three days , you start off kind of trying to figure out , &quot; Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff ? &quot;
And at the end of the four days , your brain is humming and you feel energized , alive and excited , and it &apos;s because all these different bits have been put together .
It &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ...
it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body massage .
Every mental organ addressed . It really is .
Enough of the theory , Chris . Tell us what you &apos;re actually going to do , all right ?
So , I will . Here &apos;s the vision for TED .
Number one : do nothing . This thing ain &apos;t broke , so I ain &apos;t gonna fix it .
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me , &quot; Chris , TED is a really great conference .
You &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot;
So , I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason , and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with .
Truth , curiosity , diversity , no selling , no corporate bullshit , no bandwagoning , no platforms .
Just the pursuit of interest , wherever it lies , across all the disciplines that are represented here .
That &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
Number two : I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year .
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines .
There &apos;s a year to do this , and already -- I hope to show you a bit later -- there &apos;s 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year .
And I &apos;m getting fantastic help from the community ; this is just such a great community . And combined , our contacts reach pretty much everyone who &apos;s interesting in the country , if not the planet .
It &apos;s true .
Number three : I do want to , if I can , find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit .
And one key way that we &apos;re going to do this is to introduce this book club .
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years , and that &apos;s a gift that I would like to pass on .
So , when you sign up for TED2003 , every six weeks you &apos;ll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they &apos;re linked to TED .
They may well be by a TED speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
I think it will be great .
And then , fourthly : I want to mention the Sapling Foundation , which is the new owner of TED .
What Sapling &apos;s ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for .
And more important , I think , the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use , because there &apos;s fantastic synergy .
Already , just in the last few days , we &apos;ve had so many people talking about stuff that they care about , that they &apos;re passionate about , that can make a difference in the world , and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in , the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will , over time , make a difference .
I &apos;m incredibly excited about that .
In fact , I don &apos;t think , overall , that I &apos;ve been as excited by anything ever in my life .
I &apos;m in this for the long run , and I would be greatly honored and excited if you &apos;ll come on this journey with me .
In the 17th century , a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business .
For over 50 years she ran it .
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — — for murdering 600 men . You see , it wasn &apos;t a very good perfume .
In fact , it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless , but as a poison , it was the best money could buy , so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands .
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group , because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing .
The reason is , we have sort of a built-in poison detector .
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants .
If you are willing to do this , you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance , and you &apos;ll see that face , the tongue stick out , the wrinkled nose , as if they &apos;re trying to get rid of what &apos;s in their mouth .
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response , no longer just about whether or not we &apos;re about to be poisoned , but whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical contamination from some source . But the face remains strikingly similar .
It has expanded more , though , than just keeping us away from physical contaminants , and there &apos;s a growing body of evidence to suggest that , in fact , this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions .
Why this might be the case ?
We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general . So the basic human emotions , those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings , exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things .
So by and large , they are good for our survival .
Take the emotion of fear , for instance . It keeps us away from doing things that are really , really risky .
This photo taken just before his death — — is actually a — No , one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this , and if they did , they would not live to tell it , because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator .
Just like fear offers us protective benefits , disgust seems to do the same thing , except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us , or heights , but rather things that might poison us , or give us disease and make us sick .
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it &apos;s very , very easy to elicit , in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions , and so I &apos;m going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust .
So turn away . I &apos;ll tell you when you can turn back .
I mean , you see it every day , right ? I mean , come on .
Okay , turn back , if you didn &apos;t look .
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very , very disgusted , but if you didn &apos;t look , I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted , things like feces , urine , blood , rotten flesh .
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from , because they might actually contaminate us .
In fact , just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts , these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust .
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions , and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response .
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America .
&quot; In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
and plainly showed disgust at its softness , whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — — though his hands did not appear dirty . &quot;
He later wrote , &quot; It &apos;s okay , some of my best friends are naked savages . &quot;
Well it turns out it &apos;s not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish . I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary , and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times . Here &apos;s my favorite .
Richard Dawkins : &quot; We &apos;ve evolved around courtship and sex , are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight . &quot;
David Pizarro : So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged .
He jumps back , and he gags , and we had to do it three times , and all three times he gagged .
And he was really gagging . I thought he might throw up on me , actually .
One of the features , though , of disgust , is not just its universality and its strength , but the way that it works through association .
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing , that clean thing becomes disgusting , not the other way around .
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided .
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote : &quot; Thus throughout history , certain disgust properties -- sliminess , bad smell , stickiness , decay , foulness -- have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
Jews , women , homosexuals , untouchables , lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body . &quot;
Let me give you just some examples of how , some powerful examples of how this has been used historically .
This comes from a Nazi children &apos;s book published in 1938 : &quot; Just look at these guys ! The louse-infested beards , the filthy , protruding ears , those stained , fatty clothes ...
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor .
If you have a good nose , you can smell the Jews . &quot;
A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral .
This is from an anti-gay website , where they said gays are &quot; worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices . &quot;
They &apos;re like &quot; dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces . &quot;
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like .
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment , one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted .
So while disgust , along with the other basic emotions , are universal phenomena , it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others .
You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images .
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust .
So here are a couple of examples .
&quot; Even if I were hungry , I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter . &quot;
&quot; Do you agree or disagree ? &quot;
&quot; While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track , you smell urine . Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted ? &quot;
If you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful .
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they &apos;re willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that &apos;s been baked to look like dog poop , or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross , your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you &apos;ll be willing to engage in those behaviors .
The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs , we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom -- that in fact , across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative .
Another way to say this , though , is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust .
In a more recent follow-up study , we were able to look at a much greater sample , a much larger sample . In this case , this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents , and we find the same pattern . As you can see , people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they &apos;re easily disgusted .
This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity .
So we were able to control for gender , age , income , education , even basic personality variables , and the result stays the same .
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation , but voting behavior , we were able to look geographically across the nation . What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity , McCain got more votes .
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation , but actual voting behavior . And also we were able , with this sample , to look across the world , in 121 different countries we asked the same questions , and as you can see , this is 121 countries collapsed into 10 different geographical regions .
No matter where you look , what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation , and no matter where we looked , we saw a very similar effect .
Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity , so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are , they hook people up to physiological measures , in this case skin conductance .
And what they &apos;ve demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you .
Interestingly , what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative , but they &apos;re also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain .
So physiological arousal predicted , in this study , attitudes toward gay marriage .
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation , one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here ? Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs ?
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this , and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn &apos;t been disgusted . It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this , and by and large the results have all been the same , that when people are feeling disgust , their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum , toward more moral conservatism as well .
So this is whether you use a foul odor , a bad taste , from film clips , from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust , images like the ones I &apos;ve shown you , even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up , right , to keep clean , these all have similar effects on judgment .
Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
When the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
Disgust didn &apos;t influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked , including African-Americans , the elderly . It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men .
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands .
For some participants , we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands .
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative .
And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts , what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative .
In particular , when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices , just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong .
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice . We gave them scenarios .
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother .
When his grandmother &apos;s away , he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma &apos;s bed .
In another one , we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her .
People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they &apos;ve been reminded to wash their hands .
Okay . The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise . I mean , that &apos;s part of how emotions work .
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways , but they change the way you think .
In the case of disgust , what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence . It makes perfect sense , and it &apos;s a very good emotion for us to have , that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible .
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I &apos;m going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election .
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is , at the very least , what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place .
Thank you .
Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque ?
Probably not , but people like me do .
I &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich , and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
And through this work , I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human DNA from ancient bones .
And from these extracts , we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations , risk factors and inherited diseases .
But this is only one half of the story .
The most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
All of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved .
And in order to understand these diseases , we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past .
But there are a lot of challenges for this .
And first of all , what do we even study ?
Skeletons are ubiquitous ; they &apos;re found all over the place .
But of course , all of the soft tissue has decomposed , and the skeleton itself has limited health information .
Mummies are a great source of information , except that they &apos;re really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
Coprolites are fossilized human feces , and they &apos;re actually extremely interesting .
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
So to address this problem , I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland , Denmark and the U.K.
to study a very poorly studied , little known material that &apos;s found on people everywhere .
It &apos;s a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
Many of you may know it by the term tartar .
It &apos;s what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit .
And in a typical dentistry visit , you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed .
But in ancient times before tooth brushing , up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime .
And what &apos;s really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton , it &apos;s abundant in quantity before the present day and it &apos;s ubiquitous worldwide .
We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years .
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals .
And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy .
They &apos;d looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they &apos;d found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
And so what my team of researchers , what we wanted to do , is say , can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins , and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what &apos;s going on ?
And what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth .
We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet .
But what was surprising to us , and also quite exciting , is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems .
So it gives us virtual access to the lungs , which is where many important diseases reside .
And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
And so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that , from the skeleton alone , has long decomposed .
And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity thousands of years ago .
So what started out as an idea , is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens .
And from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick .
And I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
And as a final parting thought , on behalf of future archeologists , I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth .
Thank you .
It &apos;s an amazing thing that we &apos;re here to talk about the year of patients rising .
You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , &quot; You know what , I know what the odds are , but I &apos;m going to go look for more information .
I &apos;m going to define what the terms of my success are . &quot;
I &apos;m going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died -- found out I was , in fact , already almost dead .
And what I then found out about what &apos;s called the e-Patient movement -- I &apos;ll explain what that term means .
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave , and when I discovered this , I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave .
Regarding the word &quot; patient , &quot; when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who &apos;s not in the room here , somebody out there .
Some of our talks today , we still act like that .
But I &apos;m here to tell you , &quot; patient &quot; is not a third-person word .
You , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads nodding , people who say , &quot; Yes , I know exactly what you mean . &quot;
So when you hear what I &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met , all the ones I haven &apos;t met .
This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care , in fixing health care .
One of the senior doctors at my hospital , Charlie Safran , and his colleague , Warner Slack , have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient .
They have been saying that since the 1970s .
Now I &apos;m going to step back in history .
This is from July , 1969 .
I was a freshman in college , and this was when we first landed on the Moon .
And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface -- that &apos;s the place where you and I are right now , where we live .
The world was changing .
It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee .
A few weeks later , Woodstock happened .
Three days of fun and music .
Here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
Yeah , the wavy hair , the blue eyes -- it was really something .
That Fall of 1969 , the Whole Earth Catalog came out .
It was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency .
We think of hippies of being just hedonists , but there &apos;s a very strong component -- I was in that movement -- a very strong component of being responsible for yourself .
This book &apos;s title &apos;s subtitle is : &quot; Access to Tools . &quot;
And it talked about how to build your own house , how to grow your own food , all kinds of things .
In the 1980s , this young doctor , Tom Ferguson , was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog .
And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves .
In fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies .
Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information .
And when the Web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
And he coined this term e-Patients -- equipped , engaged , empowered , enabled .
Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then .
Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term .
In 2006 , I went to my doctor for a regular physical , and I had said , &quot; I have a sore shoulder . &quot;
Well , I got an X-ray , and the next morning -- you may have noticed , those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this .
This morning , some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition .
For me , it was 9 : 00 AM on January 3 , 2007 .
I was at the office ; my desk was clean ; I had the blue partition carpet on the walls .
The phone rang and it was my doctor .
He said , &quot; Dave , I pulled up the X-ray image on the screen on the computer at home . &quot;
He said , &quot; Your shoulder &apos;s going to be fine , but Dave , there &apos;s something in your lung . &quot;
And if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there .
To make a long story short , I said , &quot; So you need me to get back in there ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , we &apos;re going to need to do a CT scan of your chest . &quot;
And in parting I said , &quot; Is there anything I should do ? &quot;
He said -- think about this one .
This is the advice your doctor gives you : &quot; just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife . &quot;
I went in for the CAT scan , and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs .
So at that point we knew that it was cancer .
We knew it wasn &apos;t lung cancer .
That meant it was metastasized from somewhere .
The question was , where from ?
So I went in for an ultrasound .
I got to do what many women have -- the jelly on the belly and bzzzz .
My wife came with me .
She &apos;s a veterinarian , so she &apos;s seen lots of ultrasounds .
I mean , she knows I &apos;m not a dog .
But what we saw -- this is an MRI image .
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there .
And there were actually two of these .
One was growing out the front and it had already erupted , and it latched onto the bowel .
One was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that I &apos;d never heard of , but all of a sudden I cared about it .
I went home .
Now I &apos;ve been Googling -- I &apos;ve been online since 1989 on CompuServe .
I went home , and I know you can &apos;t read the details here ; that &apos;s not important .
My point is I went to a respected medical website , WebMD , because I know how to filter out junk .
I also found my wife online .
Before I met her , I went through some suboptimal search results .
So I looked for quality information .
There &apos;s so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ?
Where does my body end and an invader start ?
And cancer , a tumor , is something you grow out of your own tissue .
How does that happen ?
Where does medical ability end and start ?
Well , so what I read on WebMD : &quot; The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer .
Almost all patients are incurable . &quot;
I &apos;ve been online long enough to know if I don &apos;t like the first results I get , I go look for more .
And what I found was on other websites , even by the third page of Google results , &quot; Outlook is bleak &quot; , &quot; Prognosis is grim . &quot;
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; What the heck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t feel sick at all .
I mean , I &apos;d been getting tired in the evening , but I was 56 years old .
I was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
It was really something .
And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got .
Totally by coincidence , there &apos;s that thing in my lung .
In the left femur , the left thigh bone , there &apos;s another one .
I had one . My leg eventually snapped .
I fainted and landed on it , and it broke .
There &apos;s one in the skull , and then just for good measure , I had these other tumors -- including , by the time my treatment started , one was growing out of my tongue .
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue .
And what I read was that my median survival was 24 weeks .
This was bad .
I was facing the grave .
I thought , &quot; What &apos;s my mother &apos;s face going to look like on the day of my funeral ? &quot;
I had to sit down with my daughter and say , &quot; Here &apos;s the situation . &quot;
Her boyfriend was with her .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad &apos;s still alive . &quot;
It &apos;s really serious .
Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
Well , my doctor prescribed a patient community , Acor.org , a network of cancer patients , of all amazing things .
Very quickly they told me , &quot; Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease .
Get yourself to a specialist center .
There is no cure , but there &apos;s something that sometimes works -- it usually doesn &apos;t -- called high-dosage interleukin .
Most hospitals don &apos;t offer it , so they won &apos;t even tell you it exists .
And don &apos;t let them give you anything else first .
And by the way , here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers . &quot;
How amazing is that ?
Here &apos;s the thing .
Here we are , four years later : you can &apos;t find a website that gives patients that information .
Government-approved , American Cancer Society , but patients know what patients want to know .
It &apos;s the power of patient networks .
This amazing substance -- again I mentioned , where does my body end ?
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate .
And he said , &quot; You know , the immune system is good at detecting invaders -- bacteria coming from outside -- but when it &apos;s your own tissue that you &apos;ve grown , it &apos;s a whole different thing . &quot;
And I went through a mental exercise actually , because I started a patient support community of my own on a website , and one of my friends , one of my relatives actually , said , &quot; Look , Dave , who grew this thing ?
Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself ? &quot;
So we went into it .
And the story of how all that happens is in this book .
Anyway , this is the way the numbers unfolded .
Me being me , I put the numbers from my hospital &apos;s website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet .
Don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
You see , that &apos;s the immune system .
Amazing thing , those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart .
And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between .
Just incredible .
Who knows what we &apos;ll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it .
The punch line is that a year and a half later , I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married .
And when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she didn &apos;t have to say to her mother , &quot; I wish Dad could have been here . &quot;
And this is what we &apos;re doing when we make health care better .
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
This is Regina Holliday , a painter in Washington D.C. , whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease .
She &apos;s painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital .
One of the things that she discovered was that her husband &apos;s medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized .
And she thought , &quot; You know , if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box , why can &apos;t there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty , every new doctor , the basics about my husband &apos;s condition ? &quot;
So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label , something like that , in a diagram of him .
She then , last year , painted this diagram .
She studied health care like me .
She came to realize that there were a lot of people who &apos;d written patient advocate books that you just don &apos;t hear about at medical conferences .
Patients are such an underutilized resource .
Well as it says in my introduction , I &apos;ve gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data .
And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago , &quot; Give me my damn data , because you people can &apos;t be trusted to keep it clean . &quot;
And here she has our damned data -- it &apos;s a pun -- which is starting to break out , starting to break through -- the water symbolizes our data .
And in fact , I want to do a little something improvisational for you here .
There &apos;s a guy on Twitter that I know , a health IT guy outside Boston , and he wrote the e-Patient rap .
And it goes like this .
Gimme my damn data I want to be an e-Patient just like Dave Gimme my damn data , cuz it &apos;s my life to save Now I &apos;m not going to go any further .
Well thank you . That shot the timing .
Think about the possibility , why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family ?
Here &apos;s a website , VisibleBody.com , that I stumbled across .
And I thought , &quot; You know , I wonder what my soleus muscle is ? &quot;
So you can click on things and remove it .
And I saw , &quot; Aha , that &apos;s the kidney and the soleus muscle . &quot;
And I was rotating it in 3D and saying , &quot; I understand now . &quot;
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth , where you can fly to any address .
And I thought , &quot; Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body ? &quot;
What did Google come out with this year ?
Now there &apos;s Google Body browser .
But you see , it &apos;s still generic .
It &apos;s not my data .
But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it , the way software innovators like to do , who knows what we &apos;ll be able to come up with .
One final story : this is Kelly Young , a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida .
This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks .
RA patients , as they call themselves -- her blog is RA Warrior -- have a big problem because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms .
And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going .
And some doctors think , &quot; Yeah right , you &apos;re really in pain . &quot;
Well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that &apos;s usually used for cancer , but it can also reveal inflammation .
And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray .
So she took it .
And the radiologist report said , &quot; No cancer found . &quot;
Well that &apos;s not what he was supposed to do with it .
So she had it read again , she wanted to have it read again , and her doctor fired her .
She pulled up the CD .
He said , &quot; If you don &apos;t want to follow my instructions , go away . &quot;
So she pulled up the CD of the scan images , and look at all those hot spots .
And she &apos;s now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care .
See , that is an empowered patient -- no medical training .
We are , you are , the most underused resource in health care .
What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data .
How big a deal was this ?
Well at TED2009 , Tim Berners-Lee himself , inventor of the Web , gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people &apos;s articles about the data , but the raw data .
And he got them chanting by the end of the talk , &quot; Raw data now .
Raw data now . &quot;
And I ask you , three words , please , to improve health care : let patients help .
Let patients help .
Let patients help .
Let patients help .
Thank you .
For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast , God bless you , everyone -- let patients help .
And bless yourself . Thank you very much .
The murder happened a little over 21 years ago , January the 18th , 1991 , in a small bedroom community of Lynwood , California , just a few miles southeast of Los Angeles .
A father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk , to get home , finish their schoolwork , and prepare themselves for bed .
And as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and -- &quot; Bam , Bam ! &quot; -- killing the father .
And the car sped off .
The police , investigating officers , were amazingly efficient .
They considered all the usual culprits , and in less than 24 hours , they had selected their suspect : Francisco Carrillo , a 17-year-old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred .
They found photos of him . They prepared a photo array , and the day after the shooting , they showed it to one of the teenagers , and he said , &quot; That &apos;s the picture .
That &apos;s the shooter I saw that killed the father . &quot;
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to , to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder .
In the investigation that followed before the actual trial , each of the other five teenagers was shown photographs , the same photo array .
The picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots .
The reason we &apos;re not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system , but that &apos;s another whole TEDx talk for later .
So at the actual trial , all six of the teenagers testified , and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array .
He was convicted . He was sentenced to life imprisonment , and transported to Folsom Prison .
So what &apos;s wrong ?
Straightforward , fair trial , full investigation .
Oh yes , no gun was ever found .
No vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm , and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter &apos;s vehicle .
And Mr. Carrillo &apos;s alibi ?
Which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing ?
Sent to prison , adamantly insisting on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
The problems , actually , for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research involving human memory .
First of all , we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work , where we know that we have , what , 250 , 280 documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated , some from death row , on the basis of later DNA analysis , and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them .
We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible .
The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that &apos;s related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line : The brain abhors a vacuum .
Under the best of observation conditions , the absolute best , we only detect , encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us , and they &apos;re stored in different parts of the brain .
So now , when it &apos;s important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced , we have an incomplete , we have a partial store , and what happens ?
Below awareness , with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing , the brain fills in information that was not there , not originally stored , from inference , from speculation , from sources of information that came to you , as the observer , after the observation .
But it happens without awareness such that you don &apos;t , aren &apos;t even cognizant of it occurring .
It &apos;s called reconstructed memories .
It happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
It was those two considerations , among others -- reconstructed memory , the fact about the eyewitness fallibility -- that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo .
They retained me , as a forensic neurophysiologist , because I had expertise in eyewitness memory identification , which obviously makes sense for this case , right ?
But also because I have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision .
Well , what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
Well , when you read through the case materials in this Carrillo case , one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene , at the shooting .
All the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well .
But this occurred in mid-January , in the Northern Hemisphere , at 7 p.m. at night .
So when I did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on Earth at the time of the incident of the shooting , all right , it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night .
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
The only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources , and that &apos;s where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers , with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception , along with special cameras and high-speed film , right ?
Take all the measurements and record them , right ?
And then take photographs , and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting .
This is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
Remember , the investigating officers &apos; report said the lighting was good .
The teenagers said they could see very well .
This is looking down to the east , where the shooting vehicle sped off , and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers .
As you can see , it is at best poor .
No one &apos;s going to call this well-lit , good lighting , and in fact , as nice as these pictures are , and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court , and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you &apos;re trying to communicate numbers , abstract concepts like lux , the international measurement of illumination , the Ishihara color perception test values .
When you present those to people who are not well-versed in those aspects of science and that , they become salamanders in the noonday sun . It &apos;s like talking about the tangent of the visual angle , all right ?
Their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator , a good communicator , and that &apos;s part of the reason why we take the pictures , to show not only where the light sources are , and what we call the spill , the distribution , but also so that it &apos;s easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances .
So these are some of the pictures that , in fact , I used when I testified , but more importantly were , to me as a scientist , are those readings , the photometer readings , which I can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye under those circumstances , and from my readings that I recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time , so on and so forth , right , I could predict that there would be no reliable color perception , which is crucial for face recognition , and that there would be only scotopic vision , which means there would be very little resolution , what we call boundary or edge detection , and that furthermore , because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light , the depth of field , the distance at which you can focus and see details , would have been less than 18 inches away .
I testified to that to the court , and while the judge was very attentive , it had been a very , very long hearing for this petition for a retrial , and as a result , I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers .
And here I became a bit audacious , and I turned and I asked the judge , I said , &quot; Your Honor , I think you should go out and look at the scene yourself . &quot;
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — — but nonetheless , it &apos;s to this man &apos;s credit and his courage that he said , &quot; Yes , I will . &quot;
A shocker in American jurisprudence .
So in fact , we found the same identical conditions , we reconstructed the entire thing again , he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff &apos;s officers to protect him in this community , all right ?
We had him stand actually slightly in the street , so closer to the suspect vehicle , the shooter vehicle , than the actual teenagers were , so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street .
We had a car that came by , same identical car as described by the teenagers , right ?
It had a driver and a passenger , and after the car had passed the judge by , the passenger extended his hand , pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on , just as the teenagers had described it , right ?
Now , he didn &apos;t use a real gun in his hand , so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described .
He pointed by , and this is what the judge saw .
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge .
There &apos;s an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you .
That &apos;s 30 feet away .
Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
Okay . There &apos;s 15 feet .
At this point , I became a little concerned .
This judge is someone you &apos;d never want to play poker with .
He was totally stoic . I couldn &apos;t see a twitch of his eyebrow .
I couldn &apos;t see the slightest bend of his head .
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this , and after he looked at this reenactment , he turned to me and he says , &quot; Is there anything else you want me to look at ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Your honor , &quot; and I don &apos;t know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate , or whether it was just sheer stupidity , which is what the defense lawyers thought — — when they heard me say , &quot; Yes , Your Honor , I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you , three to four feet away , and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you , and you can look at it as long as you want . &quot;
And that &apos;s what he saw .
You &apos;ll notice , which was also in my test report , all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side , which means that the shooter &apos;s face would have been photo-occluded . It would have been backlit .
Furthermore , the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker .
And this is three to four feet away .
Why did I take the risk ?
I knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less .
Three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
This is what he saw .
He went back , there was a few more days of evidence that was heard . At the end of it , he made the judgment that he was going to grant the petition for a retrial .
And furthermore , he released Mr. Carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry him .
Which they decided not to .
He is now a freed man .
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law .
He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial , right ? And she had a little baby boy .
He and his son are both attending Cal State , Long Beach right now taking classes .
And what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
First of all , there &apos;s a long history of antipathy between science and the law in American jurisprudence .
I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert of just trying to get science into the courtroom .
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
One suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity , through policy , through procedures , to get more science in the courtroom , and I think one large step toward that is more requirements , with all due respect to the law schools , of science , technology , engineering , mathematics for anyone going into the law , because they become the judges .
Think about how we select our judges in this country .
It &apos;s very different than most other cultures . All right ?
The other one that I want to suggest , the caution that all of us have to have , I constantly have to remind myself , about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true , that we believe in ?
There is decades of research , examples and examples of cases like this , where individuals really , really believe . None of those teenagers who identified him thought that they were picking the wrong person .
None of them thought they couldn &apos;t see the person &apos;s face .
We all have to be very careful .
All our memories are reconstructed memories .
They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that &apos;s happened afterwards .
They &apos;re dynamic .
They &apos;re malleable . They &apos;re volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they &apos;re correct .
Thank you .
I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family .
He did it because he couldn &apos;t afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
Many of these do-it-yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century .
But now , the maker community and the open-source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they &apos;re made of back into our lives , and I believe we need to take them to the next level , to the components things are made of .
For the most part , we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced .
But now we have these amazing , futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape , paints that conduct electricity , pigments that change color , fabrics that light up .
Let me show you some examples .
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires .
In the case of this little example I &apos;m holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light .
Conductive ink has been used by artists , but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens .
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles .
What this means is that , while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges , this one illuminates across the entire surface when I turn on the lights around it .
Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature .
So I &apos;m going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens .
So one of the principle applications for this material is , amongst other things , in baby bottles , so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink .
So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials .
In a few years , they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis .
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch .
So I &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am I here today talking about smart materials ?
Well first of all , because I am a maker .
I &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of .
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities .
There &apos;s barely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced .
So for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to .
So a little over three years ago , Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials .
It &apos;s a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publish information , encourage others to contribute whenever they can , and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves .
We would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do-it-yourself information on smart materials .
But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
First of all , because we can &apos;t shape what we don &apos;t understand , and what we don &apos;t understand and use ends up shaping us .
The objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life .
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials , we should know and understand them .
Secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers .
So many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes .
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink .
Jordan Bunker , who had had no experience with chemistry until then , read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances and tools .
He used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist / maker .
Jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and didn &apos;t work , so others could study and reproduce it .
So Jordan &apos;s main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself .
And now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements .
Another example I &apos;d like to mention is Hannah Perner-Wilson &apos;s Kit-of-No-Parts .
Her project &apos;s goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder .
Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
So Hannah &apos;s approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves .
So amongst Hannah &apos;s many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites .
&#91; &quot; Paper speakers &quot; &#93; What we &apos;re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet .
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT , Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink .
Just like Jordan and so many other makers , Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them .
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
So Hannah &apos;s artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative .
So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail .
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
So the more people experiment with materials , the more researchers are willing to share their research , and manufacturers their knowledge , the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all .
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when , in the early 1970s , he wrote , &quot; You must understand computers now . &quot;
Back then , computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home .
So it &apos;s a little strange that I &apos;m standing here and saying , &quot; You must understand smart materials now . &quot;
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future .
Thank you .
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you &apos;re faced with a complex problem ?
Well , I hope to change that in less than three minutes .
So , I hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
So for me , a well-crafted baguette , fresh out of the oven , is complex , but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated .
I &apos;m an ecologist , and I study complexity . I love complexity .
And I study that in the natural world , the interconnectedness of species .
So here &apos;s a food web , or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California .
And this is what happens to that food web when it &apos;s stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before .
All the grayed-out species disappear .
Some are actually on the brink of extinction .
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos , even though they eat them .
These effects were all unanticipated , and yet we &apos;re discovering they &apos;re predictable .
So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we &apos;re learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .
First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn &apos;t think of before .
For example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park .
The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another , if you focus only on that link , and then you black box the rest , it &apos;s actually less predictable than if you step back , consider the entire system -- all the species , all the links -- and from that place , hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .
And we &apos;re discovering , with our research , that &apos;s often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees .
So the more you step back , embrace complexity , the better chance you have of finding simple answers , and it &apos;s often different than the simple answer that you started with .
So let &apos;s switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government .
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan .
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago .
Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated .
And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government .
Clearly a complex problem , but is it complicated ?
Well , when I saw this in the front page of the Times , I thought , &quot; Great . Finally something I can relate to .
I can sink my teeth into this . &quot;
So let &apos;s do it . So here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network .
The circled node is the one we &apos;re trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
And so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence .
Within that sphere , most of those nodes are not actionable , like the harshness of the terrain , and a very small minority are actual military actions .
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories : active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair , transparent economic development and provisioning of services .
I don &apos;t know about this , but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds .
When you see a diagram like this , I don &apos;t want you to be afraid .
I want you to be excited . I want you to be relieved .
Because simple answers may emerge .
We &apos;re discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity .
So for any problem , the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity , the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most .
Thank you .
When I was considering a career in the art world , I took a course in London , and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro , who drank too much , smoked too much and swore much too much .
But he was a passionate teacher , and I remember one of our earlier classes with him , he was projecting images on the wall , asking us to think about them , and he put up an image of a painting .
It was a landscape with figures , semi-dressed , drinking wine . There was a nude woman in the lower foreground , and on the hillside in the back , there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus , and he said , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
And I -- no one else did , so I put up my hand , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s a Bacchanal by Titian . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s a what ? &quot;
I thought maybe I &apos;d pronounced it wrong .
&quot; It &apos;s a Bacchanal by Titian . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s a what ? &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s a Bacchanal by Titian . &quot;
He said , &quot; You boneless bookworm !
It &apos;s a fucking orgy ! &quot;
As I said , he swore too much .
There was an important lesson for me in that .
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training , art history training , because he feared that it filled people up with jargon , and then they just classified things rather than looking at them , and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary , and he wanted us to use our eyes , and he was especially evangelical about this message , because he was losing his sight .
He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects .
What is it ? How is it made ? Why was it made ?
How is it used ?
And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian .
My kind of eureka moment came a few years later , when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe , and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day .
But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions , I found there was a kind of a missing component , for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries .
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why .
Tapestries were portable . You could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , dank interior into a richly colored setting .
Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated , or even themselves , and in addition to that , tapestries were hugely expensive .
They required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials -- the wools , the silks , even gold and silver thread .
So , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
Well , I became a tapestry historian .
In due course , I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum , because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about .
And in about 1997 , the then-director Philippe de Montebello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . We normally have these very long lead-in times .
It wasn &apos;t straightforward . It &apos;s no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car .
They have to be wound on huge rollers , shipped in oversized freighters .
Some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience : the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded ; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread ; the labeling .
You know , we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs , a one-hit image . These were big , complex things , almost like cartoons with multiple narratives .
We had to draw our audience in , get them to slow down , to explore the objects .
There was a lot of skepticism . On the opening night , I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying , &quot; This is going to be a bomb . &quot;
But in reality , in the course of the coming weeks and months , hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show .
The exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
So I want you to use your imaginations , thinking of these wall-high objects , some of them 10 meters wide , depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today , thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer , violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism .
I remember taking my son &apos;s school class . He was eight at the time , and all the little boys , they kind of -- you know , they were little boys , and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground — — kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist .
And you can just imagine them .
But it brought it alive to them . I think they suddenly saw that these weren &apos;t just old faded tapestries .
These were images of the world in the past , and that it was the same for our audience .
And for me as a curator , I felt proud . I felt I &apos;d shifted the needle a little .
Through this experience that could only be created in a museum , I &apos;d opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians , artists , press , the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium .
A few years later , I was invited to be the director of the museum , and after I got over that -- &quot; Who , me ? The tapestry geek ? I don &apos;t wear a tie ! &quot; -- I realized the fact : I believe passionately in that curated museum experience .
We live in an age of ubiquitous information , and sort of &quot; just add water &quot; expertise , but there &apos;s nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative , what the curator does , the interpretation of a complex , esoteric subject , in a way that retains the integrity of the subject , that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience .
And that , to me , today , is now the challenge and the fun of my job , supporting the vision of my curators , whether it &apos;s an exhibition of Samurai swords , early Byzantine artifacts , Renaissance portraits , or the show we heard mentioned earlier , the McQueen show , with which we enjoyed so much success last summer .
That was an interesting case .
In the late spring , early summer of 2010 , shortly after McQueen &apos;s suicide , our curator of costume , Andrew Bolton , came to see me , and said , &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking of doing a show on McQueen , and now is the moment . We have to , we have to do it fast . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t easy . McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy , but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence , and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows , which were works of performance art in their own right , and we proceeded to do something at the museum , I think , we &apos;ve never done before .
It wasn &apos;t just your standard installation .
In fact , we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings , a recreation of his first studio , a hall of mirrors , a curiosity box , a sunken ship , a burned-out interior , with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating .
And in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures .
It could have been a train wreck .
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas , but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team , he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen , and the show was quite transcendant , and it became a phenomenon in its own right .
By the end of the show , we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show , but no one really complained .
I heard over and over again , &quot; Wow , that was worth it .
It was a such a visceral , emotive experience . &quot;
Now , I &apos;ve described two very immersive exhibitions , but I also believe that collections , individual objects , can also have that same power .
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art , but of an encyclopedic museum , and today , 140 years later , that vision is as prescient as ever , because , of course , we live in a world of crisis , of challenge , and we &apos;re exposed to it through the 24 / 7 newsreels .
It &apos;s in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations , the cultures , that we &apos;re seeing the current manifestation of .
Whether it &apos;s Libya , Egypt , Syria , it &apos;s in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding .
I mean , our new Islamic galleries are a case in point , opened 10 years , almost to the week , after 9 / 11 .
I think for most Americans , knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before 9 / 11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of America &apos;s darkest hours , and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event .
Now , in our galleries , we show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread , and , again , hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October .
I &apos;m often asked , &quot; Is digital media replacing the museum ? &quot;
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion . I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong , I &apos;m a huge advocate of the Web .
It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe , but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship .
Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we &apos;re going .
The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world , awe-inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
From there , you can walk in any direction to almost any culture .
I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and I watch our visitors coming in .
Some of them are comfortable . They feel at home .
They know what they &apos;re looking for .
Others are very uneasy . It &apos;s an intimidating place .
They feel that the institution is elitist .
I &apos;m working to try and break down that sense of that elitism .
I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind , where they &apos;re prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the unfamiliar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
Because for us , it &apos;s all about bringing them face to face with great works of art , capturing them at that moment of discomfort , when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone , your Blackberry , but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand .
And whether it &apos;s in the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend , or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry , or , to bring it back to my tutor Pietro , those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine , and that nude figure in the left foreground .
Wow . She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality .
In that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
You know it &apos;s an orgy .
Thank you .
I started juggling a long time ago , but long before that , I was a golfer , and that &apos;s what I was , a golfer .
And as a golfer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores , that I sort of lived my whole life , is process .
And it &apos;s the process of learning things .
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer , but he was lefty .
And he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things .
Well , I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time , but grew to know stuff about .
And that was the mythology of skill .
So , one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill .
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I &apos;m supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music .
But Tod couldn &apos;t come and the project is sort of somewhere , I &apos;m not sure whether it &apos;s happening the way we thought , or not .
But I &apos;m going to explore skill , and juggling , and basically visual music , I guess .
OK , you can start the music , thanks .
Thanks . Thank you . Now , juggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm .
And you can turn the mike on now . I &apos;m going to do a couple of pieces .
I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it .
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet , and controlling the balls with my feet .
Thanks . Now , this next section was an attempt to explore space .
You see , I think Richard said something about people that are against something .
Well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
Well , I kind of , from my childhood and golf and all that , it &apos;s a process of joining with forces .
And so what I &apos;d like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique .
So juggling gravity -- up , down .
If you figure out what up and down really are , it &apos;s a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything , but then you add in sideways .
Now , I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes , and see with your hands because you &apos;re not looking at your hands , you &apos;re looking at where the balls are or you &apos;re looking at the audience .
So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it &apos;s also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
Thanks . So , visual music : rhythm and complexity .
I &apos;m going to build towards complexity now .
Juggling three balls is simple and normal .
Excuse me .
We &apos;re jugglers , OK . And remember , you &apos;re transposing , you &apos;re getting into a subculture here .
And juggling -- the balls cross and all that .
OK , if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights , but then hopefully even rhythm .
And you can change the rhythm -- good , Michael .
You can change the rhythm , if you get out of the lights .
OK ? Change the rhythm , so it &apos;s even .
Or you can go back and change the height . Now , skill .
But you &apos;re boxed in , if you can only do it up and down that way .
So , you &apos;ve got to go after the space down there .
OK , then you &apos;ve got to combine them , because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .
And then you get crazy .
Now , I &apos;m actually going to ask you to try something , so you &apos;ve got to pay attention . Complexity : if you spend enough time doing something , time slows down or your skill increases , so your perceptions change .
It &apos;s learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash .
Things slow down as you learn , as you learn , as you learn .
You may not be able to affect it , it almost drifts on you . It goes .
But that &apos;s the closest approximation I can have to it .
So , complexity . Now , how many here are jugglers ?
OK , so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .
OK ? And whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely , right ?
No , it looks like a mess . It looks like a mess with a guy there , who &apos;s got his hands around that mess , OK .
Well , that &apos;s what juggling is about , right ?
It &apos;s being able to do something that other people can &apos;t do or can &apos;t understand .
All right . So , that &apos;s one way of doing it , which is five balls down .
OK ? Another way is the outside .
And you could play with the rhythm .
Same pattern .
Make it faster and smaller .
Make it wider .
Make it narrower .
Bring it back up .
OK . It &apos;s done . Thanks .
Now , what I wanted to get to is that you &apos;re all very bright , very tactile .
I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are , but let &apos;s try something .
OK , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the five-ball pattern is , I &apos;m going to give you a little clue .
Enough of a clue ? So , you get the pattern , right ? OK .
You &apos;re not getting off that easy . All right ?
Now , do me a favor : follow the ball that I ask you to follow .
Green .
Yellow .
Pink .
White .
OK , you can do that ? Yeah ? OK .
Now , let &apos;s actually learn something .
Actually , let me put you in that area of learning , which is very insecure .
You want to do it ? Yeah ? OK .
Hands out in front of you . Palms up , together .
What you &apos;re going to learn is this .
OK ? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it .
Index finger , middle finger , ring , little .
Little , ring , middle , index . And then open .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
A little bit faster .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
All right . A lot of different learning processes going on in here .
One learning process that I see is this -- OK . Another learning process that I see is this -- OK . So , everybody take a deep breath in , breath out . OK .
Now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . Open .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . OK .
Shake your hands out .
Now , I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer .
OK ? So , what you &apos;re doing is , you &apos;re going la , la , la , and you &apos;re getting this . OK ?
So that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m going to ask you to do , but in a slightly different way . You &apos;re going to combine it .
So what I want you to do is -- fingers .
I &apos;ll tell you what to do with your fingers , same thing .
But I want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow .
OK ? Here we go .
So , we &apos;re going to start off looking at the white ball -- and I &apos;m going to tell you which color , and I &apos;m also going to tell you to go with your fingers . OK ?
So white ball and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . Pink .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . Green .
Finger , finger , finger , finger . Yellow .
Finger , finger , finger , pink or finger .
Pink , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
All right .
How did you do ? Well ? OK . The reason I wanted you to do this is because that &apos;s actually what most people face throughout their lives , a moment of learning , a moment of challenge .
It &apos;s a moment that you can &apos;t make sense of .
Why the hell should I learn this ? OK ?
Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life ?
You know , I can &apos;t decipher -- is it fun ? Is it challenging ? Am I supposed to cheat ?
You know , what are you supposed to do ?
You &apos;ve got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life . OK ?
Trying to figure that stuff out . But is it going to get you anywhere ?
It &apos;s just a moment . That &apos;s all it is , a moment . OK ?
I &apos;m going to change the script for one second . Just let me do this .
I don &apos;t need music for it . Talking about time in a moment .
There &apos;s a piece that I recently developed which was all about that , a moment . And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects .
What I &apos;ve done for you here , I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together , but they &apos;re not original techniques .
Now , I &apos;m going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I &apos;ve developed . OK ?
So , a moment , how would you define a moment ?
Well , as a juggler , what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment .
Ahhh .
All right , I &apos;m going to get on my knees and do it .
So , a moment .
OK ? And then , what I did as a juggler was say , OK , what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else , another dynamic .
So , a moment .
Another moment .
Excuse me , still getting there . A moment that travels .
A moment -- no , we &apos;ll try that again . It separates , and comes back together .
Time . How can you look at time ?
And what do you dedicate it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
Well , obviously , there &apos;s something in here , and you can all have a guess as to what it is .
There &apos;s a mystery . There &apos;s a mystery in the moment .
And it has to settle . And then it &apos;s dependent on something else .
And then it comes to rest . Just a little thing about time .
Now , this has expanded into a much bigger piece , because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I &apos;m keeping time with this .
But I just thought I &apos;d talk about a moment .
All right . OK . Can we show the video of the triangle ?
Are we ready to do that ? Yes ?
This is the piece that I told you about .
It &apos;s a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle .
Thanks . The only thing I &apos;ll say about the last session is , you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour ?
The only other thing is , it was a real shock .
I always drove motorcycles . And when I bought my first car , it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents &apos; house . Interesting .
Anyway , balance : constant movement to find an approach to stillness .
Balance : making up the rules so you can &apos;t cheat , so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body .
To have a conversation with it . To speak . To listen .
Hup . Now , it &apos;s dependent on rhythm , and keeping a center of balance . When it falls , going underneath .
So , there &apos;s a rhythm to it .
The rhythm can get much smaller .
As your skill increases , you learn to find those tinier spaces , those tinier movements . Thanks .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways , and also -- oh , actually , if you &apos;re bored , not here , here &apos;s one use for it .
You can go with the &quot; Sticks One &quot; music .
Thanks . That has a certain kind of balance to it , which is all about plumb .
I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb , square and level .
And they influenced that , and this next piece , which I &apos;ll do a little segment of .
&quot; Two Sticks , &quot; you can go with it . Thanks .
Which is again exploring space , or the lines in space .
Working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
Oh , let &apos;s see here .
So , I &apos;ll come back to that in a second . But working with one ball , now , what if you attach something to it , or change it .
This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together .
And then creating space and the rhythm of space , using the surface of the balls , the surface of the arms .
Just a little toy . Which leads me to the next thing , which is -- what have I got here ? OK . All right .
I &apos;m actually leading up to something , the newest thing that I &apos;m working on . This is not it .
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .
Now , what I just did was I worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference .
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that I look at a shape and say , what about if I use this and this and this .
Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with .
The next piece that I &apos;m going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . I love ceramics and all of that .
It &apos;s a combination of that , the beauty of that , the shape , and the stories that were involved in it , as well as the fact that they protected the contents .
The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness .
So , if you want to go with the music for cylinders .
Talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run &quot; S-Curve music ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to do just a short version of it .
Circles split in half and rotated , and mythology .
Anyway , that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it , and I dance around a small stage so -- two minutes , just to end ? The latest piece that I &apos;m working on -- what I love is that I never know what I &apos;m working on , why I &apos;m working on it .
They &apos;re not ideas , they &apos;re instincts .
And the latest thing that I &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- I don &apos;t know what it is yet .
And that &apos;s good . I like not to know for as long as possible .
Well , because then it tells me the truth , instead of me imposing the truth .
And what it is , is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves .
And what it involves , and I don &apos;t know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not , but I &apos;ll do a little bit of it .
It initially started off with me stacking these things , bunches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . And then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
And then changing levels .
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments , not to just make -- I &apos;ll try one other thing .
For work in three dimensions , with your perceptions of space and time .
Now , I don &apos;t know exactly where it &apos;s going , but I &apos;ve got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
And it &apos;s going to change as I go through it .
But I really like it , it feels right .
This may not be the right shape , and -- look at this shape , and then I &apos;ll show you the first design I ever put to it , just to see , just to play , because I love all different kinds of things to play with .
Let &apos;s see here .
To work with the positive and negative in a different way .
And to change , and to change .
So , I &apos;m off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space .
We &apos;ll see what I come up with . Thanks for having me .
This is poo , and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you , which might be quite difficult , but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo .
So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice , and yet it can do things that you and I couldn &apos;t possibly entertain the idea of doing .
And basically it &apos;s all evolved to handle its food source , which is dung .
So the question is , where do we start this story ?
And it seems appropriate to start at the end , because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals , but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living , and so dung beetles eat dung , and their larvae are also dung-feeders .
They are grown completely in a ball of dung .
Within South Africa , we &apos;ve got about 800 species of dung beetles , in Africa we &apos;ve got 2,000 species of dung beetles , and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles .
So , according to dung beetles , dung is pretty good .
Unless you &apos;re prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself , you &apos;ll never see 90 percent of the dung beetle species , because they go directly into the dung , straight down below it , and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground .
So the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort .
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball , and this ball they roll away from the dung source , usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source , and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls .
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball .
You can see it &apos;s a male because he &apos;s got a little hair on the back of his legs there , and he &apos;s clearly very pleased about what he &apos;s sitting on there .
And then he &apos;s about to become a victim of a vicious smash-and-grab .
And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource .
And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way , and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this , because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung .
So this dung pat was actually -- well , it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken , and we think it &apos;s the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung .
So what you &apos;ve got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld .
Its head is down . It &apos;s walking backwards .
It &apos;s the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction , and at the same time it &apos;s got to deal with the heat .
This is Africa . It &apos;s hot .
So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems .
So watch this beetle , and there &apos;s two things that I would like you to be aware of .
The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we &apos;ve put in its way . See , look , it does a little dance , and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place .
A little dance , and then heads off in a particular direction .
So clearly this animal knows where it &apos;s going and it knows where it wants to go , and that &apos;s a very , very important thing , because if you think about it , you &apos;re at the dung pile , you &apos;ve got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else , and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line .
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with , and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet . And watch its response .
So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet . It &apos;s turned by 90 degrees .
But it doesn &apos;t flinch . It knows exactly where it wants to go , and it heads off in that particular direction .
So our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
What are they doing ? And there was a cue that was available to us .
It was that every now and then they &apos;d climb on top of the ball and they &apos;d take a look at the world around them .
And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball ?
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement ? And the most obvious one is to look at the sky , and so we thought , now what could they be looking at in the sky ?
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
So a classic experiment here , in that what we did was we moved the sun .
What we &apos;re going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
And look at what the beetle does .
It does a little double dance , and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place .
What happens now ? So clearly they &apos;re looking at the sun .
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them .
The thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
What is happening in the sky here is that there &apos;s a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can &apos;t see . It &apos;s the way our eyes are built .
But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon , say it &apos;s over on this side , there is a north-south , a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can &apos;t see that the beetles can see .
So how do we test that ? Well , that &apos;s easy .
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter , pop the beetle underneath it , and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky .
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn , because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in .
So obviously beetles can see polarized light .
Okay , so what we &apos;ve got so far is , what are beetles doing ? They &apos;re rolling balls .
How are they doing it ? Well , they &apos;re rolling them in a straight line .
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line ?
Well , they &apos;re looking at celestial cues in the sky , some of which you and I can &apos;t see .
But how do they pick up those celestial cues ?
That was what was of interest to us next .
And it was this particular little behavior , the dance , that we thought was important , because look , it takes a pause every now and then , and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in .
So what are they doing when they do this dance ?
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
And in this experiment here , what we did was we forced them into a channel , and you can see he wasn &apos;t particularly forced into this particular channel , and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in , in the first place .
And let &apos;s see what his reaction is as he &apos;s headed through 90 degrees here , and now he &apos;s going to -- when he ends up down here , he &apos;s going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction .
And see what his response is .
He does a little dance , he turns around , and heads back in this . He knows exactly where he &apos;s going .
He knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves .
So that &apos;s the dance , but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days , we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior .
Every now and then , when they climb on top of the ball , they wipe their face .
And you see him do it again .
Now we thought , now what could be going on here ?
Clearly the ground is very hot , and when the ground is hot , they dance more often , and when they do this particular dance , they wipe the bottom of their face .
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down .
So what we did was design a couple of arenas .
one was hot , one was cold .
We shaded this one . We left that one hot .
And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera .
So what you &apos;re looking at here is a heat image of the system , and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball .
So the truth is , if you look at the temperature over here , dung is cool .
So all we &apos;re interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background .
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 35 degrees centigrade , so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld .
It isn &apos;t climbing . It isn &apos;t dancing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .
It &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
And what &apos;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment , look at the temperature of the soil .
It &apos;s up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade .
Watch how often the beetle dances .
And look at its front legs . They &apos;re roaringly hot .
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face , and all the time it &apos;s trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it &apos;s walking across .
And what we did then was put little boots on these legs , because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil .
And if you look over here , with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on .
So we described these as cool boots .
It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots .
And we also cooled down the dung ball , so we were able to put the ball in the fridge , gave them a nice cool dung ball , and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball .
So this is called stilting . It &apos;s a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a towel , somebody has this towel -- &quot; Sorry , I &apos;ve jumped onto your towel . &quot; -- and then you scuttle across onto somebody else &apos;s towel , and that way you don &apos;t burn your feet .
And that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
However , there &apos;s one more story I &apos;d like to share with you , and that &apos;s this particular species .
It &apos;s from a genus called Pachysoma .
There are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting .
This is a dung beetle . Watch what he &apos;s doing .
Can you spot the difference ?
They don &apos;t normally go this slowly . It &apos;s in slow motion .
but it &apos;s walking forwards , and it &apos;s actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it .
This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior .
There &apos;s one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle &apos;s behavior that we found quite fascinating , and that &apos;s that it forages and provisions a nest .
So watch this individual here , and what he &apos;s trying to do is set up a nest .
And he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets .
And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path , and compare the two .
And by and large , you &apos;ll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path .
On the outward path , he &apos;s always on the lookout for a new blob of dung .
On the way home , he knows where home is , and he wants to go straight to it .
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip , as in most dung beetles . The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site .
And watch , you &apos;re going to see another South African crime taking place right now .
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets .
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a behavior called path integration .
And what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . It knows exactly where its home is .
Now there &apos;s two ways it could be doing that , and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it &apos;s at the foraging site .
If it &apos;s using landmarks , it will find its home .
If it is using something called path integration , it will not find its home . It will arrive at the wrong spot , and what it &apos;s doing here if it &apos;s using path integration is it &apos;s counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction .
It knows the bearing home , and it knows it should be in that direction .
If you displace it , it ends up in the wrong place .
So let &apos;s see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment .
So here &apos;s our cunning experimenter .
He displaces the beetle , and now we have to see what is going to take place .
What we &apos;ve got is a burrow . That &apos;s where the forage was .
The forage has been displaced to a new position .
If he &apos;s using landmark orientation , he should be able to find the burrow , because he &apos;ll be able to recognize the landmarks around it .
If he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
So let &apos;s watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test .
So there he is there .
He &apos;s about to head home , and look what happens .
Shame .
It hasn &apos;t a clue .
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food , but it is clearly completely lost .
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around , and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it .
So what we &apos;re looking at here are a group of animals to find their way around , and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance , and we know that these species here actually count the steps . That &apos;s what they use as an odometer , a step-counting system , to find their way back home .
We don &apos;t know yet what dung beetles use .
So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that &apos;s the size of a grain of rice ?
Well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it &apos;s also a thermoregulation behavior , and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home .
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn &apos;t possibly do .
Thank you .
In terms of invention , I &apos;d like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects .
I think it &apos;s one of the most exciting that I &apos;m working on , but I think it &apos;s also the simplest .
It &apos;s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet , the number one cause of death in children under five , which is ... ? Water-borne diseases ? Diarrhea ? Malnutrition ?
No , it &apos;s breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this . Can you believe that ?
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling .
Can &apos;t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
Can &apos;t we make better stoves ?
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes , so I &apos;m going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes , which is charcoal .
So this is a picture of rural Haiti . Haiti is now 98 percent deforested .
You &apos;ll see scenes like this all over the island .
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation .
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that &apos;s directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil .
So the rains come , they go down the rivers , and the flooding happens .
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it .
It &apos;s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .
They know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
Fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy doesn &apos;t cook the way that they like their food prepared .
And so this is what they do .
You &apos;ll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree , cut it down and make charcoal out of it .
So not surprisingly , there &apos;s a lot of effort that &apos;s been done to look at alternative cooking fuels .
About four years ago I took a team of students down to Haiti , and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there .
This is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .
And the idea was that you could take waste paper ; you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel .
But this device was very slow .
So our engineering students went to work on it , and with some very simple changes , they were able to triple the throughput of this device .
So you could imagine they were very excited about it .
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them .
And one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t burn .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
And in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says , &quot; U.S. Peace Corps . &quot;
As it turns out , there actually wasn &apos;t any waste paper in this village .
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village , it was 800 kilometers away .
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel .
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level .
You see these all over Haiti as well . They &apos;re small-scale sugar mills .
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called &quot; bagasse . &quot;
It has no other use . It has no nutritional value , so they don &apos;t feed it to the animals .
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it .
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with , something like charcoal .
So over the next couple of years , students and I worked to develop a process .
So you start with the bagasse , and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum .
After some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
However , you can &apos;t burn this . It &apos;s too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
And conveniently , one of my students was from Ghana , and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; kokonte , &quot; which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .
And so what we did was we looked , and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti , under the name of &quot; manioc . &quot;
And in fact , it &apos;s grown all over the world -- yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it &apos;s all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable .
And you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .
So we did this . We went down to Haiti .
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Chabon , or Charcoal Institute . And these -- -- that &apos;s right . So I &apos;m actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT .
And these are the briquettes that we made .
Now I &apos;m going to take you to a different continent . This is India , and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India ; it &apos;s cow dung .
And more than in Haiti , this produces really smoky fires , and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .
Kids and women are especially affected by it , because they &apos;re the ones who are around the cooking fires .
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there .
Well unfortunately , they didn &apos;t have sugarcane and they didn &apos;t have cassava , but that didn &apos;t stop us .
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass .
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .
And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure , which they used ordinarily for their fuel .
And we did side-by-side tests , and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung .
And you can see that it &apos;s a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .
And in fact , it heats the water a lot more quickly .
And so we were very happy , thus far .
But one of the things that we found it didn &apos;t burn as long . And the briquettes crumbled a little bit , and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti .
So we went back to MIT , we took out the Instron machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ?
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this , we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process , to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there .
And after some time , we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
So now we &apos;re in a situation where we have a product , which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace , which is a very wonderful place to be .
In Haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year .
There &apos;s a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those .
In addition , the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars .
That &apos;s an awful lot for a country of Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars .
So this is where we &apos;re also moving ahead with our charcoal project .
And one of the things that I think is also interesting , is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who &apos;s been doing risk analysis .
And he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .
And he &apos;s found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . That &apos;s remarkable , but up until now , there weren &apos;t ways to do it without cutting down trees .
But now we have a way One of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month .
And this is , I think , the coolest thing , and it &apos;s even lower tech than what you just saw , if you can imagine such a thing . Here it is .
So what is this ? This is corncobs turned into charcoal .
And the beauty of this is that you don &apos;t need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made . This is my $ 100 laptop , right here .
And actually , like Nick , I brought samples .
So we can pass these around .
They &apos;re fully functional , field-tested , ready to roll out .
And I think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology , is that the technology transfer is so easy .
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal , where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder , this comes pre-briquetted .
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now , which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .
But once you see it , like you guys in the front row , all right , yeah , OK . So anyway -- -- here it is . And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things .
So not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits .
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
They can generate income from this .
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal , and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren &apos;t making their own .
It &apos;s really rare that you don &apos;t have trade-offs between health and economics , or environment and economics .
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting , and I &apos;m really looking forward to see where it takes us .
So when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
And now I don &apos;t actually mean the world that we live in .
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat .
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand , and where , when you work 10 hours a day , you &apos;re still only earning 60 dollars in a month .
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water .
That &apos;s as if the entire workforce of the State of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water .
It &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were India , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
If this were Afghanistan , only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet .
If this were Zambia , 300 of you would be farmers , 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV .
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers , our designers , our business people , our entrepreneurs to be facing .
These are the solutions that we need to find .
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address .
One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise , so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they &apos;re not doing it using the same traditional basket making , poultry rearing , etc .
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale .
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops .
And we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we &apos;re not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
We need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . That &apos;s the best way to do it .
We shouldn &apos;t be doing it from outside .
So we need to create this future , and we need to start doing it now .
Thank you .
Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you &apos;ve worked on .
Amy Smith : A couple of other things that we &apos;re working on are looking at ways to do low-cost water quality testing , so that communities can maintain their own water systems , know when they &apos;re working , know when they treat them , etc .
We &apos;re also looking at low-cost water treatment systems .
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that .
What &apos;s the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
Do you need to find entrepreneurs , or venture capitalists , or what do you need to take what you &apos;ve got and get it to scale ?
AS : Yeah , I think its large numbers of people moving it forward .
It &apos;s a difficult thing ; it &apos;s a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income .
So you can &apos;t use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward .
And we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
So , you know , I do what I can with the students .
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame , as -- you know , you can &apos;t expect to get something done in a year or two years ; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead .
But I think with the vision to do that , we can move forward .
Good afternoon .
I am not a farmer .
I &apos;m not . I &apos;m a parent , I &apos;m a resident and I &apos;m a teacher .
And this is my world .
And along the way I &apos;ve started noticing -- I &apos;m on my third generation of kids -- that they &apos;re getting bigger .
They &apos;re getting sicker .
In addition to these complexities , I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition .
The realities of my community are simple . They look like this .
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this .
And as jobs continue to leave my community , and energy continues to come in , be exported in , it &apos;s no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert .
But I &apos;m the oldest sixth grader you &apos;ll ever meet , so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I &apos;m hoping to share with you all today .
And with that note , I come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live , learn and earn in a better one .
So I &apos;m here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside , which I &apos;m now bringing inside .
And it starts with three people .
The crazy teacher -- that &apos;s me on the left , I dress up pretty , thank you , my wife , I love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology .
But it all starts with seeds in classrooms , in my place , which looks like this .
And I &apos;m here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp .
And that &apos;s really what this is all about .
And it starts with incredible kids like this , who come early and stay late .
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners , most come with a lot of handicaps , most are homeless and many are in foster care .
Almost all of my kids live below poverty .
But with those seeds , from day one , we are growing in my classroom , and this is what it looks like in my classroom .
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds .
And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this .
But again , I am not a farmer . I &apos;m a teacher .
And I don &apos;t like weeding , and I don &apos;t like back-breaking labor .
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small , like this , and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it , kids who didn &apos;t want to be outside could do it , and everyone could have access .
So I called George Irwin , and what do you know ?
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall .
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences , private-based learning .
And lo and behold , we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City .
So if you &apos;re hungry , get up and eat .
You can do it right now . My kids play cow all the time .
Okay ? But we were just getting started , the kids loved the technology , so we called up George and we said , &quot; We gotta learn more ! &quot;
Now , Mayor Bloomberg , thank you very much , we no longer need work permits , which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we &apos;re available for you -- We decided to go to Boston .
And my kids , from the poorest congressional district in America , became the first to install a green wall , designed by a computer , with real-live learning tools , 21 stories up -- if you &apos;re going to go visit it , it &apos;s on top of the John Hancock building .
But closer to home , we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that , real LED stuff , 21st-century technology .
And what do you know ? We made 21st century money , and that was groundbreaking . Wow !
This is my harvest , people .
And what do you do with this food ? You cook it !
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce , with plastic forks , and we get it into the cafeteria , and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers .
And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President .
And what &apos;d we do then ? Well , I met nice people like you , and they invited us to the Hamptons .
So I call this &quot; from South Bronx to Southampton . &quot;
And we started putting in roofs that look like this , and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this , wow ! People noticed .
And so we got invited back this past summer , and we actually moved into the Hamptons , payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house , and we learned how to surf .
And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology , and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this , this is the new green graffiti .
So , you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids , besides changing landscapes and mindsets ?
Okay , I &apos;m going to tell you what it does .
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this , Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services .
And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line .
Because Jim realized that these kids , my future farmers , really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers , right in their own neighborhood .
And this is what my kids are doing , making living wage .
Now , if you &apos;re like me , you live in a building , there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars .
I don &apos;t have it . But if you need a toilet fixed or , you know , some shelving , I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me .
That &apos;s the beauty of this economy .
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade .
And that &apos;s my first student to open up , the first in his family to have a bank account .
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM .
And this is the true triple bottom line , because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this .
Wow ! People noticed . And notice they did .
So CNN called , and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer &apos;s market .
And then when Rockefeller Center said , NBC , could you put this thing up on the walls ? We were delighted .
But this , I show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of New York City , that &apos;s a true &quot; sí se puede &quot; moment .
Really scholastic , if you ask me .
But this is not a Getty image .
That &apos;s a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President , addressing my kids in his house , not the jailhouse , making them feel a part of it .
That &apos;s our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder , coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important .
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class , believe you me , the Bronx can change attitudes now .
We are poised , ready , willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we &apos;ve never even imagined .
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he &apos;s got to lose weight , so do I !
And I tell you what , I &apos;m doing it and so are the kids .
Okay ? And then celebrities started .
Produce Pete can &apos;t believe what we grow .
Lorna Sass came and donated books .
Okay ? We &apos;re feeding seniors .
And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx , so did the international community .
And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference .
And that &apos;s just great .
Except what about locally ?
Well , we met this woman , Avis Richards , with the Ground Up Campaign .
Unbelievable ! Through her , my kids , the most disenfranchised and marginalized , were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools .
That &apos;s triple bottom line ! Okay ?
A year ago today , I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine .
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense , especially when the resources were free .
So thank you all and I love them .
They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health , again , free resources , don &apos;t waste them .
And what do you know ? Six months later , my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment .
The greenest class in New York City .
But more importantly is my kids learned to get , they learned to give .
And we took the money that we made from our farmer &apos;s market , and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world .
So we started giving back .
And that &apos;s when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pockets , then with the heart and then with the mind .
So we were onto something , and we &apos;re still onto something .
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed , because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine .
We &apos;re 3,000 strong right now .
And what does it really do ?
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities , so when they grow up in places like this , they can imagine it like this .
And my kids , trained and certified -- Ma , you get the tax abatement . Thank you , Mayor Bloomberg -- can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that , and that to me , people , is another true &quot; sí se puede &quot; moment .
Now , how does it start ? It starts in schools .
No more little Knicks and little Nets .
Group by broccoli , group by your favorite vegetable , something you can aspire to .
Okay ? And these are my future farmers of America , growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street , the most migrant community in America .
When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this , it &apos;s no wonder we get fruit like that .
And I love it ! And so do they .
And we &apos;re building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down .
And that &apos;s a true &quot; sí se puede &quot; moment .
And again , Brook Park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint .
The poorest congressional district in America , the most migratory community in America , we can do this .
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions , moving kids into an economy they never imagined .
Now , somewhere over the rainbow , my friends , is the South Bronx of America . And we &apos;re doing it .
How does it start ? Well , look at Jose &apos;s attention to detail .
Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground , and not aisle 9 at the supermarket or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam .
And when Henry knows that green is good , so do I.
And when you expand their palates , you expand their vocabulary .
And most importantly , when you put big kids together with little kids , you get the big fat white guy out of the middle , which is cool , and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers , which is incredible .
God , I &apos;m going to run out of time , so I &apos;ve gotta keep it moving .
But this is my weekly paycheck for kids ; that &apos;s our green graffiti .
This is what we &apos;re doing .
And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County .
Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other .
I gotta tell you , I &apos;m a protective parent .
But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains .
We &apos;re also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent .
We &apos;re also becoming children of the corn , creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage .
Now I don &apos;t expect every kid to be a farmer , but I expect you to read about it , write about it , blog about it , offer outstanding customer service .
I expect them to be engaged , and man , are they !
So that &apos;s my incredible classroom , that &apos;s the food .
Where does it go ? Zero miles to plate , right down into the cafeteria .
Or more importantly , to local shelters , where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day .
And we &apos;re stepping it up .
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm .
And in his day , a million dollar gardens and incredible installations .
Let me tell you something , people .
This is a beautiful moment .
Black field , brown field , toxic waste field , battlefield -- we &apos;re proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
And we take orders for flowers . I &apos;m putting the bake sale to shame .
We take orders now . I &apos;m booking for the spring .
And these were all grown from seeds . We &apos;re learning everything .
And again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
Now , you may ask about these kids .
Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance .
All start overage and under-credit .
They are now , my first cohort is all in college , earning a living wage .
The rest are scheduled to graduate this June .
Happy kids , happy families , happy colleagues .
Amazed people . The glory and bounty that is Bronx County .
Let &apos;s talk about mint . Where is my mint ?
I grow seven kinds of mint in my class .
Mojitos , anybody ? I &apos;ll be at Telepan later .
But , understand this is my intellectual Viagra .
Ladies and gentlemen , I gotta move quick , but understand this : The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to the organic ones .
My green &#91; unclear &#93; 25,000 pounds of vegetables , I &apos;m growing organic citizens , engaged kids .
So help us go from this to this .
Self-sustaining entities , 18 months return on investment , plus we &apos;re paying people living wage and health benefits , while feeding people for pennies on the dollar .
Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity .
So here in New York , I urge you , my fellow Americans , to help us make America great again .
It &apos;s simple . Share your passion .
It &apos;s real easy . Go see these two videos , please .
One got us invited to the White House , one &apos;s a recent incarnation .
And most importantly , get the biggest bully out of schools .
This has got to go tomorrow .
People , you can all do that .
Keep kids out of stores that look like this .
Make them a healthy plate , especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso !
Model good behavior . Get them to a green cart .
Big kids love strawberries and bananas .
Teach them entrepreneurship . Thank God for GrowNYC .
Let them cook . Great lunch today , let them do culinary things .
But most importantly , just love them .
Nothing works like unconditional love .
So , my good friend Kermit said it &apos;s not easy being green .
It &apos;s not . I come from a place where kids can buy 35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment , where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor .
Okay ? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me , we have everything to gain and nothing to lose .
So here , and at a time when we &apos;ve gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity , I urge you to do something .
I urge you to do something .
Right now , we &apos;re all tadpoles , but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big , green leap .
I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re on the left , on the right , up the middle , wherever .
Join me . Use -- I &apos;ve got a lot of energy . Help me use it .
We can do something here .
And along the way , please take time to smell the flowers , especially if you and your students grew them .
I &apos;m Steve Ritz , this is Green Bronx Machine .
I &apos;ve got to say thank you to my wife and family , for my kids , thank you for coming every day , and for my colleagues , believing and supporting me .
We are growing our way into a new economy .
Thank you , God bless you and enjoy the day . I &apos;m Steve Ritz .
Sí se puede !
I work with a species called &quot; Bonobo . &quot;
And I &apos;m happy most of the time , because I think this is the happiest species on the planet .
It &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
This species lives only in the Congo .
And they &apos;re not in too many zoos , because of their sexual behavior .
Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with .
But -- actually , we have a lot to learn from them , because they &apos;re a very egalitarian society and they &apos;re a very empathetic society .
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside .
It permeates their entire life .
And it &apos;s used for communication .
And it &apos;s used for conflict resolution .
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of , divided our lives up into lots of parts .
We divided our world up with lots of categories .
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit .
But I don &apos;t think that we were that way initially .
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there &apos;s something very , very special about man .
Maybe it &apos;s his ability to have causal thought .
Maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to have language .
Maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics .
Well , I don &apos;t know . There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire .
They had no stone tools .
To our knowledge they had no music .
So when you compare them to the Bonobo , the Bonobo is a little hairier .
He doesn &apos;t stand quite as upright .
But there are a lot of similarities .
And I think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
And I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; I think we &apos;ve attributed it to our biology , but I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo .
This is Kanzi .
He &apos;s a Bonobo .
Right now , he &apos;s in a forest in Georgia .
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa .
And she came to us when she was just at puberty , about six or seven years of age .
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right , and a chimpanzee on your left .
Clearly , the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking .
The Bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy .
As you can see , there &apos;s not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked .
As they turn toward us you &apos;ll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn &apos;t have to rotate quite so much from side to side .
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier .
And now we see all four .
The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa , in the jungle encircled by the Congo River .
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo , almost three decades ago .
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee .
Slim-bodied , Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally .
What &apos;s more , they are able to walk upright for long distances .
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh : Let &apos;s go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame .
SS : This is Kanzi and I , in the forest .
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
None of them are tricks .
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously , by NHK of Japan .
We have eight Bonobos .
Look at all this stuff that &apos;s here for our campfire .
SS : An entire family at our research centre .
You going to help get some sticks ?
Good .
We need more sticks , too .
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
That &apos;s a wasps &apos; nest .
You can get it out .
I hope I have a lighter .
You can use the lighter to start the fire .
SS : So Kanzi is very interested in fire .
He doesn &apos;t do it yet without a lighter , but I think if he saw someone do it , he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter .
He &apos;s learning about how to keep a fire going .
He &apos;s learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo .
These are happy vocalizations .
You &apos;re happy .
You &apos;re very happy about this part .
You &apos;ve got to put some water on the fire . You see the water ?
Good job .
SS : Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack .
But he likes to carry things from place to place .
Austin , I hear you saying &quot; Austin . &quot;
SS : He talks to other Bonobos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
This is his sister .
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart .
Goodbye .
SS : She &apos;s got the pedals down , but not the wheel .
She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
Like us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human , and documenting their development across two decades , scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution .
His name is Nyota .
It means &quot; star &quot; in Swahili .
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
In the wild , the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring .
Here Panbanisha uses scissors , instead of her hands , to groom Nyota .
Very impressive .
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself .
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt , Panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
He can now cut through tough animal hide .
SS : Kanzi &apos;s learned to make stone tools .
Kanzi now makes his tools , just as our ancestors may have made them , two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands , to strike one against the other .
He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows , he can make much larger , sharper flakes .
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough .
The tough hide is difficult to cut , even with a knife .
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
Kanzi &apos;s rock is from Gona , Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used ; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi &apos;s .
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods .
She keeps staring out the window .
SS : This is -- let me show you something we didn &apos;t think they would do .
For several days now , Panbanisha has not been outside .
SS : I normally talk about language .
Then Panbanisha does something unexpected .
SS : But since I &apos;m advised not to do what I normally do , I haven &apos;t told you that these apes have language .
It &apos;s a geometric language .
She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor .
What is she writing ?
SS : She &apos;s also saying the name of that , with her voice .
Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again .
SS : These are her symbols on her keyboard .
They speak when she touches them .
Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go .
&quot; A frame &quot; represents a hut in the woods .
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .
SS : Very nice . Beautiful , Panbanisha .
SS : At first we didn &apos;t really realize what she was doing , until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it .
This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram .
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents &quot; collar . &quot;
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out .
SS : That &apos;s an institutional requirement .
This symbol is not as clear as the others , but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines .
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said , by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .
Panbanisha watched .
Soon she began to write as well .
The Bonobo &apos;s abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
How did they develop ?
SS : We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them .
It &apos;s simply to use language around them , because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others , that are important to you , are saying to you .
Once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha .
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica , until Nyota , now one year old , steals it .
Then he peers eagerly into his mother &apos;s mouth .
Is he looking for where the sound came from ?
Dr. Sue thinks it &apos;s important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano .
She wasn &apos;t forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
Researcher : Go ahead . Go ahead . I &apos;m listening .
Do that real fast part that you did . Yeah , that part .
Kanzi plays the xylophone ; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue &apos;s singing .
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
Researcher : OK , now get the monsters . Get them .
Take the cherries too .
Now watch out , stay away from them now .
Now you can chase them again . Time to chase them .
Now you have to stay away . Get away .
Run away . Run .
Now we can chase them again . Go get them .
Oh no !
Good Kanzi . Very good . Thank you so much .
None of us , Bonobo or human , can possibly even imagine ?
SS : So we have a bi-species environment , we call it a &quot; panhomoculture . &quot;
We &apos;re learning how to become like them .
We &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-pitched tones .
We &apos;re learning that they probably have a language in the wild .
And they &apos;re learning to become like us .
Because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
So we &apos;re sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about a technology that we &apos;re developing at Oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made .
That technology is simulating humans .
It &apos;s simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body .
Now , before I talk more about that technology , let &apos;s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games .
This is a clip from a game called &quot; Grand Theft Auto 3 . &quot;
We already saw that briefly yesterday .
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
It &apos;s one of the most successful games of all time .
But what you &apos;ll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive .
They pretty much look the same .
I &apos;ve made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
And you can see he looks always the same .
The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters .
They are a graphical visualization of a character .
To produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
So , he or she sits down , animates it , and tries to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen , and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
Now , the result of that is that you can &apos;t have real interactivity .
All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times .
It also means that games aren &apos;t really going to be as surprising as they could be , because you only get out of it , at least in terms of the character , what you actually put into it .
There &apos;s no real emergence there .
And thirdly , as I said , most of the animations are very repetitive because of that .
Now , the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body .
And maybe , if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because , I mean , it &apos;s very , very trivial .
If I push Chris a bit , like this , for example , he &apos;ll react to it .
If I push him from a different angle , he &apos;ll react to it differently , and that &apos;s because he has a physical body , and because he has the motor skills to control that body .
It &apos;s a very trivial thing .
It &apos;s not something you get in computer games at the moment , at all .
Thank you very much . That &apos;s it ?
Torsten Reil : That &apos;s it , yes .
So , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to simulate -- not Chris specifically , I should say , but humans in general .
Now , we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University , and we tried to start very simply .
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk .
That stick figure is physically stimulated . You can see it here on the screen .
So , it &apos;s subject to gravity , has joints , etc .
If you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work .
And for that , we use the neural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
It &apos;s called the central pattern generator .
So , we simulated that as well , and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms .
We heard about those already yesterday , and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .
But , just briefly , the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks , in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning .
You hook these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
At the beginning , they &apos;re all going to be very boring .
Most of them won &apos;t move at all , but some of them might make a tiny step .
Those are then selected by the algorithm , reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .
And you repeat that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
So that was the idea behind this .
When we started this , I set up the simulation one evening .
It took about three to four hours to run the simulation .
I got up the next morning , went to the computer and looked at the results , and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line , like I &apos;ve just demonstrated , and this is what I got instead .
So , it was back to the drawing board for us .
We did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
So , what you &apos;ll see in a moment is a very simple biped that &apos;s learning how to walk using artificial evolution .
At the beginning , it can &apos;t walk at all , but it will get better and better over time .
So , this is the one that can &apos;t walk at all .
Now , after five generations of applying evolutionary process , the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better .
Generation 10 and it &apos;ll take a few steps more -- still not quite there .
But now , after generation 20 , it actually walks in a straight line without falling over .
That was the real breakthrough for us .
It was , academically , quite a challenging project , and once we had reached that stage , we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it .
Now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds .
What you see here is the character standing there , and there &apos;s an obstacle that we put in its way .
And what you see is , it &apos;s going to fall over the obstacle .
Now , the interesting bit is , if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right , which is what I &apos;m doing now , here , it will fall over it in a completely different way .
And again , if you move the obstacle a tiny bit , it &apos;ll again fall differently .
Now , what you see , by the way , at the top there , are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles .
Okay . That &apos;s the video . Thanks .
Now , this might look kind of trivial , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
Now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , blocky biped .
What we really wanted was a full human body .
So we started the company .
We hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
It &apos;s got to be relatively fast , so you can run it on a normal machine , but it &apos;s got to be accurate enough , so it looks good enough , basically .
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing , and tried to make it as realistic as possible .
What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body .
I should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
Now , what I &apos;m going to do right now , in a moment , is just push this character a tiny bit and we &apos;ll see what happens .
Nothing really interesting , basically .
It falls over , but it falls over like a rag doll , basically .
The reason for that is that there &apos;s no intelligence in it .
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
So , this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet , in this particular one .
But what it will do -- I &apos;m going to push it again .
It will realize autonomously that it &apos;s being pushed .
It &apos;s going to stick out its hands .
It &apos;s going to turn around into the fall , and try and catch the fall .
So that &apos;s what you see here .
Now , it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well .
So here , we &apos;ve got the same character .
I &apos;m going to push it a bit harder now , harder than I just pushed Chris .
But what you &apos;ll see is -- it &apos;s going to receive a push now from the left .
What you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter-balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it &apos;s going to land .
I &apos;ll show you this again .
And then , finally hits the floor .
Now , this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions , again , just as I &apos;ve done .
That &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
At the moment , you only have empty computer graphics in games .
What this is now is a real simulation . That &apos;s what I want to show you now .
So , here &apos;s the same character with the same behavior I &apos;ve just shown you , but now I &apos;m just going to push it from different directions .
First , starting with a push from the right .
This is all slow motion , by the way , so we can see what &apos;s going on .
Now , the angle will have changed a tiny bit , so you can see that the reaction is different .
Again , a push , now this time from the front .
And you see it falls differently .
And now from the left -- and it falls differently .
That was really exciting for us to see that .
That was the first time we &apos;ve seen that .
This is the first time the public sees this as well , because we have been in stealth mode .
I haven &apos;t shown this to anybody yet .
Now , just a fun thing : what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it , but it &apos;s got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface , like ice .
We just did that for a laugh , just to see what happens .
And this is what happens .
It &apos;s nothing we had to do about this .
We just took this character that I just talked about , put it on a slippery surface , and this is what you get out of it .
And that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
Now , when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology , we got a very good response .
And what they said was , the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen .
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous , they &apos;re very expensive , and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do , obviously , because you can &apos;t really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt .
So , they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .
And that &apos;s our first product that we &apos;re going to release in a couple of weeks .
So , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
That &apos;s what people want . That &apos;s what we &apos;re giving them .
You can see , it &apos;s always reacting .
This is not a dead body . This is a body who basically , in this particular case , feels the force and tries to protect its head .
Only , I think it &apos;s quite a big blow again .
You feel kind of sorry for that thing , and we &apos;ve seen it so many times now that we don &apos;t really care any more .
There are much worse videos than this , by the way , which I have taken out , but ...
Now , here &apos;s another one .
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion , a strong force applied to the character , and have the character react to it in midair .
So that you don &apos;t have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well .
So this character is going to be hit by a force , it &apos;s going to realize it &apos;s in the air , and it &apos;s going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it &apos;s landing .
That &apos;s one angle ; here &apos;s another angle .
We now think that the realism we &apos;re achieving with this is good enough to be used in films .
And let &apos;s just have a look at a slightly different visualization .
This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London , who are using our software and experimenting with it right now .
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw , but in a slightly better rendered version .
So if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
Animators had to actually animate them .
This is all happening automatically in the simulation .
This is a slightly different angle , and again a slow motion version of this .
This is incredibly quick . This is happening in real time .
You can run this simulation in real time , in front of your eyes , change it , if you want to , and you get the animation straight out of it .
At the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
This is another behavior they requested .
I &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
It &apos;s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
In this case , the character &apos;s hands are fixed to a particular point in space , and all we &apos;ve told the character to do is to struggle .
And it looks organic . It looks realistic .
You feel kind of sorry for the guy .
It &apos;s even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .
Now , I &apos;m showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel , how realistic it can look .
And this is all a physical simulation of the body , using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body .
Now , one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene , and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee .
Got a very short clip here .
Yes , you can just about see it here .
In this case , they were using a real stunt man . It was a very dangerous stunt .
It was just voted , I think in the Sunday Times , as one of the most impressive stunts .
Now , we &apos;ve just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves , &quot; Can we do that ourselves as well ? &quot;
Can we use the physical simulation of the character , use artificial intelligence , put that artificial intelligence into the character , drive virtual muscles , simulate the way he jumps off the dam , and then skydive afterwards , and have him caught by a bungee afterwards ?
We did that . It took about altogether just two hours , pretty much , to create the simulation .
And that &apos;s what it looks like , here .
Now , this could do with a bit more work . It &apos;s still very early stages , and we pretty much just did this for a laugh , just to see what we &apos;d get out of it .
But what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we &apos;re pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful .
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations .
There &apos;s very often very surprising behavior that you didn &apos;t predict before .
There &apos;s so many things we can do with this right now .
The first thing , as I said , is going to be virtual stuntmen .
Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen , and they &apos;re going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major productions .
The second thing is video games .
With this technology , video games will look different and they will feel very different .
For the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
I think that &apos;s going to be incredibly exciting .
Probably starting with sports games , which are going to become much more interactive .
But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that Tom Melcher has shown us .
The degree of interactivity you &apos;re going to get is totally different , I think , from what you &apos;re getting right now .
A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation .
We &apos;ve been approached by several simulation companies , but one project we &apos;re particularly excited about , which we &apos;re starting next month , is to use our technology -- and in particular , the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy , to predict the outcome of operations on these children .
As you probably know , it &apos;s very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait .
The classic quote is , I think , it &apos;s unpredictable at best , is what people think right now , is the outcome .
Now , what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool .
We &apos;re going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait , before he actually commits to an actual surgery .
That &apos;s one project we &apos;re particularly excited about , and that &apos;s going to start next month .
Just finally , this is only just the beginning .
We can only do several behaviors right now .
The AI isn &apos;t good enough to simulate a full human body .
The body yes , but not all the motor skills that we have .
And , I think , we &apos;re only there if we can have something like ballet dancing .
Right now , we don &apos;t have that but I &apos;m very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .
We do have one unintentional dancer actually , the last thing I &apos;m going to show you .
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved , I should say -- to produce balance , basically .
So , you kick the guy and the guy &apos;s supposed to counter-balance .
That &apos;s what we thought was going to come out of this .
But this is what emerged out of it , in the end .
Bizarrely , this thing doesn &apos;t have a head . I &apos;m not quite sure why .
So , this was not something we actually put in there .
He just started to create that dance himself .
He &apos;s actually a better dancer than I am , I have to say .
And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end .
And I think -- there you go .
So , that all happened automatically . We didn &apos;t put that in there .
That &apos;s just the simulation creating this itself , basically .
So it &apos;s just -- Thanks .
Not quite John Travolta yet , but we &apos;re working on that as well , so thanks very much for your time .
Thanks .
Incredible . That was really incredible .
Thanks .
Humanity takes center stage at TED , but I would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
Some years ago , it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver .
His name is Jimmy Smith , and he shared a story with me that is told among his people , who call themselves the Kwikwasut &apos;inuxw .
Once upon a time , he told me , all animals on Earth were one .
Even though they look different on the outside , inside , they &apos;re all the same , and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity .
When they arrived , they would all take off their skins .
Raven shed his feathers , bear his fur , and salmon her scales , and then , they would dance .
But one day , a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand .
Embarrassed , the animals fled , and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way .
The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities , all animals are one , has been a powerful inspiration to me .
I like to get past the fur , the feathers and the scales .
I want to get under the skin .
No matter whether I &apos;m facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog , my goal is to connect us with them , eye to eye .
You may wonder , do I ever photograph people ?
Sure . People are always present in my photos , no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions .
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise .
I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing .
When I use my camera , I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are .
As animals blessed with the power of rational thought , we can marvel at the intricacies of life .
As citizens of a planet in trouble , it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life .
But as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
Let &apos;s find a way to join the dance .
Thank you .
My dream is to build the world &apos;s first underground park in New York City .
Now , why would someone want to build an underground park , and why in New York City ?
These three tough little buggers are , on the left , my grandmother , age five , and then her sister and brother , ages 11 and nine .
This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States , just about a century ago .
And like many immigrants at the time , they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot .
What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new , unfamiliar area , but they were also literally building the city .
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by those decades and by that history , and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York .
But she would often just shrug it off , tell me to eat more meatballs , more pasta , and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about .
The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up .
I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference , and to somehow make the world more beautiful , more interesting and more just .
I just didn &apos;t really know how .
At first , I thought I wanted to go work abroad , so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya .
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown .
I took a job with the City of New York , but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy .
I even took a job at Google , where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems .
But I still didn &apos;t feel like I was making the world a better place .
It was in 2009 that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site , This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in 1948 .
Fascinated by this discovery , we begged the authorities to draw us into the space , and we finally got a tour , and this is what we saw .
Now , this photo doesn &apos;t really do it justice . It &apos;s kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
It &apos;s a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city , and it almost feels like you &apos;re Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig , and all the details are all still there .
It &apos;s really pretty remarkable .
Now , the site itself is located at the very heart and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city .
New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities , and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space .
So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public , but also could potentially even be green .
Our plan , in a nutshell , is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street , directs it below the city sidewalks , and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that &apos;s directed underneath .
With this approach , you could take a site and transform it into something that looks like this .
In 2011 , we first released some of these images , a lot of people said to us , &quot; Oh , it kind of looks like the High Line underground . &quot;
And so what our nickname ended up becoming , and what ended up sticking , was the Lowline , so the Lowline was born .
What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
So , like a crazy person , I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project .
Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse .
Here &apos;s the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology .
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there .
And here &apos;s the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse .
You can see the solar canopy overhead , the light streaming in , tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit , and since that time , we &apos;ve grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world .
Here &apos;s a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line &apos;s site , and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next 10 years .
Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there &apos;s really a lack of green space .
So what we &apos;re proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
And right now , we &apos;re focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way .
Here &apos;s our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself .
So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city , and invite people into this warm underground space .
In the middle of winter , when it &apos;s absolutely freezing outside , the last place you &apos;d want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park .
The Lowline would really be a four-season space and a respite for the city .
So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family &apos;s story full circle .
If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out , I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have , rediscovering our shared history , and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting , more beautiful and more just .
Thanks .
These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
We are all familiar with these mundane , The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army .
The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
As much as genocide is about killing .
It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust .
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
Once all the missing persons are identified , only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain .
In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
Thank you very much .
Take a look at this drawing .
Can you tell what it is ?
I &apos;m a molecular biologist by training , and I &apos;ve seen a lot of these kinds of drawings .
They &apos;re usually referred to as a model figure , a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs .
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis .
It &apos;s a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell .
There &apos;s a problem with this drawing , though , and it &apos;s mainly in what it doesn &apos;t show .
From lots of experiments , from lots of different scientists , we know a lot about what these molecules look like , how they move around in the cell , and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment .
So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen , we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that .
So we start outside of the cell .
Now we &apos;re looking inside .
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes .
Through connections with a membrane , clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble , or a vesicle , that &apos;s now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell .
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle , making it separate from the rest of the membrane , and now clathrin is basically done with its job , and so proteins are coming in now — we &apos;ve covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage .
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again .
These processes are too small to be seen directly , even with the best microscopes , so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis .
Here &apos;s another illustration , and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells .
And again , this is a vast oversimplification and doesn &apos;t begin to show what we actually know about these processes .
You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses .
Why ?
Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software , and I spend months on each animation , and that &apos;s just time that most researchers can &apos;t afford .
The payoffs can be huge , though .
Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy .
And I &apos;m working on a new project now called &quot; The Science of HIV &quot; where I &apos;ll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail .
The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades , data on what this virus looks like , how it &apos;s able to infect cells in our body , and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection .
Over the years , I found that animations aren &apos;t just useful for communicating an idea , but they &apos;re also really useful for exploring a hypothesis .
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study , and with the data we have now , that &apos;s just not good enough anymore .
The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas .
One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together , and in this way , animation can feed back into the research process .
I believe that animation can change biology .
It can change the way that we communicate with one another , how we explore our data and how we teach our students .
But for that change to happen , we need more researchers creating animations , and toward that end , I brought together a team of biologists , animators and programmers to create a new , free , open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that &apos;s created just for biologists just to create molecular animations .
From our testing , we &apos;ve found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis .
We &apos;re also building an online database where anyone can view , download and contribute their own animations .
We &apos;re really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today .
We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they &apos;re able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures .
Thank you .
The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery , I had no idea what to expect .
I was a college student in engineering .
I thought it was going to be like on TV .
Ominous music playing in the background , beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon &apos;s face .
But it wasn &apos;t like that at all .
There was music playing on this day , I think it was Madonna &apos;s greatest hits . And there was plenty of conversation , not just about the patient &apos;s heart rate , but about sports and weekend plans .
And since then , the more surgeries I watched , the more I realized this is how it is .
In some weird way , it &apos;s just another day at the office .
But every so often the music gets turned down , everyone stops talking , and stares at exactly the same thing .
And that &apos;s when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening .
The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar , laparoscopic surgery , instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery , a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient .
And then inserts these long , thin instruments and a camera , and actually does the procedure inside the patient .
This is great because there &apos;s much less risk of infection , much less pain , shorter recovery time .
But there is a trade-off , because these incisions are created with a long , pointed device called a trocar .
And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through .
And now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below .
But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because I &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;ve seen it somewhere else .
Remember this ?
You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through , and you didn &apos;t know if it was going to go out the other side and straight into your hand , or if you were going to get juice everywhere , but you were terrified . Right ?
Every single time you did this , you experienced the same fundamental physics that I was watching in the operating room that day .
And it turns out it really is a problem .
In 2003 , the FDA actually came out and said that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery .
Again in 2009 , we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery .
And , oh by the way , this hasn &apos;t changed for 25 years .
So when I got to graduate school , this is what I wanted to work on .
I was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly I was spending my time doing , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s like when you &apos;re drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment .
There &apos;s that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there &apos;s this plunge . Right ?
And he looked at me and he said , &quot; You mean like when they drill into people &apos;s brains ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Excuse me ? &quot; And then I looked it up and they do drill into people &apos;s brains .
actually start with a drill incision through the skull .
And if the surgeon isn &apos;t careful , he can plunge directly into the brain .
So this is the moment when I started thinking , okay , cranial drilling , laparoscopic surgery , why not other areas of medicine ?
Because think about it , when was the last time you went to the doctor So the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere .
And here are just a couple of the procedures that I &apos;ve found that involve some tissue puncture step .
And if we take just three of them — laparoscopic surgery , epidurals , and cranial drilling — every year in this country alone . I call that a problem worth solving .
So let &apos;s take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures .
I mentioned epidurals . This is an epidural needle .
It &apos;s used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth .
Here &apos;s a set of bone marrow biopsy tools .
These are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions .
Here &apos;s a bayonette from the Civil War .
If I had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me .
Because what &apos;s the difference ?
So , the more I did this research the more I thought there has to be a better way to do this .
And for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics .
So what are those physics ?
Let &apos;s go back to drilling through a wall .
So you &apos;re applying a force on a drill towards the wall .
And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back , So , as you drill through the wall , those forces balance . But then there &apos;s that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall , and right at that moment the wall can &apos;t push back anymore .
But your brain hasn &apos;t reacted to that change in force .
So for that millisecond , or however long it takes you to react , you &apos;re still pushing , and that unbalanced force causes an acceleration , and that is the plunge .
But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back , actually oppose the forward acceleration ?
That &apos;s what I set out to do .
So imagine you have a device and it &apos;s got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue .
What &apos;s the simplest way you could pull that tip back ?
I chose a spring .
So when you extend that spring , you extend that tip out so it &apos;s ready to puncture tissue , the spring wants to pull the tip back .
How do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture ?
I used this mechanism .
When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue , the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall .
And the friction that &apos;s generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip .
But right at the moment of puncture , the tissue can &apos;t push back on the tip anymore .
So the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip .
Let me show you that happening in slow motion .
This is about 2,000 frames a second , and I &apos;d like you to notice the tip that &apos;s right there on the bottom , about to puncture through tissue .
And you &apos;ll see that right at the moment of puncture , right there , the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back .
I want to show it to you again , a little closer up .
You &apos;re going to see the sharp bladed tip , and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it &apos;s going to disappear into this white blunt sheath .
Right there .
That happens within four 100ths of a second after puncture .
And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery , or another procedure , it &apos;s applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales .
But it didn &apos;t always look like this .
This was my first prototype .
Yes , those are popsicle sticks , and there &apos;s a rubber band at the top .
It took about 30 minutes to do this , but it worked .
And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project .
I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me .
It kept me up at night .
But I think it should fascinate you too , because I said puncture is everywhere .
That means at some point it &apos;s going to be your problem too .
That first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar .
But last year , I got appendicitis when I was visiting Greece .
So I was in the hospital in Athens , and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery .
He was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions , and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery , and what was going to happen .
He said , &quot; Do you have any questions ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Just one , doc .
What kind of trocar do you use ? &quot;
So my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus : &quot; It is puncture itself that causes risk . &quot;
That &apos;s my favorite quote because H.C. Jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform laparoscopic surgery on humans , and he wrote that in 1912 .
This is a problem that &apos;s been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years .
So it &apos;s easy to think that for every major problem out there there &apos;s some team of experts working around the clock to solve it .
The truth is that &apos;s not always the case .
We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them .
So if you come across a problem that grabs you , let it keep you up at night .
Allow yourself to be fascinated , because there are so many lives to save .
Five years ago , I was a Ph.D. student living two lives .
In one , I used NASA supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft , and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies .
As a data scientist , I did a lot of analyses , mostly of facilities , industrial facilities around the world .
And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together .
And one day , I was thinking about how all data has a location , and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face .
Although I was a satellite engineer , I hadn &apos;t thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
Now , like most of us , I &apos;d been online , I &apos;d see my house , so I thought , I &apos;ll hop in there and I &apos;ll start looking up some of these facilities .
And what I found really surprised me .
The pictures that I was finding were years out of date , and because of that , it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today .
But I was intrigued .
I mean , satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff .
There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today , but there &apos;s still so much we don &apos;t know on a daily basis .
How much oil is stored in all of China ?
How much corn is being produced ?
How many ships are in all of our world &apos;s ports ?
Now , in theory , all of these questions could be answered by imagery , but not if it &apos;s old .
And if this data was so valuable , then how come I couldn &apos;t get my hands on more recent pictures ?
So the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites .
And today , there &apos;s a handful of the great , great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes .
During this period , launching things into space , just the rocket to get the satellite up there , has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each , and that &apos;s created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do , you cram as much functionality in there as possible .
All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive , now nearly a billion , with a b , dollars per copy .
Because they are so expensive , there aren &apos;t very many of them .
Because there aren &apos;t very many of them , the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old .
I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally , but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected , some friends and I put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010 .
As you can see in blue , huge areas of our world are barely seen , less than once a year , and even the areas that are seen most frequently , those in red , are seen at best once a quarter .
Now as aerospace engineering grad students , this chart cried out to us as a challenge .
Why do these things have to be so expensive ?
Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets ?
Wasn &apos;t there a way to build a smaller , simpler , new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging ?
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites , but fortunately we had help .
In the late 1990s , a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space .
This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites .
This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of 100 , and suddenly we could afford to experiment , to take a little bit of risk , and to realize a lot of innovation .
And a new generation of engineers and scientists , mostly out of universities , began launching these very small , breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats .
And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin .
Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches And I can &apos;t remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things , but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset , of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy , of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found , it just seemed boring to go work on anything else .
And so we moved into a cramped , windowless office in Palo Alto , and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab .
The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing .
In space , size drives cost , and we had worked with these very small , breadbox-sized satellites in school , but as we began to better understand the laws of physics , we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited , because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope , and these satellites had a very small , very constrained volume .
And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this .
Although this was the low-cost option , quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable .
So about three or four weeks later , we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed , and they told us that back in the 1970s , the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution , being able to see objects one meter in size , they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images , but get a lot of them at an affordable price .
From our own computer simulations , we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy , for the first time , being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis , while conveniently still not being able to see individuals .
We had found our compromise .
We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox , now more like a mini-fridge , but we still wouldn &apos;t have to build a pickup truck .
So now we had our constraint .
The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build .
What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible , basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb .
The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .
Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner , similar to a Xerox machine , and as they traverse the Earth , they take pictures , scanning row by row by row to build the complete image .
Now people use these because they get a lot of light , which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image .
The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing .
You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target from over 600 miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second , which requires an awesome degree of complexity .
So instead , we turned to a new generation of video sensors , originally created for use in night vision goggles .
Instead of taking a single , high quality image , we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames , all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground , at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system .
And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well , and day by day , our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units .
A few short weeks ago , we packed up SkySat 1 , put our signatures on it , and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth .
Today , it &apos;s sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks .
And soon , we &apos;ll turn our attention to launching a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect .
So why do all of this ? Why build these satellites ?
Well , it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency , and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come .
We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier , and beyond economic data , unlocking the human story , moment by moment .
For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid , it just doesn &apos;t get much better than that .
Thank you .
I have a question : Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die ?
I do . I was a young boy , and my grandfather had just died , and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened .
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him .
But then the really shocking question occurred to me : If he could die , could it happen to me too ?
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept ?
Well , at some point , all children become aware of death .
It can happen in different ways , of course , and usually comes in stages .
Our idea of death develops as we grow older .
And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory , you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too , that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting .
And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species .
Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal , so at some point in the evolution of our species , some early human &apos;s sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize , &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot;
This is , if you like , our curse .
It &apos;s the price we pay for being so damn clever .
We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will , the end of all our projects , our hopes , our dreams , of our individual world .
We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse .
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
And so we look for a way out .
And in my case , as I was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
Now when I first started asking what happens when we die , the grown-ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half-hearted Christianity , and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if I should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then I too would go up there , which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator .
Now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
I used to watch a children &apos;s news program at the time , and this was the era of space exploration .
There were always rockets going up into the sky , up into space , going up there .
But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people .
But I was scared , and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept .
And so I believed it anyway , even though it didn &apos;t make much sense .
And this thought process that I went through as a child , and have been through many times since , including as a grown-up , is a product of what psychologists call a bias .
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong , ways in which we miscalculate , misjudge , distort reality , or see what we want to see , and the bias I &apos;m talking about works like this : Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn &apos;t true and they can , instead , live forever , even if it means taking the existential elevator .
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all .
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies .
Now these studies are ingenious , but they &apos;re simple .
They work like this .
You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects , and you remind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you compare their behavior .
So you &apos;re observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality .
And every time , you get the same result : People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever .
So here &apos;s an example : One recent study took two groups of agnostics , that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs .
Now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
The other group was asked to think about being lonely .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
But put the fear of death in them , and they run to Jesus .
Now , this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe , regardless of the evidence , and it works not just for religion , but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form , whether it &apos;s becoming famous or having children or even nationalism , which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole .
This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history .
Now , the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory , and the idea is simple . It &apos;s just this .
We develop our worldviews , that is , the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it , in order to help us manage the terror of death .
And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations , but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take .
And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history , just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day .
Now I &apos;m going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story , and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they &apos;re retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day .
Now , the first story is the simplest .
We want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going Ancient Egypt had such myths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
Throughout European history , we find them in the work of the alchemists , and of course we still believe this today , only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science .
So 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir , a story that is as old as civilization .
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy .
When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they &apos;re all dead .
So we need a backup plan , and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers , and that &apos;s resurrection .
And it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism .
It accepts that I &apos;m going to have to die but says , despite that , I can rise up and I can live again .
In other words , I can do what Jesus did .
Jesus died , he was three days in the &#91; tomb &#93; , and then he rose up and lived again .
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe , not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims .
But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age , for example , with the idea of cryonics .
That &apos;s the idea that when you die , you can have yourself frozen , and then , at some point when technology has advanced enough , you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected .
And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again , and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it .
But for others , the whole idea of resurrection , of climbing out of the grave , it &apos;s just too much like a bad zombie movie .
They find the body too messy , too unreliable to guarantee eternal life , and so they set their hopes on the third , more spiritual immortality story , the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul .
Now , the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul , and the idea is central to many religions .
But even though , in its current form , in its traditional form , the idea of the soul is still hugely popular , reinventing it for the digital age , for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind , your essence , the real you , onto a computer , and so live on as an avatar in the ether .
But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science , particularly neuroscience , your essence , the real you , is very much dependent on a particular part of your body , that is , your brain .
And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great Greek warrior Achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame .
And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was , and in our digital age , it &apos;s even easier to achieve .
You don &apos;t need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero .
All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat . But some people prefer to leave a more tangible , biological legacy -- children , for example .
Or they like , they hope , to live on as part of some greater whole , a nation or a family or a tribe , their gene pool .
But again , there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality .
Woody Allen , for example , who said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen .
I want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories , and I &apos;ve tried to give just some sense of how they &apos;re retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day .
And the fact that they recur in this way , in such a similar form but in such different belief systems , suggests , I think , that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories .
The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence .
Rather , we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them , and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death .
So the question is , are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial , or can we overcome this bias ?
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could .
He argued that the fear of death is natural , but it is not rational .
&quot; Death , &quot; he said , &quot; is nothing to us , because when we are here , death is not , and when death is here , we are gone . &quot;
Now this is often quoted , but it &apos;s difficult to really grasp , to really internalize , because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine .
So 2,000 years later , another philosopher , Ludwig Wittgenstein , put it like this : &quot; Death is not an event in life : We do not live to experience death .
And so , &quot; he added , &quot; in this sense , life has no end . &quot;
So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void , but it wasn &apos;t rational , because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience .
Now , overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us , yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational , and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us , then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives .
Now , I find it helps to see life as being like a book : Just as a book is bounded by its covers , by beginning and end , so our lives are bounded by birth and death , and even though a book is limited by beginning and end , it can encompass distant landscapes , exotic figures , fantastic adventures .
And even though a book is limited by beginning and end , the characters within it know no horizons .
They only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed .
And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page .
Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of &quot; Treasure Island . &quot;
And so it should be with us .
Imagine the book of your life , its covers , its beginning and end , and your birth and your death .
You can only know the moments in between , the moments that make up your life .
It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
And you needn &apos;t worry how long the book is , or whether it &apos;s a comic strip or an epic .
The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story .
Thank you .
What is so special about the human brain ?
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us ?
What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago , scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of .
Though it was based on very little evidence , many scientists thought that all mammalian brains , including the human brain , were made in the same way , with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain .
This means that two brains of the same size , like these two , with a respectable 400 grams , should have similar numbers of neurons .
Now , if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain , then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities .
And yet , one is a chimp , and the other is a cow .
Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it , but we eat them .
I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex , elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are .
So this is a first indication that the &quot; all brains are made the same way &quot; scenario is not quite right .
But let &apos;s play along .
If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes , larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains , and the larger the brain , the more cognitively able its owner should be .
So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
And here comes the bad news : Our brain , not the largest one around .
It seems quite vexing .
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos , but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos , and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos , which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities .
It must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
Theirs may be bigger , but ours is better , and it could be better , for example , in that it seems larger than it should be , with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies .
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body .
That &apos;s because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes .
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are , so their brains should also be larger than ours , but instead it &apos;s the other way around .
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain .
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses .
Although it weighs only two percent of the body , it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day .
That &apos;s 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories , just to keep your brain working .
So the human brain is larger than it should be , it uses much more energy than it should , so it &apos;s special .
And this is where the story started to bother me .
In biology , we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general , so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us ?
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way .
Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons .
Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain .
Maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cerebral cortex .
So this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
Now , you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons , so 10 years ago , I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from .
But nobody did .
I &apos;ve been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and I could never find it .
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain , and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup .
It works like this : You take a brain , or parts of that brain , and you dissolve it in detergent , which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact , so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this , like a clear soup .
This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain .
Now , the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup , you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid , so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution , you can count nuclei , and therefore tell how many cells that brain had .
It &apos;s simple , it &apos;s straightforward , and it &apos;s really fast .
So we &apos;ve used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far , and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way .
Take rodents and primates , for instance : In larger rodent brains , the average size of the neuron increases , so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons .
But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger , which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain .
The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size , and the larger the brain , the larger this difference will be .
Well , what about our brain then ?
We found that we have , on average , 86 billion neurons , 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex , and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning , and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has , I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean .
Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically , we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain .
So , a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos .
That &apos;s not possible .
A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight , and this impossible brain would go in the body of 89 tons .
I don &apos;t think it looks like us .
So this brings us to a very important conclusion already , which is that we are not rodents .
The human brain is not a large rat brain .
Compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &apos;s not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not rodents .
We are primates , so the correct comparison is to other primates .
And there , if you do the math , you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos , which seems just right , in a body of some 66 kilos , which in my case is exactly right , which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion : I am a primate .
And all of you are primates .
And so was Darwin .
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this .
His brain , like ours , was made in the image of other primate brains .
So the human brain may be remarkable , yes , but it is not special in its number of neurons .
It is just a large primate brain .
I think that &apos;s a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature .
Why does it cost so much energy , then ?
Well , other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs , and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of , we could do the math .
And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple , linear function of its number of neurons , and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect .
So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons , and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal , the relative cost of our brain is large , but just because we &apos;re primates , not because we &apos;re special .
Last question , then : how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons , and in particular , if great apes are larger than we are , why don &apos;t they have a larger brain than we do , with more neurons ?
When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain , I figured , maybe there &apos;s a simple reason .
They just can &apos;t afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons .
So we did the math .
We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods , and on the other hand , how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs , and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive , there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons .
So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons , but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos .
To weigh any more than that , it has to give up neurons .
So it &apos;s either a large body or a large number of neurons .
When you eat like a primate , you can &apos;t afford both .
One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating , but that gets dangerous , and past a certain point , it &apos;s just not possible .
Gorillas and orangutans , for instance , afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating , and that seems to be about as much as they can do .
Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
What about us ?
With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass , we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding , which is just not feasible .
If we ate like a primate , we should not be here .
How did we get here , then ?
Well , if our brain costs just as much energy as it should , and if we can &apos;t spend every waking hour of the day feeding , then the only alternative , really , is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods .
And remarkably , that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago , when they invented cooking .
To cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body .
Cooked foods are softer , so they &apos;re easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth , so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut , which makes them yield much more energy in much less time .
So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food , looking for food , and gobbling down food all day long .
So because of cooking , what once was a major liability , this large , dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons , could now become a major asset , now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them .
So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution , all of the while remaining just a primate brain .
With this large brain now affordable by cooking , we went rapidly from raw foods to culture , agriculture , civilization , grocery stores , electricity , refrigerators , all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint .
So what once was a solution now became the problem , and ironically , we look for the solution in raw food .
So what is the human advantage ?
What is it that we have that no other animal has ?
My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and I think that &apos;s the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
And what is it that we do that no other animal does , and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large , largest number of neurons in the cortex ?
In two words , we cook .
No other animal cooks its food . Only humans do .
And I think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food .
I now look at my kitchen , and I bow to it , and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
Thank you very much .
I made a film that was impossible to make , but I didn &apos;t know it was impossible , and that &apos;s how I was able to do it .
&quot; Mars et Avril &quot; is a science fiction film .
It &apos;s set in Montreal some 50 years in the future .
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it &apos;s expensive , it &apos;s set in the future , and it &apos;s got tons of visual effects , and it &apos;s shot on green screen .
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid , really , back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be .
When American producers see my film , they think that I had a big budget to do it , like 23 million .
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget .
I did &quot; Mars et Avril &quot; for only 2.3 million .
So you might wonder , what &apos;s the deal here ?
How did I do this ?
Well , it &apos;s two things . First , it &apos;s time .
When you don &apos;t have money , you must take time , and it took me seven years to do &quot; Mars et Avril . &quot;
The second aspect is love .
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
And it seems like every department had nothing , so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity .
And that brings me to the point of my talk , actually , how constraints , big creative constraints , can boost creativity .
But let me go back in time a bit .
In my early 20s , I did some graphic novels , but they weren &apos;t your usual graphic novels .
They were books telling a science fiction story through images and text , and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation , they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental , theatrical , simplistic way .
And one of these actors is the great stage director and actor Robert Lepage .
And I just love this guy .
I &apos;ve been in love with this guy since I was a kid .
His career I admire a lot .
And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project , and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eugène Spaak , who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time , space , love , music and women .
And he was a perfect fit for the part , and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance .
He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film , and to write , direct , and produce the film myself .
And Robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity .
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet .
I mean , his agenda is booked until 2042 , and he &apos;s really hard to get , and I wanted him to be in the movie , to reprise his role in the movie .
But the thing is , had I waited for him until 2042 , my film wouldn &apos;t be a futuristic film anymore , so I just couldn &apos;t do that . Right ?
But that &apos;s kind of a big problem .
How do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie ?
Well , I said as a joke in a production meeting -- and this is a true story , by the way — I said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we turn this guy into a hologram ?
Because , you know , he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time , and he &apos;s an illuminated being in my mind , and he &apos;s in between reality and virtual reality , so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram . &quot;
Everybody around the table laughed , but the joke was kind of a good solution , so that &apos;s what we ended up doing .
Here &apos;s how we did it . We shot Robert with six cameras .
He was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium .
Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head , so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed , and we shot only his head .
Six months later there was a guy on set , a mime portraying the body , the vehicle for the head .
And he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with Robert Lepage &apos;s head .
So he became like a renaissance man , and here &apos;s what it looks like in the movie .
Robert Lepage : &#91; As usual , Arthur &apos;s drawing didn &apos;t account for the technical challenges .
I welded the breech , but the valve is still gaping .
I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box , but I might have hit a heartstring .
It still sounds too low . &#93; Jacques Languirand : &#91; That &apos;s normal .
The instrument always ends up resembling its model . &#93; Martin Villeneuve : Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt , they &apos;re my second example of how constraints can boost creativity , because I desperately needed these objects in my movie .
They are objects of desire . They are imaginary musical instruments .
And they carry a nice story with them .
Actually , I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many , many years .
But my problem was , I didn &apos;t have the money to pay for them . I couldn &apos;t afford them .
So that &apos;s kind of a big problem too .
How do you get something that you can &apos;t afford ?
And , you know , I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea .
I said , &quot; What if I have somebody else pay for them ? &quot;
But who on Earth would be interested by seven not-yet-built musical instruments inspired by women &apos;s bodies ?
And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal , because who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen ?
So I found my way to Guy Laliberté , Cirque du Soleil &apos;s CEO , and I presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references , and something pretty amazing happened .
Guy was interested by this idea not because I was asking for his money , but because I came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy .
It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price , because they weren &apos;t even made .
He took a leap of faith .
And the artist , Dominique Engel , brilliant guy , he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year .
And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments in my film for free , which was kind of what I tried to do .
So here they are .
And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green , because this is a weird color , a crazy color , and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later .
And I had , again , pretty much , ideas in my mind as to what the world would be , but then again I turned to my childhood imagination and went to the work of Belgian comic book master François Schuiten in Belgium .
And this guy is another guy I admire a lot , and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer .
But people told me , you know , Martin , it &apos;s impossible , the guy is too busy and he will say no .
Well , I said , you know what , instead of mimicking his style , I might as well call the real guy and ask him , and I sent him my books , and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium .
In other words , there was space for him to dream with me .
So here I was with one of my childhood heroes , drawing every single frame that &apos;s in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future .
And it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom I admire .
But then , you know , eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality .
So , again , my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of .
And there &apos;s this guy in Montreal , another Quebecois called Carlos Monzon , and he &apos;s a very good VFX artist .
This guy had been lead compositor on such films as &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Star Trek &quot; and &quot; Transformers , &quot; and other unknown projects like this , and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job , and I had to convince him , and , instead of working on the next Spielberg movie , he accepted to work on mine .
Why ? Because I offered him a space to dream .
So if you don &apos;t have money to offer to people , you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of .
So this is what happened on this movie , and that &apos;s how it got made , and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale , and they lent their 60 artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film .
So I want to tell you that , if you have some crazy ideas in your mind , and that people tell you well , that &apos;s an even better reason to want to do it , because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result , whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents , life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way . I have experienced it .
And you might end up doing some crazy projects , and who knows , you might even end up going to Mars .
Thank you .
Other people . Everyone is interested in other people .
Everyone has relationships with other people , and they &apos;re interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons .
Good relationships , bad relationships , annoying relationships , agnostic relationships , and what I &apos;m going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship .
So I &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in interacting with other people , I &apos;m going to completely strip it of all its complicating features , and I &apos;m going to turn that object , that simplified object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact .
But before I do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
The first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity .
Without needles and radioactivity , without any kind of clinical reason , we can go down the street and record from your friends &apos; and neighbors &apos; brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks , and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging .
You &apos;ve probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation . Let me give you a two-sentence version of it .
So we &apos;ve all heard of MRIs . MRIs use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach , grayscale images that are frozen in time .
In the 1990s , it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode , and in that mode , you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain .
Okay , so what ? In fact , the so what is , in the brain , changes in neural activity , the things that make your brain work , the things that make your software work in your brain , are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow .
You make a blood flow movie , you have an independent proxy of brain activity .
This has literally revolutionized cognitive science .
Take any cognitive domain you want , memory , motor planning , thinking about your mother-in-law , getting angry at people , emotional response , it goes on and on , put people into functional MRI devices , and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity .
It &apos;s in its early stages , and it &apos;s crude by some measures , but in fact , 20 years ago , we were at nothing .
You couldn &apos;t do people like this . You couldn &apos;t do healthy people .
That &apos;s caused a literal revolution , and it &apos;s opened us up to a new experimental preparation . Neurobiologists , as you well know , have lots of experimental preps , worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this .
And now , we have a new experimental prep : human beings .
We can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings , and we have a few burgeoning biological measures .
Okay , let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do , and it &apos;s in the area of what you &apos;d call valuation .
Valuation is just what you think it is , you know ?
If you went and you were valuing two companies against one another , you &apos;d want to know which was more valuable .
Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago .
If you want to compare oranges to windshields , what do you do ?
Well , you can &apos;t compare oranges to windshields .
They &apos;re immiscible . They don &apos;t mix with one another .
So instead , you convert them to a common currency scale , put them on that scale , and value them accordingly .
Well , your brain has to do something just like that as well , and we &apos;re now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation , and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain .
I won &apos;t go through the details of it , but that &apos;s an important discovery , and we know a good bit about that now , and it &apos;s just a small piece of it , but it &apos;s important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson &apos;s disease , and they &apos;re also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse , and that makes sense .
Drugs of abuse would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . They change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
Here &apos;s the key feature though . These neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas , and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons .
We have a behavioral superpower in our brain , and it at least in part involves dopamine .
We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea , for a mere idea . No other species can do that .
In 1997 , the cult Heaven &apos;s Gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp waiting to take them to the next level . It was an incredibly tragic event .
More than two thirds of them had college degrees .
But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive . That &apos;s a lot of control , okay ?
One thing that I &apos;ve left out of this narrative is the obvious thing , which is the focus of the rest of my little talk , and that is other people .
These same valuation systems are redeployed when we &apos;re valuing interactions with other people .
So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs , that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson &apos;s disease , that contributes to various forms of psychosis , is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you &apos;re interacting with somebody else .
Let me give you an example of this .
You bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it .
Let me just give you a few examples . So here &apos;s a baby .
She &apos;s three months old . She still poops in her diapers and she can &apos;t do calculus .
She &apos;s related to me . Somebody will be very glad that she &apos;s up here on the screen .
You can cover up one of her eyes , and you can still read something in the other eye , and I see sort of curiosity in one eye , I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other .
Here &apos;s a couple . They &apos;re sharing a moment together , and we &apos;ve even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they &apos;re sharing it . They &apos;re sharing it sort of in parallel .
Now , the elements of the scene also communicate this to us , but you can read it straight off their faces , and if you compare their faces to normal faces , it would be a very subtle cue .
Here &apos;s another couple . He &apos;s projecting out at us , and she &apos;s clearly projecting , you know , love and admiration at him .
Here &apos;s another couple . And I &apos;m thinking I &apos;m not seeing love and admiration on the left . In fact , I know this is his sister , and you can just see him saying , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re doing this for the camera , and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face . &quot; He &apos;ll kill me for showing that .
All right , so what does this mean ?
It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem .
It engages deep systems in our brain , in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex , food and salt .
They keep you alive . It gives them the pie , it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we &apos;ve called a superpower .
So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe ?
And the short answer is games .
Economic games . So what we do is we go into two areas .
One area is called experimental economics . The other area is called behavioral economics .
And we steal their games . And we contrive them to our own purposes .
So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game .
Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue . Let &apos;s say red wants to keep 70 , and offers blue 30 . So he offers a 70-30 split with blue .
Control passes to blue , and blue says , &quot; I accept it , &quot; in which case he &apos;d get the money , or blue says , &quot; I reject it , &quot; in which case no one gets anything . Okay ?
So a rational choice economist would say , well , you should take all non-zero offers .
What do people do ? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split .
At 80-20 , it &apos;s a coin flip whether you accept that or not .
Why is that ? You know , because you &apos;re pissed off .
You &apos;re mad . That &apos;s an unfair offer , and you know what an unfair offer is .
This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world .
That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe . The interesting thing is , these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line .
You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person .
You have to be able to remember what you &apos;ve done .
You have to stand up in the moment to do that .
Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back , and you have to do something that is interesting , which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay .
That is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind .
Like a job interview . You sit across the desk from somebody , they have some prior image of you , you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be .
We &apos;re so good at this we don &apos;t really even notice it .
These kinds of probes exploit it . Okay ?
In doing this , what we &apos;ve discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines .
When methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system : Hey , get out of the mine . Things aren &apos;t going so well .
People come to the table , and even these very blunt , staged social interactions , and they , and there &apos;s just numbers going back and forth between the people , and they bring enormous sensitivities to it .
So we realized we could exploit this , and in fact , as we &apos;ve done that , and we &apos;ve done this now in many thousands of people , I think on the order of five or six thousand . We actually , to make this a biological probe , need bigger numbers than that , remarkably so . But anyway , patterns have emerged , and we &apos;ve been able to take those patterns , convert them into mathematical models , and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges . Okay , so what ?
Well , the so what is , that &apos;s a really nice behavioral measure , the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play .
We can compute that during the game .
And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior .
Here &apos;s the cool thing . Six or seven years ago , we developed a team . It was at the time in Houston , Texas .
It &apos;s now in Virginia and London . And we built software that &apos;ll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet . I guess we &apos;ve done up to six machines at a time , but let &apos;s just focus on two .
So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world .
We synchronize the machines , set them into these staged social interactions , and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains . So for the first time , we don &apos;t have to look at just averages over single individuals , or have individuals playing computers , or try to make inferences that way . We can study individual dyads .
We can study the way that one person interacts with another person , turn the numbers up , and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition , but more importantly , we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses , or brain damage , into these social interactions , and use these as probes of that .
So we &apos;ve started this effort . We &apos;ve made a few hits , a few , I think , embryonic discoveries .
We think there &apos;s a future to this . But it &apos;s our way of going in and redefining , with a new lexicon , a mathematical one actually , as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness , characterizing these diseases , by using the people as birds in the exchanges . That is , we exploit the fact that the healthy partner , playing somebody with major depression , or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder , or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , we use that as a kind of biosensor , and then we use computer programs to model that person , and it gives us a kind of assay of this .
Early days , and we &apos;re just beginning , we &apos;re setting up sites around the world . Here are a few of our collaborating sites .
The hub , ironically enough , is centered in little Roanoke , Virginia .
There &apos;s another hub in London , now , and the rest are getting set up . We hope to give the data away at some stage . That &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
But we &apos;re also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings , and so I would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software , or even for guidance on how to move forward with that .
Let me leave you with one thought in closing .
The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we &apos;ve been limited , in a way .
We just haven &apos;t had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously .
The fact is , though , that even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a profoundly social creature . We &apos;re not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . In fact , our minds depend on other people . They depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
So this is the first sort of step into using that insight into what makes us human beings , turning it into a tool , and trying to gain new insights into mental illness .
Thanks for having me .
This is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
Adam Grosser : So 29 years ago , I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
It was a lot like the Stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
And it was invented in 1858 , by this guy Ferdinand Carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
One has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
You heat up one side , the hot side .
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
You let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up .
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
It topped 400 psi . The ammonia was toxic . It sprayed everywhere .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , the great thing about 2006 is there &apos;s a lot of really great computational work you can do .
So , we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. -- and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it &apos;s camel dung or wood .
It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
It looks like this . This is the fifth prototype . It &apos;s not quite done .
Weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
You put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it &apos;ll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment . It &apos;s really cheap .
We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
Thank you .
I am a writer .
Writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
And I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I &apos;m doomed .
Seriously -- doomed , doomed !
Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all , ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
And people would say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot;
Like that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
Like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
You know , is it rational ?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
You know , and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
It didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block John , how &apos;s it going ?
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
We writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; Every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
An extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
Are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assumption .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that I &apos;m in right now in my career .
Which is -- you know , like check it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
And it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh , so Jesus , what a thought !
You know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
But , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , O.K. ?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot;
Socrates , famously , believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar .
The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
They believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like Dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
So brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
If your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
If your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differently ?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
And she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
And in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s uncanny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pipeline !
I &apos;m a mule , and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
But even I , in my mulishness , even I have brushed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
And for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
But then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then I &apos;m going to be haunted by this song forever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of panicking , he just stopped .
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
He just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Excuse me , can you not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
Go bother Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
It could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom .
So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and it already saved me once .
This idea , it saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; and I fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
And I started to think I should just dump this project .
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
And I said aloud , &quot; Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
So if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
O.K. But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
Because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
But every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
It was like time would stop , and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 nights before , but everything would align .
And all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
He would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; to &quot; Ole , ole , ole , &quot; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
In Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , ole , ole , Allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of God .
Which is great , because we need that .
But , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to ascend to that height again .
And maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
And what I have to , sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
Don &apos;t be daunted .
Just do your job .
Continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to dance , do your dance .
If the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
And if not , do your dance anyhow .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless , just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ole !
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
That first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
It was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
What a fish .
Even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
So you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : How do we keep fish on our menus ?
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
Ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of arguments against it : Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . Take tuna , a major drawback .
It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
Not very sustainable .
It doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
That feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 what ? What are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; I said . Got off the phone .
And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
Let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
Thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
I fell out of love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
I actually am .
No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
She kind of set us up .
It came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
The chef had overcooked it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , it was still delicious .
Who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
It &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It &apos;s at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
Until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
They did it by draining the land .
They built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
And ecologically , it was a disaster .
It killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
What did they do ?
They reversed the flow of water .
They literally flipped the switch .
Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
They flooded the canals .
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
The farm &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
I was there not long ago with Miguel .
He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee .
Okay ? There we are slogging through the wetlands , and I &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture .
Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .
Now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
And here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
He said , &quot; Fish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
So I interrupted him . I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
He pointed at the algae .
&quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing .
But what are your fish eating ?
What &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
There is no feed .
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
Later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
At that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; Look at their bellies , pink .
They &apos;re feasting . &quot;
Feasting ? I was totally confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
Well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
He shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingos eat the shrimp .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
So the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
A fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
And every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 .
No kidding .
I was imagining a &quot; March of the Penguins &quot; thing , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it seared , I don &apos;t like it crispy .
It &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
I almost never cook with it .
Yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
It tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
He said , &quot; The skin acts like a sponge .
It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
It evolved to soak up impurities . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot;
OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , &quot; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
The system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
So , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
You might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bass or beef cattle .
What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
We &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
We love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
One billion people will go hungry today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
Our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
Want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
Instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
That &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
Look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel .
Farms that aren &apos;t worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
Because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
Several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow has to be on top .
And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
So , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
Then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! -- they admire their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
They lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
And of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti , Inc . Right ?
They don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
And then they execute on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sound familiar ? Right .
What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
So the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
Who does the very best ?
Architects and engineers , thankfully .
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
So CEOs , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
You can just tell beforehand . And why is that ?
Because they have special skills of facilitation .
They manage the process , they understand the process .
And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
If you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the result ?
Here &apos;s what happened : Not one team had a standing structure .
If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high stakes have a strong impact .
We did the exercise again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of prototyping .
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
So there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
There &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the basics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shores are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : &quot; Son , resist Gaddafi . Fight him .
But don &apos;t you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary . &quot;
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions .
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi .
And there it was , a great revolution .
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
Eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
For four decades Gaddafi &apos;s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society .
Aware of the devastation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
After a period of 33 years in exile , I went back to Libya , and with unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
Eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
However , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs .
On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law .
Our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .
Intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
I &apos;m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did not prioritize right .
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division .
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
For peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
That &apos;s the real zipper .
And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
According to a Quranic verse &quot; Salam &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the all-merciful God , raheem . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; raheem , &quot; which is known in all Abrahamic traditions , has the same root in Arabic as the word &quot; rahem &quot; -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from .
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence .
Thus we are told that &quot; My mercy encompasses all things . &quot;
Thus we are told that &quot; My mercy takes precedence over my anger . &quot;
May we all be granted a grace of mercy .
Thank you .
