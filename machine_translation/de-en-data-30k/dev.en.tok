Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
It &apos;s like the old Las Vegas used to be .
But it &apos;s not really what is probably most efficient .
For every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .

Astrology , for instance : like many rationalists , I &apos;m a Pisces .
And as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .
They &apos;ll get an incredible panorama and understand , I think more completely , the sheer totality of the destruction of the place .

But when he reached the mountain peak , he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him , each one claiming &quot; &apos; I was here first &apos; ...
What I love about this , just sort of interesting design problems .
What we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . And by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them .
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that , despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren &apos;t available previously -- we have modern composite materials , we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available , we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit -- but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective , we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years , which isn &apos;t where we want to be right now .
It &apos;s involved in learning and memory .
The teenagers said they could see very well .
As I say , we were in the infancy of digital type .
The 10 seconds actually are because we -- I don &apos;t know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord .

The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations .
It had a driver and a passenger , and after the car had passed the judge by , the passenger extended his hand , pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on , just as the teenagers had described it , right ?
He feels hot , cold , sharp , dull , all in his missing hand , or both his hand and his chest , but he can attend to either .

So , while you &apos;re trying to make up your mind what the doctor , the surgeon , is doing while he &apos;s hacking away at your body , he &apos;s long gone .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
The cybercriminals I talked about , despite theft of millions of dollars , actually still haven &apos;t been arrested , and at this point possibly never will .
I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; I don &apos;t like flowers . &quot;

Sorry , start again .
We like the ups and downs of life .
GL : No , it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape .
Yossi Vardi : This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year , known as the optical inch by Philips . Let &apos;s applaud Philips -- -- for this gesture for humanity .

And the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , &quot; Iridium Layer at the K-T Boundary , Potassium-Argon Dated Crater in Yucatan , Indicate That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs . &quot;
And we decided to take on depression , and the reason we took on depression is because it &apos;s so prevalent , and as you know , there are many treatments for depression , with medication and psychotherapy , even electroconvulsive therapy , but there are millions of people , and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression that do not respond , and it is these patients that we want to help .
It turns out , from earliest childhood , boys , and then men , prefer the company of guys -- physical company .
Here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
Alexander asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
You know , blogs are scary . This is what you see .
I had just done the long jump , and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says , &quot; How do you do that ? You know , we &apos;re supposed to have a planar foot , so we can &apos;t get off on the springboard . &quot;

But how ?
The two groups are not talking to each other .
Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars .
And so there &apos;s a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations , because they &apos;re doing things that they haven &apos;t really been trained for , and they &apos;re doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for .

Death Valley is the hottest , driest place in America , and nothing grows there .
And you can see in the images afterward , we &apos;ve managed to reconstruct her successfully .
But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that , if you look at the rate at which the infection worked , they show this spiky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .

We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy , not after the fact , commenting on a rule after it &apos;s written , the way is typically the case , but in advance . There was no legal precedent , no cultural precedent , no technical way of doing this .
So , to summarize : Prakash , in its five years of existence , it &apos;s had an impact in multiple areas , ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain , to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism , the development of autonomous machine vision systems , education of the undergraduate and graduate students , and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot;

We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia , so even though I don &apos;t know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube , I can easily picture how he did it .
So that was the reason for the project .
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .

This happens to be OK -- he &apos;s an anatomically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . Other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
These are hopping microbot swarms .
But we have to draw those people in , because this is about education .
Right . Dumbest idea ever .
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag .
And now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .

We have never had as many means of communication , means of being connected , means of reaching out , means of including .
Certainly , 10,000 years ago , the civilization &apos;s beginning , the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent . Let &apos;s look at it now .
And this gets shown in art galleries like this , as a sequence .
This kind of person would do that .
They &apos;re enriching others , not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves .

Here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer .
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;

The age is 400 years .
It won &apos;t be easy . You &apos;ll think I &apos;m strange .
