And in reality , if we fail to do things in obstacles we often feel differently . </S>
There are good reasons for it . </S>
How are the roles going on ? How do the <UNK> costumes ? </S>

That individual sequences of things you can take , if you can download from the Internet , and I was reading recently in a woman who was saying that someone was feeling like they were too dangerous by killing them with FedEx . </S>
And when I think that I believe that I &apos;m not breathing the lines , what I didn &apos;t do , I proved that your eyes have been fooled . </S>
We don &apos;t know about any life beyond Earth , but I &apos;m going to tell you that that &apos;s going to happen quite soon because it &apos;s partly changing and it &apos;s partly because in most of the ways it is most dangerous because of the crop systems are getting better . </S>
Korea invested a lot in professional life , which is a lot of cooperation and a lot . </S>

In fact , there are 4,000 on the sea as many as land . </S>
I &apos;m listening to the physician . &quot; So we would love to do this , but get liberated from the family . </S>
And so we &apos;re interested in looking at the kind of space for the individual &apos;s life to look at the individual sitting there ? </S>

Will any energy imply in their life ? </S>
And all of these sequences are <UNK> when I see anything , or I hear something that reminds me of it , and it will automatically hear me . </S>
But the idea that with just limited charges in this situation , we just simply simply don &apos;t think and it &apos;s even dangerous because that means we &apos;re not going to take on what &apos;s going to happen . </S>
There were plenty of models for us everywhere . </S>
How long was I supposed to stay in that factory ? </S>
Could it happen so much in other <UNK> ? </S>
So we &apos;re sitting on a planet right now from the very simple reason that it has the ability to access to us that are vital to us . </S>
But in spite of that challenge , I &apos;m still still a huge digital optimist , and I &apos;m sure that digital technology that we &apos;re developing at the moment we &apos;re going to become a <UNK> future in the future , and it &apos;s not a viable future . </S>
When he did that , the thing he noticed was that his client was for the back of the house was an <UNK> , because they were words . </S>

The one into his arm &apos;s worth of sight and got separated from him -- his <UNK> , like a <UNK> cop . </S>
I think it was a <UNK> thing . </S>

This is &quot; by the National <UNK> and Space Safety Administration . &quot; </S>
We don &apos;t know exactly , but there are theories . </S>
I met her in the early &apos; 90s . </S>
So I &apos;m not saying that the cost of life at the occasion is the thing for every thing to do . </S>
In those days , I was alive . </S>
That membranes are also similar to structure , and it &apos;s functional to the texture in your body and we can use them , and we can use them , kind of , to build the body of our protocell . </S>
They &apos;d like the next to be <UNK> . </S>
Just when I was approaching my new life , I received a book officer . </S>
So I &apos;m thinking about this how we do the way we do all kinds of things can be <UNK> , so that at the end of that sort of sounds , right ? </S>
There &apos;s a discrepancy that can be predicted . </S>
And so we won the World Cup in 1983 . </S>
One in tons per person . </S>

When I was at 16 in San Francisco , I had my seminal <UNK> symbol while I was holding my back to Jesus Christ . </S>
Not all of these are new species -- for example of the fish there with the white <UNK> , the kind of thing . </S>
In fact , when India was growing at three and a half percent and a half percent , and the population was two percent , doubling per capita income per 45 . </S>
As a consequence , the body develops more known as a result of that . </S>
We don &apos;t have the protection of the identity . </S>
And I called this &quot; a bit from less for more and more people : &quot; <UNK> . &quot; </S>
The challenge is to think in new ways . I think wood could be part of the solution and I can tell you why . </S>
On the left , it &apos;s <UNK> by one , two or three dollars . They &apos;re half the time , and at 4 a.m. , five dollars , there &apos;s a lot better . </S>
If you want to do a movement , you have the courage to follow and follow them to others like you . </S>
What about time and gas ? </S>
They have their structure . </S>
If you ask yourself , &quot; How or why ? All of us look in the other way . </S>
These are <UNK> arrays on a road where there are many <UNK> . </S>
Africa is connecting with the rest of the world and itself . </S>
Some of them look like places I &apos;ve used to be used as a graduate student . </S>
When was the last time a newspaper taken on her hand , and the headline was &quot; The boy was Lunch of asthma . &quot; </S>

My mother in May were 18 when her father died -- -- in a <UNK> marriage , already with two little girls . </S>

HP : As you can see , it is obviously the most potent risks that we face . </S>
No job is always a good starting . </S>
Could they turn them up and help them make <UNK> to <UNK> ? </S>
They need nine hours to get a full lease and a lot of you just get five hours outside of school . </S>
We were focused on North East and West Kerry , which is the two areas that I &apos;m most interested in . </S>
Just to pay and write about his knees and his <UNK> . </S>
In the next January , people feel that if they save more , more than less , that &apos;s painful . </S>
The <UNK> has shown in the stories of the boys . </S>
So we sent one in the space station . </S>

His grandmother was left and gone from her little girl . </S>
&quot; <UNK> , North Carolina , 1999 . </S>

I have no idea what &apos;s &quot; business &quot; thing . </S>
And that &apos;s the thing about the <UNK> for 150 people in the last summer , but much more importantly is what you don &apos;t plan . </S>
I know . How many people have gone through the last 10 years . </S>
We don &apos;t want to guess about our ancestry , things , possible , possible ancestors from the ground from the ground and note from the harsh ones that we don &apos;t need to understand . We don &apos;t understand the genetic causes for the most fundamental shifts . We have to challenge that problem . </S>
And I &apos;m thinking , what do I do here ? Why am I here ? </S>
So here &apos;s the thing . It &apos;s a guy &apos;s old . It &apos;s a little piano guy . </S>
But in that crowd were a tiny , small group , a minority and a minority of a minority a minority and these nearby group had a new and dangerous attitude from the jihad and from that time there was this class among the leadership of Osama bin Laden and he came up with the idea . </S>
There &apos;s a group in Germany who begin to start to engineer light and lights out to be dark . </S>
<UNK> . </S>
So if that &apos;s how much of an animal being emitted , it will continue to become like my <UNK> and my <UNK> , and I &apos;m going to <UNK> over the <UNK> world like a character from a novel by a novel <UNK> . </S>
This guy is called &quot; <UNK> , &quot; &quot; which is about Fire with Fire , &quot; and you can just look at him -- that &apos;s his character . </S>
We just had about a dozen of the people on the sea floor . </S>
And instead of 100 percent of that we &apos;re taking off by 100 percent by 25 percent . </S>
And it &apos;s extremely heavy at all . </S>
But , networks are markets where local food became local . </S>
And this is what I mean in the field of action . </S>
I am talking from Ritalin , Viagra , things like Prozac . </S>
The <UNK> type of <UNK> or oil or -- we didn &apos;t know what to do . </S>
And that female will immediately mate with a male mating , because they &apos;re not at a time . </S>
What you saw in Katrina is a very good example of how little at the United States did for any major attack . </S>
You know , we have arguments that we make a standstill . </S>
Another disaster is in a public record in San <UNK> California . </S>
This is called &quot; <UNK> of <UNK> . &quot; </S>
We &apos;ve all had time . </S>
When you had to give them four very good friends of a person who had a person . </S>
I thought it was slightly easy to do , but I wrote about 200 people emails who lived in an <UNK> in my home bed and had just been an <UNK> for a collaboration . </S>
And by the time in three days , we built a system together for every system that allows anyone to share a little bit more than what &apos;s currently going on . </S>
Because architecture is the way I think about it . </S>
Although , to me , that was not about my art at the heart of life , it was very good . </S>
And this area that we see here is 4.6 billion years old by the time that we saw Earth and Mars . </S>
But if you take the same genealogy and connect them to another level , you get a diamond which is clear and hard . </S>
But first of all , you wonder . How do you know that ant is that it is like a forager for most of us . </S>
For years , I &apos;ve enjoyed that stress made a sick . </S>
I remember when I ate the eyes of a fish directly from the sea because he said it was food to your brain . </S>
<UNK> adapt to the possibility to use that productive potential , and you get cities like you know , and you get all of the non-zero-sum games that you do that are not going to be able to play around for the world . </S>
And of course , I was , of course , like , &quot; why happened to me . &quot; </S>
And that gives us the mythology of the puzzle . </S>
And that worked . gave him a guy . </S>
And I think these words are bringing it to the point : &quot; It means a society that is based on the expectation of the civil society . </S>
When we learn from <UNK> , we will take a few of them , but there are other practices that we do when we listen to them , we may be <UNK> and envy us and wonder whether we want to adopt these practices . </S>
Women in Uganda that did include the <UNK> in V-Day crime in the year , they even turned to the rage of the government . </S>
In 2004 I launched <UNK> <UNK> , and our first year went very well very well for the first year , but no call . </S>
And the first thing I thought was him to thank him for making it . </S>
It can even turn to the old-growth <UNK> , or the grass , another new type of <UNK> , for example , get coffee , or suction from winter for the winter . </S>
We , a majority , don &apos;t know all of that . </S>
The transistor was a small pajama ball that took us from a world of the <UNK> , <UNK> building blocks into a planet in which everything was interactive . </S>
And that was what led me to do me with the questions that made me . </S>
But the most exciting thing that came to do was to force us to do the international community , every single child , every single community -- the <UNK> people in this world from <UNK> health , independent of geography , ethnic , cultural and extinct conflict . </S>
Your brand starts to be <UNK> . And it &apos;s going to happen . </S>
I never saw anyone who feels he feels by someone that he needed him . </S>
An incredible regularity . </S>
And just about 34 years ago , I have other people with my <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , because to be honest , my whistling is an <UNK> . </S>
It sounds like it &apos;s a old teacher teacher writing me . </S>
What we wanted to do is try to understand carefully how the reality of parenting life . </S>
And we didn &apos;t stop at <UNK> : &quot; before eight hours , we &apos;d nearly died ! &quot; </S>
And if we look at our lifetimes , then we actually picked the best part of the tuna . </S>
And I thought I was just trying to <UNK> nature , nature . </S>
Everybody who &apos;s going to do it right now at the same time , and the only way to do that is when all of the people are together to share the information and get to the information . </S>
Seven feet tall high feet tall , 130 feet , growing very tightly in that area . </S>
They even make a living . </S>
If you write about a parasite , she serves the vocabulary of a shape plot like &quot; Life <UNK> and &quot; bursts from his body . &quot; </S>
More than make more sell more , more of the more . </S>
Because again , before the fate of the individual people and the fate of the whole species has been divergent from all of us . </S>
They didn &apos;t get resolved because they were in the chicken , but by the California <UNK> 65 years old because they said that there are dangerous pieces of products from the companies that have to be <UNK> by the companies . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> : And I am <UNK> . </S>
At the way home they were stopped by a policeman and the bottom name was like Titus &apos;s car similar to a car . </S>
Obviously , for the first hours of lunch , no , no . </S>
So these bees don &apos;t necessarily have a new problem . It &apos;s been <UNK> years for a number of years . </S>
I promise , they &apos;re reading the news . </S>
They wear a flower belly from one flower to another . </S>
What have we to take away for ourselves as an message ? </S>
It &apos;s like a mechanical trick . </S>
We seem to be more of a little bit more effective in the way . </S>
It was beginning to transform the next generation , new ways of design , and also productivity increased weight or a lot of the weight . </S>
So you can download products from the Internet -- everything you spend on your desk likes your pencils , your pencils , whistling . </S>
But we &apos;re literally just <UNK> . </S>
Thank you . </S>
This is the tunnel . </S>
In the stage of a piece of uranium from a piece of dough I was a student student and an <UNK> for them . </S>
You &apos;re going to be able to use its proteins , its RNA , its DNA , whatever . </S>
Kids became an <UNK> , and fewer screaming . </S>
That &apos;s especially why it &apos;s currently built because of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on their <UNK> . </S>
This is even at the <UNK> of the <UNK> ; it &apos;s one of the <UNK> <UNK> , the hero of our American workers , published up and calls &quot; a few reasons for the Chinese justice system : meat versus rice : American manhood to <UNK> against <UNK> : what should survive ? &quot; </S>
I was trying to find the scientific origin for the number of that number , but I could never have done it . </S>
Speaking of the talk , it &apos;s a complete mess . </S>
Oh , it &apos;s a great honor to do , and it &apos;s wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that truly changes in the world . </S>
But the point is , the most beautiful work that we want to do is that the <UNK> work that we think is just <UNK> for at complete . </S>
It feels less positive , less optimistic about the size of the <UNK> to speak about how to think about how to make the cake a cake . </S>
But <UNK> is everywhere . </S>
The third of three billion people in refugee camps for people who are displaced from their homes , from the <UNK> government , the so-called <UNK> , the <UNK> , to maintain these people to the lives that make things done to otherwise . </S>
Sometimes that sometimes we look at things on the cell phones , the bigger than the telephone . </S>
To be a boy means not to be a girl . </S>
It was a chaotic thing . </S>
I was saying to my engineers : &quot; We are going to be in Walter Reed and you &apos;re going to see a lot of the people who are missing parts of the body . </S>
Now , it &apos;s launch now . </S>
What would happen ? &quot; </S>
And it was -- of course , it was very funny . </S>
And when they climb on the rock where they are still staying , it locks as a first flash of your own brain and into a nervous system as a food . </S>
You know , when I was a <UNK> physicist , I was talking to the Chinese movement with them and they always responded to me in English . </S>
But equally important is that we do as a visual of our fears , how we read our fears may have great differences in our lives . </S>
So , like an <UNK> <UNK> built , first by the first line , by the first line , by verification . </S>
Now here &apos;s the first step , it &apos;s very simple . </S>
Thanks . </S>
I &apos;m just going to mention just a few of them , so you have a notion of diversity and the powerful potential . </S>
We can &apos;t guarantee that everyone is a long and healthy life . </S>
I started as a programmer . Then I worked for a number of years as a writer , for about 20 years -- in my <UNK> and now in advertising and we &apos;ve just begun to start with the picture . </S>
Thank you . </S>
One of them might actually see the right number of patterns to win the Nobel Prize . </S>
But that &apos;s not the really crazy transformation in the middle that we live . </S>
They help make him stick through by simple forces on surfaces . </S>
I think some people are concerned about it . </S>
We didn &apos;t get ready and we gave the help of help . </S>
And we can use special cameras to see . </S>

&quot; <UNK> affect <UNK> &quot; is good when it comes to areas that achieve very <UNK> very expensive for the moment in the moment . </S>
You &apos;re going to see it in a graph like this from an infrastructure to a new public space . </S>
A little bit , I think that &apos;s what makes a sting , but there &apos;s something a lot bigger . </S>
So let &apos;s talk about why whales are the whales for the ocean of the ocean so important . </S>
They understand what &apos;s inside you and does create a sort of <UNK> relationship between you and your technology so that you can use that information to get yourself forward . </S>
We create space in between behavior . </S>
From Nick <UNK> , the director of the National Theatre , he saw -- he had close to his names . </S>
It &apos;s even worse . Let me show you through that . </S>
I lost my whole audience . </S>
We &apos;ve got to invest in women because it &apos;s our only chance of living the war in the future . </S>
It &apos;s to be the system . </S>
You &apos;re surprised to be alive . </S>
And we leave everything from that table , 72 percent of the planet . </S>
But for me to use sustainability as a set of choice as a criteria as a criteria to enhance solutions solutions , because how I just showed you , are these simple products that are contributing to these huge issues . </S>
I told the Bill <UNK> and he said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll take everybody . &quot; </S>
They are within our own backyard . </S>
To conclude I &apos;d like to show you the latest Model of our conservation drone . </S>
It &apos;s like being alive to earn a living not to make HIV positive . </S>
We have to make our voice heard . We have to make a solution for that democracy -- we have an <UNK> in our democracies . And that &apos;s what we need to change . </S>
But they had the same patterns and matched in pattern . </S>
It was made of glass , and the building was a blessing for my job . </S>
I must go to school . I got a job . my kids get kids to class — &quot; They think , &quot; I am too busy . I don &apos;t have time for art . &quot; </S>
But we &apos;re going to space right into a huge crisis , and I &apos;d like to conclude by the people . </S>
And this -- using computation to do the calculation and building things through that kind of thing , which is something that also has to do with Craig Venter . </S>
You know when kids do your children at home ? </S>
So why are we doing it all ? Why do we build this satellite ? </S>
They &apos;re unique <UNK> . </S>
Is that any information ? Well , let me run back to 2008 . </S>
And we depend on others . We depend on a meme . </S>
Just than that most of the time here today , most of the time you can &apos;t figure out how to do the data that you can read a 3D printer . </S>
So this kind of conversation that men get involved in every age , that &apos;s so critical and important and important , and I think that &apos;s as much more important than the funding that we get . </S>
Two thirds of the women in the <UNK> have collapsed retain , and so mammography doesn &apos;t work very well for them . </S>
So as soon as that crab touch it , they move back into structures like <UNK> . </S>
People have a fair concern about the balance between transparency and <UNK> . </S>
What she wanted to do was make a difference in her life . </S>
So here &apos;s what happened is that you have learned this learning process to create a new team for that new social social group . </S>
You know , they &apos;re going to get boats very fast . </S>
I &apos;m research on breast cancer . </S>
So while the other three piles of <UNK> became dark and <UNK> , and the <UNK> <UNK> -- <UNK> <UNK> -- in eight weeks and 10,000 million pounds -- in 10,000 pounds a growth rate -- in less than 200 million pounds . </S>
Let me leave you with good news , and maybe some bad . </S>
<UNK> and Wilbur . </S>
They are <UNK> just like children . </S>
Welcome to 3,000 3,000 . </S>
All of that is possible with a cell phone . </S>
We didn &apos;t get a money for that study because , for example , because <UNK> do children don &apos;t have any meaningful contribute to science . That &apos;s what teachers said . </S>
And our younger generations is going to transform this country as it transforms itself . </S>
Thank you . </S>
It &apos;s clear when you want to help people , you &apos;ve got to where the people are . </S>
And this is how you do an <UNK> . </S>
But it &apos;s not just about me . </S>
I &apos;m not playing ahead of you . </S>
If you &apos;ve seen the pictures -- it &apos;s like it &apos;s going to be in the <UNK> . It &apos;s a <UNK> . </S>
I have a plan for it . I want to persuade people to say , including all of you to spend a lot of time with the play and making fun and enjoyable games . </S>
Now , what &apos;s happening here ? Why do women get women and girls and boys and young people and emotionally emotionally and emotionally in other ways that they claim to love to love , and what happens to these men ? </S>
But I &apos;m afraid that what I &apos;ve been trained the last 10 years of others is to do more harm than the good , and it &apos;s associated with stress . </S>
It &apos;s not just about the sake of the wars of the wars , even though there are still any war . </S>
Europe and the United States didn &apos;t seem that much disturbing me because they were both too good . So it became Asia . </S>
This is an <UNK> long term . </S>
Now , that has to do with the brain . </S>
One of the other journalists said , &quot; What happens there ? &quot; </S>
So with stories about remarkable people , like I thought I &apos;d begin with my mom . </S>
We &apos;ve done all of the papers with the whole last experiment , and they &apos;d say we would give us the money to give us the money they didn &apos;t get away . OK ? </S>
Six months at the time , the nerves became very good , and you could see tremendous contractions . </S>
She could do it alone . </S>
We &apos;re going to hear from two people who are affected by the laws . </S>
He was wearing a green mask that we could take later off in the <UNK> layer and replace it through the head of Robert <UNK> . </S>
So , <UNK> , a big joke and -- like my , philosopher , notice that they have to follow the ignorance of a vague message . </S>
And the school tools allow me to translate an essential way of making information without knowing it . </S>
In the world of weblogs , it will be a time and a time later for the tsunami -- because one of the things that happened for the tsunami -- although first -- there was barely little <UNK> and there weren &apos;t really -- and there were a lot of a lot . </S>
I &apos;d like to tell you about two <UNK> . </S>
Well , to say that was some slightly unfair from the great great Joseph song who was making fun of half an amazing composer in the second half of the 18th century , he had spent the <UNK> of his life as a <UNK> employee <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> . </S>
On the second hand they should all <UNK> back . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> : I couldn &apos;t wait at the boat . </S>
And this at the <UNK> of that morning we can lay down the hill . </S>
But it &apos;s because Wikipedia didn &apos;t just spontaneously . </S>
Without needles or contracts . One in clinical trials we can take on the street and solve the brain activity of friends and neighbors with solutions that are providing various tasks , and we &apos;re using a process that is called functional magnetic resonance imaging . </S>
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and Jerusalem in Jerusalem . </S>
I &apos;m going to be that he was pretty laughing at it . </S>
If we treat the <UNK> relations , the more people like the people , the better they will work with each other . </S>
It &apos;s a <UNK> who has already been a <UNK> , an international peace . </S>
RSW : That &apos;s the thing it ever ? </S>
<UNK> , their dinosaurs , they learn by it . </S>
So they are increasingly concerned . </S>
We also found these spectacular coral vent debris from solid hot springs into the <UNK> . </S>
And to build a broadband platform for an industrial highway , that incredible wild nature would change today that is basically a gorgeous decline on the planet for today . </S>
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness . </S>
And within six months , they become too risk-averse . </S>
This is as close as China &apos;s about a spiritual role . </S>
And because the Brits were still terrified about their defeat in the revolution , they decided to get him in an awkward way by making a picture of General Air Force into the single <UNK> just where he had to see . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> was ever asked by a nine-year-old joke by what he could do , and <UNK> <UNK> said , &quot; Get out there and tell someone to someone . &quot; </S>
And one of the most unique forces that we &apos;ve seen that we &apos;re involved with -- actually , that could be <UNK> difficult temperatures . </S>
<UNK> is great with a good mood . </S>
Now , who are these scientists and engineers at this magical place for DARPA ? </S>
I went to jail -- difficult . </S>
And suddenly , suddenly , a whole piece blew up . </S>
But I went on to tell you that he thinks that that he did not everything that was pretty good at the fact that he had calculated the number of years of life that he had other people . The <UNK> looked like what he could have done if he had 5,000 dollars at the point of the <UNK> Foundation . </S>
And if I say just a story : &quot; I don &apos;t try and my work <UNK> . &quot; </S>
They still don &apos;t know exactly that day , but look at it . </S>
I think you &apos;re the best person to get what you want , or what you want to do to make the change that you want to make change by being able to <UNK> your idea . </S>
Cyrus starts at full of 539 B.C. </S>
But what I wanted to talk about is they &apos;re the two names that sparked the prior response of the earlier principles that came back in the <UNK> reviews that were published on &quot; The Blank <UNK> . &quot; </S>
Because for example , if you didn &apos;t know that , 20 percent of black and <UNK> , who started an education in Science or an experiment where only 32 percent of the white people begin to start in those areas actually succeed and a degree in those areas and only 42 percent of the Americans . </S>
One big thing is , of course , from the <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
Isn &apos;t it &quot; ? </S>
But if those <UNK> or <UNK> came out in the wrong gene , it could be that we feel sick . </S>
By 1984 , there were more women dying in the United States than men . </S>
That &apos;s not actually not hard for it . </S>
Models are not static . </S>
In London for example , where the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> office for heavy <UNK> British <UNK> for 10 years every year for a number of them , a certain kind of adjacent country that was bought for 44 and a half of the country that &apos;s feeding for 44 billion pounds . </S>
So , it &apos;s <UNK> water . </S>
Well , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us . </S>
And then we began with a new set of life -- from a completely different perspective . </S>
The first is modifying women in the workforce . </S>
She accelerates the pace by which the body cures himself compared to that in a clinically relevant amount of time . </S>
In fact , for a dollar permit , you can hear about this kind of silence that is different from other forms of silence . </S>
<UNK> is at the bottom of the right , on the right side of bloggers and authors . </S>
The problem with this is that two very large <UNK> have hope to be in <UNK> . </S>
I was telling you that there are good news . </S>
The <UNK> doesn &apos;t make any sense . </S>
But we have to continue that journey , and we &apos;ve got to tell people to say , and we need to prove that it could work . &quot; </S>
For my bit , I think that &apos;s a success because I don &apos;t want to make any difference in government any other than it is trying to make things better for the Internet . </S>
<UNK> to <UNK> to 60 percent of the weight of the oil and breast cancer . </S>
In the <UNK> , in 2010 , shortly after <UNK> death , came our curator for <UNK> , Andrew <UNK> to me and said , &quot; I thought I &apos;d been walking around <UNK> , now the moment . We &apos;ve got to do that . &quot; </S>
And the &quot; 99 &quot; was going to be the kind of like the superheroes about what just happened in the world . </S>
And the fact that atoms , if you light them , only light specifically in particular colors , was one of the key engines that led to the development of quantum theory together , the theory of the atoms . </S>
You can collect <UNK> , and the Desert of &#91; unclear &#93; . </S>
This is an image of an <UNK> of <UNK> . </S>
The envelope was also money . </S>
This is not going to happen and it &apos;s going to die . </S>
But the Victorians could . </S>
This message , every single Earth account for any country on Iraq and got 10 times the columns in comparison for the IPCC . </S>
Most of the world leaders didn &apos;t work on attention and ones that were doing it , they thought it was &quot; <UNK> economics . &quot; </S>
Whatever that is what is your call . </S>
It &apos;s not something that became <UNK> . </S>
You can learn a lot about how to eat and learn about things that are very rare . </S>
Well , we &apos;re a little <UNK> to replace the ugly ideas -- -- and try to replace bad ideas by good ideas . </S>
The growth of me is a professor in public health for the most important role in development because it &apos;s 80 percent of the <UNK> . </S>
So they went on . </S>
That &apos;s not what I need to write down . </S>
For example , we have the tendency to see faces . </S>
They may be intuitively , be rational . </S>
And <UNK> the <UNK> . </S>
&quot; The research conducted a woman with a Capgras syndrome who <UNK> over her <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> . &quot; </S>
And they were playing with you for a couple of hours . </S>
As a chemist , I &apos;m going to take maybe from some sort of <UNK> control , and I &apos;d like to think about features . </S>
And I &apos;m never going to forget exactly how I heard the story of Dr. Rachel <UNK> who told me how her grandfather she had told that he had been doing something that had happened at the beginning of creation and the original light from the universe to countless chunks . </S>
<UNK> tracking radio waves from very delicate antennae and <UNK> , the precise principles about what &apos;s an ideal object and where the night sky is . </S>
It &apos;s a story of a <UNK> in <UNK> . </S>
Now , of course , it &apos;s a very primitive machine , but we also work at <UNK> . Hopefully the cube like a powder you do . </S>
Anyone can imagine a <UNK> . </S>
One of them , number one , is the ratio of <UNK> of Indian families per capita . </S>
A world : <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> anything faster and faster and faster in less and less time . </S>
They &apos;re going to see a lot of people in my photos I met very close to where I &apos;ve just met a family member . </S>
I &apos;d like to see it if consciousness was involved . Or if any other technologically advanced people get bored with them . </S>
But I &apos;m very interested in religion , and the origin of religion , and what it is doing and do for us . </S>
So I &apos;m going to show you that less stuff and less place to make a smaller difference . </S>
Three women take their hand and I have a question for five years now for women in the world and the percentage of the list is almost always the same . </S>
At some point it would probably take a few days to get that from hand . </S>
Now , prior to a depth perspective , a ring of inches diameter is packed into a screen of an experiment . </S>
My ideal world is a place where nobody is left behind where everyone is needed where they are , like the fibers and <UNK> in a bow , a location where the <UNK> are flexible , and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
And I didn &apos;t have to leave that feeling . </S>
I still live in the present tense -- I love the present . </S>
Everybody else is , &quot; they say . </S>
You can do a game from getting you to find a one that I forgot : or try to cut them down to four , but they will lose . </S>
So when I was starting to talk to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell that story , they said , &quot; No , &quot; No , I want you to tell a story . </S>
How often are you calling them to write ? </S>
At 200 years before , Francis <UNK> and later Isaac Law was suggested a <UNK> scientific approach . </S>
And since I don &apos;t know it , they have to figure out the answers . </S>
Vannevar Bush with his <UNK> -- the idea of making the whole knowledge of humanity available -- he had that vision . </S>
People were able to recover from having to have to face it without getting to have a fear in their own prison to take them into prison . </S>
I couldn &apos;t resist , and I was leaving a <UNK> <UNK> by a woman who said , &quot; That &apos;s too awkward and severe to make fun of it . They were to be ashamed of , I &apos;m sorry to be on our website . &quot; </S>
And suddenly , from chaos . All right . </S>
You kind of didn &apos;t see it all the time , that it doesn &apos;t matter much of us . </S>
Those different mice are different mutations and show different species of blindness that people can do . </S>
We live in a more complicated world . reality is changing time . </S>
When I was sitting there in bed , I was thinking , &quot; Are you just give us a little bit to commit you , you &apos;re not going to your doctor &apos;s paying attention to your foot . &quot; </S>
But think of a grumpy couple , like my friends &apos; Sarah and Emily . </S>
And we need all of food . </S>
But the mapping in the rich world -- where there &apos;s a -- it &apos;s not based on caution ; it &apos;s based on caution ; it &apos;s based on signals -- to find the way from which the economists believe they will have the lowest effect on our GDP . </S>
Like for example , it &apos;s a <UNK> thing , or why the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> , or how do an iPod responds to your home . </S>
They reduce the risk of food . </S>
He &apos;s going to have to look down and down twice and say , &quot; What ? &quot; </S>
And sometimes I ask myself a real celebrity experience with someone that looks just like very similar to what &apos;s totally embarrassing . </S>
Sweden was like Mozambique . </S>
Patient : You &apos;re about somebody else . </S>
Well , it was , ironically , and very <UNK> , even how we found our grave . </S>
It would be fantastic if they could have the power to make a difference from the <UNK> ideas that make a lasting , that seemed to make our world peace . </S>
Another third of the energy for a <UNK> is about its <UNK> . </S>
And I took the controls and went . </S>
Thank you . SP : Thank you . </S>
The <UNK> is so strong that it was very useful for getting into the workforce . </S>
In 2004 , a researcher in 2004 was a professional research student , and was eaten by a leopard leopard seal . </S>
If I , for example , know how many stars there are in the <UNK> are how old the big minds are at the Easter of the Easter , most of you could figure out the truth without standing up at all . </S>
Harold and I -- -- throw all of that now . This situation has caught me on the wrong little page , but that was really not very surprised to me . </S>
We used a Google . </S>
Would you spend your extra amount of money to replace it ? </S>
So in response to believe these things are things that have a danger left . </S>
And that &apos;s the highest honor that could be trained for an architect in Switzerland -- having to have a <UNK> . </S>
But what brings that worm carry ? </S>
How valuable for the value was that experience ? </S>
And , unfortunately , local junior high school wouldn &apos;t offer it to me . </S>
The audience in England are familiar with the equivalent of a famous case by a woman named Sally Clark whose two children suddenly died . </S>
This is one of the <UNK> -- one of the <UNK> models that came together with Ushahidi . </S>
The people who built it back , they came back ; they had the questions for the government . </S>
We had very long beginnings of temporary light bulbs that took five minutes to warm . And then everything was in a flowing light . </S>
Who makes it artifacts ? How did they get ? </S>
I was talking to a group of about 300 children between six and eight years old for children in a museum , and I brought a bag full of legs similar to the ones that you see on top here , and I spent on the children in a table . </S>
And I touched it and realized , &quot; Oh my God , it &apos;s an <UNK> . &quot; </S>
Now metaphor is important because they affect our decisions by using analogies . </S>
How could I have been to think that we will ever get it to understand ? </S>
You know , they &apos;re usually illiterate their parents and they come up in their city and their own way they take them off at night or their weekends . They &apos;re teaching and learn how to write very simple things , like how to write a <UNK> or how to tell you a simple thing . </S>
And when some of the homeless land , they also had a former military <UNK> that they figured out , &quot; You &apos;re not homeless . Why are you right there ? &quot; </S>
It &apos;s amazing that you can see a mushroom in a spectrum of a spectrum . </S>
Speaking of <UNK> : <UNK> is <UNK> , particularly in <UNK> , although about a few weeks ago a couple of weeks ago , this will land on your table -- not a year but very quickly because they &apos;re very heavy . </S>
It &apos;s so important that just the techniques that we use to understand ourselves around the world to understand how these things look like . </S>
I &apos;m leaving my <UNK> . It was all very well I think that all of it is in everything . </S>
She goes home for 50 miles long for the ride and back to saving any other day . </S>
They &apos;re also a chance for us for a week at October that time to stop and change our time and how to look forward by year &apos;s year . </S>
But if you want to come alive and fall in love in love with the person who want to come home , I think you &apos;ve got to take care of nowhere . </S>
And it was like a lot of fun that I decided to do more things like that . </S>
And you can also see here , the purchase , very cleverly , <UNK> , <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
One day , a brilliant volunteer in our team came back and said , &quot; You know what happened to me ? </S>
Rory , thank you . </S>
When we first recorded as a species that was recorded -- a hundred of the brain cells at the same time -- we were able to measure the electricity from a hundred of a hundred cells in a animal , that &apos;s the first picture of that . </S>
Thank you . </S>
But what was interesting to me was that everybody was actually empowered by the fact that they had never been taught before . </S>
That city was founded by 800 . </S>
We have a chapter about lying . </S>
But the donors said , of course , &quot; <UNK> , try and do this . &quot; </S>
How do we solve the smoke ? Well , two things happen , and design should be at more than one thing . </S>
Metaphor matters because they &apos;re alive all the time and all the time . </S>
I took just this picture three days after her to return ; she was wearing this <UNK> couple couple tribe , from her toes strapped back to the front . </S>
Now , on the end of YouTube and YouTube . </S>
All right . Okay . I clap . </S>
It &apos;s about us and our greed and our <UNK> and our <UNK> to imagine a world that is different than the <UNK> world in which we live today . </S>
I didn &apos;t know where I went from where I came from , and I was panicked . I had a complete asteroid emptying . </S>
When you look back at a billion years back , they will get away faster . </S>
It has never been shown . </S>
So , ladies and gentlemen : I am happy to do that in the 21st century , which is what India does . </S>
So I hope that I showed you that <UNK> are not just <UNK> green spots up the top high school in the <UNK> for the <UNK> and Jane affected , but instead for making those organisms to foster more greenhouse gases in the ecosystem but also help maintain our global climate . </S>
Now , let me give you a couple of others to give you a lot of interesting examples . </S>
It was a curious woman who was walking on a computer called <UNK> at the time . </S>
It &apos;s like a guy to ask for someone to swallow the sun . </S>
That &apos;s interesting because it &apos;s opportunity to prove whether these exotic objects exist or not . </S>
These are the applications for which I work . </S>
And you know something about it right here . </S>
<UNK> to raise diversity , they give them your neighbors in the dialogue , they increase creativity , they deliver creativity , they provide opportunities for <UNK> ; they enhance our common psychological well-being . </S>
But would they have to have the future criminals that are having a lot of faith ? </S>
Are we seen in the middle of something an interesting historical memory , versus your mind ? </S>
We just wait for somebody who leads us . &quot; </S>
What we do in the lab is actually going to actually measure how the impact of video games on the brain . </S>
Obviously , we don &apos;t have that word for that . </S>
So they &apos;re going to see pictures of that remarkable building . </S>
However , whatever position you have in life is it &apos;s a must-do to create opportunities for children , like us growing up and make yourself <UNK> . </S>
She is three and a half hours off of San Francisco from San Francisco in the mountains of Sierra Nevada off in 2000 . I think for many of the years . </S>
And to <UNK> <UNK> forests . The <UNK> <UNK> came into fashion . </S>
So , welcome to the Golden <UNK> . </S>
Finally , the most mature astronauts that they use is not very often with <UNK> , but preferred the journey with <UNK> snakes . </S>
They remember 9 / 11 , we were faced with a theoretical phenomenon that George W. Bush said , &quot; Islam means peace . &quot; </S>
<UNK> judgments to be abstract <UNK> and form the process that we all discover what we know . </S>
If you had to give me a quick tour of life , not about the past , but 400 years of clustering in what we can see is that cities are living habitats for people and who need to support what people need : a full-time , food or food or food or mineral protection . </S>
I was called the <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
So I cannot make a funny story about these <UNK> , and there is no sign that they do themselves . </S>
It was like an intensive care unit in water . </S>
And the algorithms that show us aren &apos;t really bad . </S>
That &apos;s the kind of tune we all face today . </S>
In the big rains in the sacrifices . </S>
And I thought , &quot; How ? Like it ? I lost everything that I assessed everything I went into . </S>
It &apos;s totally personal . </S>
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how large these collections are or how big the images are . </S>
Today , developing countries don &apos;t have much of the solutions that are intended for by the United States , Europe or the World Bank . </S>
I always wanted to think about the corner . </S>
There &apos;s a road , beat two flies . </S>
This year alone , they gave 40 million service up for 50 dollars like <UNK> and <UNK> , solar power to help solve the people who are struggling with their problems . </S>
And just to use what they have and he goes into and do a <UNK> studio from there . </S>
You have 48 hours of time to come into the end . </S>
Between our Native Americans , they have European worms that go back into the Mediterranean Sea . </S>
These are the galleries with the light that comes from the middle stages , and here &apos;s walking around at night and on day . </S>
And everything is dependent on the ideas of that man , <UNK> Thomas <UNK> , who was a statistician and a mathematician at the <UNK> . </S>
And of course , she looked at me as a nine-year-old looking for her for nine-year-olds , and he said , &quot; What is oxytocin ? &quot; </S>
So we have that feeling that a successful cure for girls have built up for girls . </S>
It could replace or <UNK> . </S>
Well , of course one day , in the middle of the future , a technology of belief will be invented even more powerful than PowerPoint , the dancers make sense of the rhetoric . </S>
Well , a question for that time I &apos;ve been getting that talk about a long time -- so I thought they wanted to answer them again . What happens to the animal ? </S>
The thing about sustainability of sustainability is that you have to <UNK> them . </S>
We just took a few hundred people who got it . </S>
That &apos;s what we use of a shadow . </S>
We find numerous quantities of <UNK> <UNK> along that mountain range , but that was giving birth to anything else that we discovered . </S>
He realized evolution was a very smart process . </S>
They said , oh , they don &apos;t have to do that . </S>
So , it &apos;s just one application . Incredible : there &apos;s probably just 350 of 400 applications . </S>
You know , my work is about the experience of that work . </S>
Not the <UNK> who <UNK> me . </S>

I also have some pink lines at this graph diagram going down down and down to the right . </S>
We cherish the golden world . </S>
After all , I &apos;m not a geriatrician . </S>
In other words , it &apos;s a sort of <UNK> program . </S>

When you love your enemy , that means she wants to be happy . </S>
I was swimming around five minutes for five minutes . </S>
&quot; No , no , really , I &apos;m so <UNK> around the stars . </S>
They predicted that someone was on protest where the best of the music was not to be available because the broadcasters had been <UNK> for the <UNK> solution in the management of the <UNK> . </S>
So that &apos;s the project . And this is starting . </S>
It has found a way of dealing with vaccines , and it &apos;s related to them with issues like the cells of the <UNK> . It means that the vaccines don &apos;t have to be <UNK> anymore . </S>
It was my grandfather suffering that had inspired my work in the Women &apos;s health care . </S>
Again , we &apos;re bringing our environment to do all the things for us . </S>
You could jump directly into that . </S>
The scientists who created these sweet little creature have been doing , they eventually have <UNK> and ate them . </S>
Consider the response of individuals with a highly experienced disease and a change of the way that was just a difficult thing to do , suddenly suddenly &apos;s not quite easy . </S>
He &apos;d added an <UNK> material to my <UNK> . </S>
The remains of over six million people who are left here are some of the over 16,000 years old . </S>
That &apos;s why you need people with a long-term vision . </S>
I &apos;m going to do just what I said . </S>
But you &apos;re limited when you can just get up and down . </S>
I worked with <UNK> <UNK> in the lab for the future of the distant future , looking back up for the future in 20 years . </S>
And so now I &apos;m going to talk about four things today . </S>
We &apos;ve got to do that because we have to do this land at a time and enter into play in a higher education range of science and mathematics . </S>
And that &apos;s the part of the radiation that we can see with our eyes . </S>
Very proud of him was very proud of the <UNK> seat that was given to the very simple seat that he had for his <UNK> to his <UNK> and to the very nice <UNK> around the seat . </S>
The message is that seemingly people probably want to eat , maybe a book , a film , but not want to be in their community . </S>
So I proposed the one <UNK> and said , &quot; Well , what about , you know , <UNK> ? </S>
<UNK> are actually tying to <UNK> or <UNK> flesh while we &apos;re talking here . </S>
But that was a great time of the computer that was even more difficult . One kind of <UNK> era . </S>
He <UNK> not that the power of a day would be a <UNK> in military <UNK> , who would come with an army that could address this ? This was from an article in an article that I was reading recently . </S>
&quot; First of all , I became <UNK> for health issues , and then there was a question of morality . </S>
Imagine what a coral is actually like a living creature . </S>
And in the <UNK> career of my calendar year was that one of the most severe <UNK> that he ever did was he said . </S>
Here &apos;s a list of the last year at June last year and what 48 of them are currently doing . </S>
Compare a Ph.D. back in 1900 who had just a few remarks at Camp with a developing country or specialists with an <UNK> , scientific training . </S>
This poem is called &quot; <UNK> <UNK> . &quot; </S>
At that point the woman was alive . </S>
Or whether it just <UNK> them . </S>
It &apos;s an amazing innovation if you think about it . </S>
Elizabeth : Get yourself out ! Get yourself out ! Get out of them ! </S>
Sometimes they carry these cars so that they actually make a small thing . </S>
It &apos;s to be in between the positions between the drug . </S>
We &apos;re in the middle of this process . </S>
SB : Yeah , I think it &apos;s not that it &apos;s right and I think that because animals have shown us . </S>
I was making a social worry about an answer that he thought was not very interesting to do . </S>
They look just every time . </S>
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . </S>
Sorry . </S>
<UNK> began to figure out this thing about consumers found in their consumers . </S>
These are the bone that was removed after the best of the meat after it was . </S>
Instead , it &apos;s in the organization that changes when the colony gets older . </S>
I can take a BMW if I can come to the client . </S>
And a woman who lives in our street lives , a Sekhri . </S>
It makes a living life . </S>
And when the story came , I was sending it to the <UNK> of the <UNK> . </S>
Now we &apos;ve gone through a long direction , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot . </S>
So this thing is in a twist . </S>
They had been involved in people who were <UNK> to report because they were bored . </S>
They can use this information to grasp away as part of a stick . </S>
Curiosity is the cat of death -- they go on a load tank . </S>

My children always tell me that a passion is a little more obvious than the other . </S>
The International Criminal School meeting schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector -- even our competitors , all of us together to celebrate all the major schools in the world . </S>
Nobody else has seen it , but I found it in a book and I have a link to a page that describes it , and I <UNK> it tomorrow , and it won &apos;t erase it . &quot; And then it will live . </S>
Taking up and down . </S>
Because if we can do that , that &apos;s where the relationship of a massive social collapse of the growth of the power is trust and influence . </S>
But first of all , we need to have some knowledge . </S>
When I arrived -- in the next four years , I was home to four different parts of the next two decades . </S>
No special substances in the <UNK> . </S>
When I was a little girl , my grandfather was his little girl friend me . </S>
A little village asked for 600 people to come and get toilets where there weren &apos;t . </S>
There are 15 or 20 <UNK> who are <UNK> to change when you have learned a very simple skill . </S>
Could I go to older and older people who would tell me how to write the things that happen in the world ? </S>
And it was like the old Vegas ever once . </S>
But it &apos;s probably not the <UNK> . </S>
For every single neuron , you can actually have between 10,000 and 100,000 different connections or <UNK> , or whatever you want to call , and every time when you learn something about it or you learn something that you do and you have a learning experience , you get that idea of information . </S>
But this is not just about economic failure . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and Robin <UNK> . </S>

Some of them , who came to the suburbs like about Madison or Wisconsin or at Berkeley cover 20 to about 40,000 hours . </S>
And the second thing is , is it possible to slow down or even more ? </S>
And again , it seems to be irrational . </S>

Here &apos;s the second from the left side with the elders in <UNK> , a small village outside of <UNK> . </S>
You know , come for a choice for a <UNK> life . </S>
This was now -- this was about 10 years ago -- this was 36 years after the <UNK> of the Dalai Lama . </S>
And it &apos;s maybe a surprising thing to happen because my research colleagues at the foundation is about vaccines for vaccines and seeds to make things that have to make and deliver better for the poorest two billion . </S>
Now , these are <UNK> , but I want to tell you about the questions that are much more on empathy and that are really very often the questions that people have waited for their whole life to be asked . </S>
Thank you . </S>
Science and simple observation have to give us this feeling like this , so I don &apos;t feel a need . </S>
Everybody in this room has to do with its own version of the <UNK> . </S>
This is a country that has very , very interesting , very interesting <UNK> . </S>
Then we need programmable parts that can set up with sequence and leverage that sequence and use to <UNK> . </S>
In the hind foot of January , Joe was sitting on the side of my face with empty face on her face . </S>
And that was <UNK> in my life that had really disturbed me , and he led to write a book that had tagged of fish before drowning . </S>
So here &apos;s a series of possibilities : the cycles in a sense of ambiguity , like Robert Wright , he &apos;s &quot; <UNK> . &quot; </S>
But nobody can kill the spirit of the true Mexicans . </S>
I don &apos;t know if someone has a performing 2004 , but they &apos;re fantastic . </S>
Diamonds , you &apos;re good . I &apos;m going to start here . </S>
And the question was , how do you combine technology and new technology ? </S>
I &apos;d like you to design it . &quot; </S>
We &apos;re just right now in the middle of the 60s . </S>
That &apos;s how far we found is that cotton roll roll . </S>
And we said , &quot; He &apos;s just about five years old . &quot; </S>
The voices were <UNK> . </S>
We know we know that we &apos;re going to figure out all of that . </S>
And that &apos;s when the researchers freak out . </S>
<UNK> , for example , how many big economists do I &apos;m a fish . </S>
And as a consequence , we get caught in the fight with the truly difficult question when someone is dead , and that gives us a really difficult position to do not to have very simple categories like the early . </S>
They get an incredible bet , and they better understood the sheer residue of destruction to this place . </S>
So whether we &apos;re talking about liquid grass or foie gras . </S>
Unfortunately , he was born two years ago in 1970 , and that dream was so he could not live anymore . </S>
But when he realized there was something that he saw by her <UNK> <UNK> with countless <UNK> <UNK> , and every telling him to &quot; &apos; &quot; I was first here . </S>
What I love about this is a couple of interesting research papers in design . </S>
Being creative . But we know who &apos;s not ready to make a mistake is not going to make a difference . If you &apos;re not ready to make mistakes , and if they &apos;re only impoverished , most kids have lost that capacity . </S>
Cities gave them the assignment and removed from all animals from the street from the road and to fertilize them . </S>
We looked at the historical study that we had , in spite of the fact that we now have a lot of modern innovations that we have not used to do -- we have the good <UNK> , and we &apos;ve got the <UNK> the information you &apos;ve got to do in the cockpit , but we realized that if we didn &apos;t get the results from the situation that we have learned in the past hundred years , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned in the last hundred years . </S>
It &apos;s in for learning and memory . </S>
The teenagers said , they could see very well . </S>
As I said , we were at the beginning of the <UNK> . </S>
The ten seconds is actually going to happen because we don &apos;t -- I don &apos;t know whether they &apos;ve ever been thinking about this before they &apos;ve spent a television just with a wire . </S>
Bring me to laughter . <UNK> my interest . </S>
The police district was <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
He had a driver , and he was going to a driver and after the Senate was able to take his hand off his hand and put them back on the position of the judge while the car was going on , just like the kid described it , right ? </S>
He feels hot , cold , silly , <UNK> , everything from his missing hand in both of his hand and his hand and his chest and he can play both . </S>
DR : Yeah . They had to figure out a way to do that -- we had to work with the families of the victims and work with the city to make sure they were informed . </S>
And that sadness actually <UNK> itself in a thought that I was longing for myself . </S>
You know , look at the propaganda . </S>
What we found was the best image we had ever had , like , something like that . </S>
We need to help to get them from poverty . </S>
Every day come back to me and say , &quot; I wish I had a interview with my father or father or father , but I was just waiting too long . </S>
James wanted to do <UNK> as a <UNK> , and I came up with the vehicles that used to use those <UNK> to put things out of place on the street in the street . </S>

About seven years ago , they were on the brink of last year , because they quit Israel to build a bicycle site and built a part of that border across the village . </S>
We &apos;re going to change the direction . </S>
So when you try to understand what the doctor is doing , we do have a surgeon deciding how to do it in your body . It &apos;s already gone . </S>
That offers us the scientific . It offers us the opportunity to break down the uncertainty of it by playing . </S>
The cybercriminals I was talking about were , while they stole millions of dollars and still not arrested , and it &apos;s good possible for that that &apos;s never going to happen at that point . </S>
I never met anyone who says , &quot; I don &apos;t like flowers . &quot; </S>
Everything came out with one of my colleagues , who asked me to study a series of brains that were female share a psychopathic <UNK> . </S>
And he made me realize like the molecular world in us . </S>
I mean , it &apos;s a great design . </S>
I was <UNK> . I went when my legs were out of wood . </S>
We are simply not just helpless and victims of the <UNK> . </S>
And the mystery existed for a gentleman called <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
All that &apos;s done by one thing is a number one up or down , and a red button at the stop ! </S>
And all kinds of benefit . </S>
These older people come to me and say , &quot; <UNK> , ladies , talk , you &apos;re lectures . They say to tell people that they should stop saying that in the history of our nation &apos; history is to do with terrorism . </S>
So a few . </S>
You know better than everybody else that HIV is getting the best and worst in the people . </S>
Let &apos;s call her the <UNK> . </S>
Now I &apos;m going to summarize a project for a whole year at two subjects , and we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do all that &apos;s caused by all of these things . </S>
And we bring them into shells that we call <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
Sorry . </S>
We like that and in and out of life . </S>
<UNK> : it would be one of the symmetries of that E8 structure . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> : This is one of the most famous <UNK> ads of the last year , known as &quot; the visible version of <UNK> , &quot; public for <UNK> ... ... for the <UNK> gesture . </S>
We measured a lot of progress . </S>
4 is 4 . </S>

One of the reasons why a leader came up with my will , the doctors said , &quot; I &apos;m officially officially <UNK> . &quot; </S>
These are four of the talks that many of them are in discipline within their discipline . </S>
And even more shocking : After a third rate of <UNK> , 70 percent of the teenagers have spent time in care . </S>
And two weeks after I was done it , we had to <UNK> our first <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> , which is my <UNK> fear . </S>
And it changed because there was a huge shift in the authority of the information side from the authority side . </S>
I &apos;m just going to share both of them and show up the way they &apos;re communicating to each other , and there &apos;s a good news for the end . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> really do what they like . </S>
And that &apos;s the <UNK> , the hacker . </S>
&quot; Even if I was hungry , I wouldn &apos;t eat my <UNK> if they &apos;d been trained to a very thoroughly <UNK> . &quot; </S>
I don &apos;t need a word like that . &quot; </S>
A couple of years ago I decided to write my experiences and my own journey , and I &apos;m here to tell you a little bit about that today , to say , to be kind of a <UNK> . </S>
After a few years at MIT , I realized -- well , you know , writing about scientific paper isn &apos;t how exciting . </S>
We developed a simple strategy and they gave it to a public meeting . </S>
The <UNK> in the food that feeds to women will enter into the house that is just being recorded by the fetus . </S>
And we believe that people aren &apos;t probably supposed to be true for people who are not going to look and Barack Obama . </S>
We have to take a special account for the fact that our actions can prevent them from some sort of <UNK> <UNK> their unethical activities . </S>
she said , &quot; Come on my <UNK> apartment . &quot; </S>
And he said , &quot; We &apos;re not seen a live witness by some <UNK> in virtual worlds and <UNK> . &quot; </S>
So this is sort of a sea sponge that works in its ecosystem . </S>
And the first thing is just a common scientific paper that has shown the evidence , &quot; <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> Bill Islands in <UNK> , indicates that there was an asteroid that had a dinosaur . &quot; </S>
We got focused on the depression at that time , and there are so many treatments for it : drugs , <UNK> and even <UNK> . But there are millions of people and there are still 10 or 20 percent patients who don &apos;t really care about who they don &apos;t want and help . </S>
It turns out that in the earliest days , they were a little childhood and a lot of men who prefer the society of men -- physical society . </S>
So here he is walking the sun . </S>
And he said , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot; </S>
And again , you get the repetition and personal information . </S>
You know , blogs are scary . You see something like this . </S>
I had just done the <UNK> <UNK> and had a guy who had just kept behind me and said , &quot; How do you do that ? You know , we should actually perform in a flat foot , you wouldn &apos;t come from a springboard . &quot; </S>
OK , open your eyes . </S>
So our engineers and the architects don &apos;t care about at the depths of the minimum at <UNK> right now because they &apos;re very interested in the very precisely for it . </S>
Some people who could participate in our campaign might just give an hour of an <UNK> month . </S>
For example , in Chad . Sweeney : <UNK> . </S>
They &apos;re totally flat , essentially <UNK> characters . </S>
And on the right side , we &apos;re showing the same data , but here is in the equivalent of the cases . </S>
I have the nose full of <UNK> , rich , <UNK> countries . </S>
Row to 40 meters , of course , are <UNK> , dome and <UNK> . </S>
I <UNK> . </S>
But , you know , I have a problem with <UNK> : I think it &apos;s full of propaganda . </S>
And he was coming back and he said something to him and he realized he was deaf , and we had <UNK> in the <UNK> and there were two eyes . </S>
You were giving instruction to the top . </S>
So here &apos;s an example of how we did the study . </S>
The fibers that can make a single spider is a bit of a lot . </S>
So it &apos;s on that they have to make these smart practice in the service of other people &apos;s decisions and not for themselves . </S>
And congratulations , that you &apos;re now lied to your great globally . </S>
Or are <UNK> here ? They have an <UNK> to come as an inspiration . </S>
Tell it very quietly for yourself or say it . </S>
We call this work &quot; The <UNK> . &quot; </S>
Now , could you explain to give you an <UNK> understanding , how could possibly change the success work ? </S>
And venture could use that data . </S>
While you &apos;re sitting in this room , you can pull it down to 60 meters or down to two meters . They &apos;re going to end with a few simple , simple attitude . </S>
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; </S>
And although they had been <UNK> and the game couldn &apos;t have , and the game had never played before , &quot; the <UNK> &quot; because of the nature that didn &apos;t know because the average proposal was a little bit close to 50 / 50 . </S>
And I said , &quot; Dad , your dad is a very big journalist journalist like what was going to be like . &quot; </S>
The schools do you . The teachers will take you . </S>
Dr. <UNK> <UNK> and her team of New Zealand tested an old tradition of her city . </S>
Thank you . </S>
I needed to have a way to share that experience directly . </S>
So that &apos;s an accurate example of the <UNK> in our galaxy , just in our galaxy , by the way , and I still remember the <UNK> of that is that our galaxy is one of 100 billion . </S>
How would we have ? </S>
These two groups are not talking . </S>
Research in Tokyo used to use it as a potential controller against TV . </S>
This raises a bunch of issues for soldiers in those situations because they do work that they didn &apos;t have trained for them to do , and they do the kinds of things that people do in the math would be very educated and engaged in the <UNK> . </S>
Even in the U.S. is impossible to make the connectivity that are the connectivity that we want . </S>
These are two of my favorites : The <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
Now , you could ask : what about these <UNK> ? </S>
The most fundamental answer is that it &apos;s just become better in a few countries . </S>
At another one of the <UNK> , I was speaking to the road in the machine to come to the director . </S>
So today , I &apos;m going to tell you about a few people who &apos;ve never taken away from their home . </S>
Well , it could not be more wrong . </S>
It makes a lot of mistakes . </S>
Unfortunately , that &apos;s what we do . </S>
This is Mahler <UNK> . </S>
This rain is extremely difficult for ourselves to just discovered a few trees that had never seen before in the summertime of 2006 -- <UNK> , the largest tree in 2006 . </S>
She had come through her experience with her experience , but she wouldn &apos;t just let her <UNK> me just die . </S>
The original idea was not mine , but it was like the athlete I &apos;m just going to make a sequel . </S>
And that &apos;s kind of a bit of a challenge and skills to be able to distinguish from person to person . </S>
Death Valley is the most beautiful , middle place in the United States . There &apos;s nothing growing . </S>
As you can see on the <UNK> scans , we can restore it . </S>
But the interesting thing about this computer was that if you just looked at the height of the infections that happened through the thousands of times , they had to indicate that they were known by a syndrome called flu viruses . </S>
The effect of course is natural . But when the wind itself down at the end of the wind . </S>
Their humanity seems never seems to matter . </S>
She had a little fire to stay at the end of the road . </S>
<UNK> and <UNK> are leaving almost every day chasing the forest in this community . </S>
This is the Korean Institute for highly scientific science and technology . </S>
The roles of our children have changed . </S>
So these kinds of decisions you should be wondering about . </S>
I &apos;m supposed to suggest that the <UNK> , about 19 percent of the matter that they added for Democrats as well as a Republican cover : <UNK> , <UNK> , other programs that do well in Democrats . </S>
I &apos;m thinking that would make my heartbeat be inappropriate . </S>
The perfect front song -- according to the perfect chain with the perfect sign . </S>
Now , let me tell you about the next things we do . </S>
And by being able to explain this idea in a minute , I &apos;m going to tell you three stories about using it for time . </S>
They &apos;d been compared to animals . </S>
Humanity has suffered from thousands of thousands of pain from pain pain to pain , <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> , and when the metastases hit the bone cells sometimes they feel extremely painful . </S>
When you do that , what we &apos;ve been talking about , you &apos;re paying attention to what people are actually talking about in your tribes . </S>
The link that I clicked on here is &quot; Magic Magic &quot; of the Magic I clicked on underwater because I understood the two words . </S>
Everybody knew their genius was slightly paralyzed . </S>
Just to give you a little game here I am made a little game . </S>
Like his eyes were <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
People were very upset . It was taken from the Nobel Prize , and Alice had really had to try to find all the cases of cancer in kids who could find them before they were going to study before they disappear . </S>
But it was also a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- and I was finally able to start with the project . </S>
<UNK> years later , he was dressed as a <UNK> and brought it back to the back of the country when we first discovered there was plans to get him to kill him . </S>
Traditional ancestors on planet Earth , if you survive the <UNK> , only for average a million years . </S>
In fact , in the upper field , you can see the blue fields that are using less glucose to normal , particularly here in the <UNK> . </S>
Outside of the east there is a lot of room and lots of <UNK> and not very many people . So you can get a lot of stuff out there . </S>
It will help us to address our workplaces and a life full of happiness and happiness and happiness and health , but in the past have time to happen in technology just an information technology . </S>
And we take that one for granted , and <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
So we began with a motor with a little lever and smaller design . </S>
No operators in the <UNK> . </S>
At the end of the day and <UNK> , she took off an <UNK> , and at August at 25 of that it was a polio virus like a virus . </S>
Thank you . </S>
But to meet that virus , you should run science and try to understand anything neutral , how and why it spreads . </S>
And so I spent about two years in Agumbe and looking at these two things , and it was a special time in my life . </S>
I &apos;m going to talk about our personal behavior in donations , charity and the tourism for our greatest concerns in our dreams , and our deep wish to change the world . </S>
This isn &apos;t logical . Once you think that we want extinct species to live back to an African and an Asian and an Asian elephant . </S>
But you know that your senses aren &apos;t perfect , and therefore you can &apos;t predict exactly where it will happen by the red cloud that represents the numbers between death and the Middle Ages . </S>
There are some themes from the explorers , but they &apos;re <UNK> and it &apos;s designed for you . OK ? </S>
He invited all his surprise : to come up with his daughter and his daughter . </S>
And if it feels that you &apos;re talking about it , you &apos;re talking about it that sounds different from the sounds that it senses around . </S>
I &apos;d like to put them on television in the context , in the Internet . </S>
This is Ken at the very back of the right-hand side that was one of three to a three of you who was losing Harvard &apos;s &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; <UNK> supercomputer of IBM . </S>
Why don &apos;t we all think of a little bit more like the moon ? </S>
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; No , you know , it &apos;s a appreciation of female material to build <UNK> , and is a result of the fact that , &quot; and you can say that that &apos;s a <UNK> psychological emotion . </S>
In a program called <UNK> , we &apos;ve traveled from Ireland to Canada and from <UNK> to Spain . </S>
These are the blue bars . </S>
It shows you that our governments , open up vertically , built for the economic model of industrial revolution -- vertical soil , specialization from tasks that have complete false structure . </S>
When I was a little kid , I was often in the North of Michigan and <UNK> in the waters , including <UNK> <UNK> and from whom he was later . </S>
But nobody is better at making us move from your service there , wherever it doesn &apos;t exist as Ushahidi . </S>
I didn &apos;t hear more of the stories like I had done it until then . </S>
This is a field at about 35 meters in diameter , about the size of it which had to hit for about four or a half inches of cholera , or 2,000 years ago . </S>
Let &apos;s not forget that there &apos;s a lot of effort to do this to build all of the things that we tried in Nigeria who was introduced to be an <UNK> . </S>
But this idea of <UNK> is really interesting . </S>
Very good tied along , 800 years ago , from Europe . </S>
A day , a whole day with electricity , at least , puts a lot of carbon dioxide from a sort of marine biodiversity . </S>
It &apos;s like the White House that had had sheep against the house to do the cost for The World War , which is probably not a bad idea . It wouldn &apos;t be a bad idea . </S>
Alex : Hi , I am Alex . I want to say that I am the greatest fan of the global commodity . </S>
JE : Thank God . </S>
Not long after that was invented the alphabet . </S>
It &apos;s not just about taking a pill and your achievements and their pain gets better . </S>
And what I &apos;m excited now is that in the combination of <UNK> technology -- of course , biomimicry and <UNK> of the understanding of our shared humanity comes closer . </S>
What we wanted to do was to help people to help medicine instead of trying to figure out what their usual was doing , at the end of the game . </S>
In the five years of life , the consequences of many different parts came from many different neuroscience , plasticity and learning in the brain until , into clinical hypotheses like the <UNK> <UNK> for autism development : Education <UNK> for students in the <UNK> and <UNK> , and most of the <UNK> in <UNK> . </S>
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot; </S>
You have to be <UNK> . </S>
In fact , the <UNK> here , without those machines are quite low , Chris . </S>
And there is no matter of the fact that the answer to that are probably what &apos;s very likely to be . </S>
We were thrilled to be able to demonstrate . </S>
So I &apos;m actually a modern woman now . </S>
I thought about it all the time . </S>
They send a command out and they get an infinite feedback feedback , and that information comes from the physics to your body and your oxygen footprint . </S>
So by using these devices with lots of different layers of sensors , which I &apos;m just going to show , we just eventually <UNK> it to the brain that had allowed that muscle &apos;s secure will ever be done anywhere -- anywhere else -- anywhere else -- next space , or the next space , or the other side of the planet . </S>
We &apos;ve been an <UNK> increase in millennia for millennia , and I don &apos;t know why someone in the Stone was going to do a <UNK> in his hand , or out of a tube in a tube , I can easily imagine how they did it . </S>
And so that &apos;s the reason for this project . </S>
Because it makes a lot of sense like everything else that I &apos;ve heard about when it came to explain the absolute false sophistication of the creative process . </S>
And eventually I ended up in a school where there was a blend . </S>
Thank you . God bless you and you have a nice day . I &apos;m Steve <UNK> . </S>
She studied my healthcare like me . </S>
So we &apos;re getting more and more tensions . </S>
We had just played the school for weeks after weeks , about seven weeks . And we &apos;d essentially escaped all 50 levels of wild crises . </S>
I saw like they were looking out of a village called the <UNK> in <UNK> of England with a village in Tamil <UNK> in a nearby South India , almost hundreds of thousands of years ago . </S>
&quot; Here &apos;s what it says . &quot; he said . </S>
The <UNK> is in absolutely transformative change . </S>
It enhances your empathy . </S>
All of that data is meant and you should do it one time and it &apos;s all something that should happen . </S>
<UNK> , because you need salt to make yourself working . </S>
As you know , sunflowers in the course of the day of the sun . </S>
And they said , &quot; These children are <UNK> . &quot; </S>
In the year , when Larry Page and Sergey -- I &apos;m giving them a kind of affection and a new connection to them -- in their <UNK> , two million people died of smallpox . </S>
And yet they have three little babies in their bag . </S>
The thing is , if they &apos;re not harmful to them , they cannot be <UNK> . </S>
Nigeria was reaching around 1960 . </S>
There are some spectacular things . </S>
We &apos;re going to have made a dent in <UNK> for China . </S>
In <UNK> they call them &quot; <UNK> , &quot; in New Jersey &quot; <UNK> &quot; : &quot; <UNK> . &quot; </S>
When I made my <UNK> , I said , &quot; The <UNK> One , &quot; like , &quot; <UNK> One , &quot; like I have to impress . </S>
I &apos;m confident that there is such a solution . </S>
Finally , you go to the emergency room and you are waiting for him . </S>
The next thing I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to be a <UNK> mile more than three million <UNK> , and I just spent three hundred and more and more than just New York just on the ocean . &quot; </S>
This is a perfect photograph that made nature . </S>
So we spoke with a few minutes and he said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you tell them about what you do , &quot; what are you thinking ? &quot; </S>
At the time of my birth , black holes didn &apos;t have any <UNK> and that had changed in 1973 . </S>
So you have to get to get your work done a deadline , right ? </S>
&quot; Ma &apos;am , I just miss everything about that war . &quot; </S>
At the time , the doctors were declared to the men &apos;s <UNK> how important it was to satisfy her women . </S>
I am not attracted by their politics but by their life of life . </S>
So our DNA presents in the capacity of this kind of thing . </S>
This was just happened . He &apos;s a <UNK> <UNK> little boy , and that &apos;s his mother . In other situations it wouldn &apos;t be that very well . </S>
These are <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
But we have to engage people with me because it &apos;s about education . </S>
Yeah . The most perfect idea of all . </S>
What was unexpected is that it was creating an <UNK> representation of the brain , while people was enjoying the wine , and not only that they said that they were enjoying the most expensive wine grapes -- their brain actually made a stronger sense of the book that was done in a matter of the same <UNK> . </S>
And now it is 14 of the diseases that are treatable , two of them are actually <UNK> . </S>
A lot of people are afraid of spiders . </S>
That was the age of an age , a time where everything had to be done locally . </S>
One of the biggest victims of this situation was of the river <UNK> that had actually completed the medina for several centuries and many of them have been seen by the flow than the real soul of the city . </S>
Oops . </S>
But unfortunately , people do want me to have a whole time hanging up with a <UNK> if it &apos;s a beauty . </S>
All of the stereotypes that the <UNK> regime wanted us to act by using something called the <UNK> , or the media that was known as wrong . </S>
Being a different is an art form . </S>
These are the latest news from the city . Here is now in perspective . </S>
Natural polymers , I think that &apos;s what it is most beautiful because it has been tried and tested in our environment since we &apos;ve been tested and tested for millions of years . </S>
Never before have so many design meetings so many ways to link us to others at other levels of thinking . </S>
Certainly , 10,000 years ago in the beginning of civilization , time one person was less than a tenth of the average person . </S>
And that &apos;s shown in balconies like a sequence . </S>
People like this . </S>
They enrich other people aren &apos;t from <UNK> , but by the way of picking yourself . </S>
And the other half of the people ? </S>
We struggled together , we lived together . </S>
But in a lot of cases , we have with Wolfram Alpha at the beginning . </S>
Even if you know that everybody is going to change the colors , once you do it . You have to focus . You have to focus on some sort of thing to look at some of the changes . </S>
Of course , the kind of events that shows us about American media and forgive me , but in numbers it &apos;s very tiny accidents . </S>
Now here &apos;s another example , which is -- it &apos;s a little <UNK> . </S>
So we made this series with about Two and white portraits in T-shirts . </S>
They say , &quot; How &apos;s that possible ? &quot; </S>
And if you think of the environment in that tsunami , they basically picked up an entire army of <UNK> a tremendous amount of material to tell their stories . </S>
This is glamour : The <UNK> is &quot; <UNK> , &quot; of the Maria <UNK> old and her oh old are like Jesus and she both become happy and pleasant . </S>
By 1900 , three percent of the Americans who were jobs were challenging to be challenging . </S>
We need a film about this six categories . </S>
But because it &apos;s possible for the same time and space everywhere around the world -- and because of my interest in my view it &apos;s a <UNK> , and somewhere between reality and virtuality and virtuality , it seemed to make sense in a way to think about it in a hologram . </S>
She has taught us about <UNK> . </S>
It &apos;s above all about selective tracking things that are important for the brain . </S>
That &apos;s what they do for two reasons . </S>
Thank you . </S>
I have to have <UNK> , or sometimes I &apos;m shouting sometimes . </S>
What a curiosity that made me think about what happens next ? </S>
Perhaps an interesting thing has been that primary innovation for the first time also , the <UNK> of the Big Bang . </S>
I met these guys . </S>
Then we wanted to look at other ways of crossing the land by growing food and the <UNK> for a much develop for a lot of time looking for <UNK> , through the use of <UNK> and <UNK> , the institutions in the neighborhood <UNK> , and actually helped <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
And it &apos;s just anagnorisis and peripeteia . </S>
<UNK> is a lot of <UNK> . It &apos;s more like <UNK> . </S>
He took his pen and he moves him to the heart and he placed him to the heart and he could feel the heart of the living patient . </S>
So we went to Cambridge University who was talking to other University and spoke with a physicist and Ph.D. &apos; Choice that taught us that we were at 60 miles an hour . </S>
They &apos;re part of the truths that the two has . </S>
It &apos;s about letting it happen . </S>
I worked really hard at an abundance of labor like cattle in <UNK> . </S>
Darling , <UNK> you see you see you . &quot; </S>
You can see , about the <UNK> of <UNK> , and you can only see where these regions are true and what don &apos;t happen if people think things . </S>
She said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; </S>
So , inside of all , we &apos;ve come across a border . </S>
Now in a digital age , we can take things together with different kinds of things and make much easier if we manage these values , how much of us could make much easier for us to do things and make much easier for us . </S>
He didn &apos;t have given up , and if he didn &apos;t have given up how he could possibly have been out there in the mind ever to lose hope ? </S>
Now , talk about sex . </S>
In four years later , the answer to the <UNK> is to make sure that all of these have access to this piece of soap that they have in this piece , and they &apos;re using it because this is the best way to prevent the spread of cholera . </S>
You don &apos;t do anything about it . </S>
It &apos;s coming back , that &apos;s great . </S>
It should not be like this , right ? </S>
The laws of media , like the fact that it doesn &apos;t have any value . </S>
The following episode happened in seven weeks of my first year at Yale Law School . </S>
But it &apos;s not a normal movie . </S>
The pyramids , the <UNK> , the New Yorker <UNK> , <UNK> , ancient and modern wonders of people &apos;s alive . </S>
First of all , the absolute premise that there was something like &quot; full scientific insight . </S>
And that &apos;s the thing to do . </S>
So there were two cars each of which had two cars with each other . </S>
Thank you . </S>
You know , it &apos;s kind of bad -- Sorry , <UNK> , <UNK> . </S>
We think that corn has a ground in Mexico . </S>
They sent him to Broadmoor . </S>
As you can see , Bruce <UNK> had a lot of hair back at that time . </S>
That is , we have local access to the private sector within the <UNK> , but we have to make that increase , their capacity , like in the Southern ocean , where it gives an <UNK> organization for <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
And that tells us a lot of things . </S>
That &apos;s the current business . </S>
They wrote back at me . &quot; That &apos;s what we call a <UNK> . &quot; </S>
When people are actually familiar with bioluminescence , with these guys here , fireflies . </S>
And I think that they have some of the talk that they have to . </S>
Most of us were not only made pictures of nuclear disasters , but with pictures and knowledge to the Holocaust . </S>
We &apos;ve pioneered more studies for lung cancer , pancreatic cancer and a half million . </S>
He said , &quot; You have taught me too far . </S>
But for us than the movement that depends on taking their bank account that has to move from their <UNK> to grow from their <UNK> , makes the issue that our successes are as important as the result of how to reduce the risk of growth and affect the economy into their own . </S>
It &apos;s not that important . &quot; </S>
The book itself is a polymer . It &apos;s 24,000 tree . </S>
In America , the Somali story is an eighth degree , and you get its <UNK> . And you can go up to the law level . </S>
And that psychological <UNK> had made for many years , and now the Internet comes from technology , technology , SMS . </S>
These are just a few guys who admire the car . </S>
I was like , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; </S>
He bleeds a <UNK> . </S>
I &apos;m going to say why psychology was good for why they &apos;re not very good and how they might be good at the next 10 years . </S>
So they play with fire . </S>
And just like you use remote control to change the attitudes of your species and change how you particularly like it right now to use your language to change the attitudes in the brain of another way of thinking about your skills . </S>
This is an <UNK> from the <UNK> Campaign . </S>
So the first thing you end up , number three , is not centered on your belly , like by freestyle by freestyle to what a lot of people think up on top of the water . </S>
Now I &apos;ve got half the total audiences . </S>
I came from that very far to meet here . </S>
And it was a fish . </S>
In other words , people could do this . <UNK> blood cells , make a difference . </S>
You could play it on top of it . You could play around it with a couple of stones . You could play it in little bits and they wouldn &apos;t fit through any <UNK> of the <UNK> , because the Walker hit the wall . Think of the conditioning and your cable . </S>
At some point . I &apos;m really thinking , you know , people are amazing and clever , and they &apos;re interested . </S>
Because he was afraid of that I was walking around for a shoot right there . </S>
And I &apos;m just going to show you one last demonstration , but first of that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to say to me and say , &quot; Any little . &quot; </S>
The child who represent that nation or religion has been <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
I know theater can improve the quality of life of people , and I know that theater can be healing . </S>
Because you cannot sell your word anymore . </S>
Here &apos;s an article article in 2009 who <UNK> our work , and another one at Time . </S>
You know , dolphins are a species that are probably similar to a lot of ways that we do , even though we can &apos;t tell that to that , but they live in a so different environment that we need to bridge this distance with sensory systems . </S>
So , it &apos;s much more effective if you get insects to make your own work done . </S>
We &apos;re putting in large areas of areas that are particularly relevant for Africa &apos;s development because scientists in Africa who are working in those fields are competitive . </S>
You have a food . A lunch guy -- a <UNK> -- and 16 people have in the conventional apartment room . Or a <UNK> . </S>
But first of all , I &apos;d like you to think about this graph . </S>
They talk English , they are a language with a very language language . </S>
Lying is complex . </S>
I can only do <UNK> Barbie Gates &apos; last TED ever . </S>
In Miami , three of the over five people die from an intensive care unit . </S>
At the end of that I &apos;m going to end with a story . </S>
I grew up in downtown Manhattan in the early &apos; 80s , two blocks from the <UNK> of the <UNK> . </S>
You can see the change in the use of recycled materials . </S>
The slow speed of technological changes in traditional societies is the other thing that someone is learning as a kid . </S>
You have to band together a group . </S>
I invented a pottery set to run at any <UNK> corridors . </S>
And when one of the first things you have to do is take a look at the One one and then at the monitor , what seems to be <UNK> by itself , because they wanted to adjust the form of the previous technology as a content for the new technology . </S>
He looked at me and said , &quot; <UNK> , you don &apos;t understand , these people are <UNK> . </S>
How do you feed the world ? &quot; </S>
So we sit and thinking about why men with a mutation bug in the <UNK> , prostate cancer ? </S>
And it &apos;s the same thing if you try to figure out the questions of things . </S>
An education tool , similar to how the brain research explored the complexity of the body , exploring complexity of the human mind . </S>
<UNK> are wonderfully on roofs . </S>
At first I thought it was a good thing to do , you know , we need an <UNK> , and we &apos;re not like the <UNK> ; let us as a -- I &apos;m leaving all of that training . </S>
But in some other aspects of the structure of social networks , it &apos;s not so obvious . </S>
Great kids love strawberries and bananas . </S>
Let &apos;s go back to the question of cooking and return . </S>
I wanted to create places that had given the same emotion that you had in the <UNK> Park . I didn &apos;t want to make sure that there were <UNK> <UNK> places like this built . </S>
This is Mahler who came to us and reached us of his bears . </S>
Thank you . Thanks . </S>
Made of 2010 . </S>
And I was actually a scaled up here very very very very proud image to see a <UNK> . </S>
So what did we learn from all this ? </S>
One in 200 million hits , are 60 percent young people . </S>
You can begin to think about solutions to this problem , even if that &apos;s the problem protected aggressive and rugged like racism . </S>
If you &apos;re sitting here today in an audience today or maybe you can see this presentation at some moment , <UNK> , they &apos;re a participant in the digital <UNK> program . </S>
Here are photographs of me . </S>
What do you think about when you have a word &quot; <UNK> or <UNK> ? &quot; </S>
About 10 years of internal tension in the tests to develop everything that we think it &apos;s okay . </S>
But just to give you a better life for yourself . </S>
Secondly , that concept . </S>
Think of things like mountain climbing and casting . </S>
And I <UNK> the stairs up and grabbed my suitcase . </S>
We &apos;ve got to select that direction . </S>
They said they had the electronic version of their cousins in their cousin . </S>
Thank you . </S>
I was too young , because not children , had not really known to Africa and was pretty awful . </S>
A few people think that the model of the model is very beautiful and good , but they &apos;re asking , &quot; Well , are they really as good as the rat ? &quot; </S>
And we &apos;re going to think about it if we think about this as a bigger picture of the world . </S>
If you can hear music you should know about it . </S>
Three quarters of the electricity we feed for electricity . </S>
We moved to the sea . We numb the solar panels of our planet , and we &apos;re growing hundreds of millions of animals whose lives are at <UNK> . </S>
As average <UNK> lie lie to your set up your partner once every 10 interactions . </S>
I feel so happy . </S>
Now he &apos;s selling it on Walmart . </S>
Every time we followed it , we asked them to try and answer several questions -- &quot; on a scale of one to seven , how happy are you at the moment ? </S>
It was a glory . Thank you very much , Murray Murray . </S>
What happened over here ? </S>
Then there &apos;s a second test , you tell you , you &apos;re HIV . They &apos;re shocked . </S>
This is with 16 , here from the far left . </S>
And it isn &apos;t just for <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , that &apos;s for every drug supply for the public or a drug supply . </S>
No one chance . We &apos;re different . &quot; </S>
You get a very large eye in the middle , looking down . </S>
One is the process of the <UNK> . </S>
We asked a half , &quot; What do you think it has changed in 10 years ? &quot; </S>
Fox Fox : two . Moving two : two . C zero . </S>
You know what it means . They &apos;re very intelligent listeners , do you ? Let &apos;s take 100 percent statistics . You can &apos;t do it like that . You can &apos;t do it anymore . How do you learn about it ? We do it again . Don &apos;t do anything . </S>
This is only to be found out when you look at a step down and look at the whole thing . </S>
You don &apos;t need -- you don &apos;t need something more to get something done . </S>
All right . They look like <UNK> . </S>
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony that came from Harvard University and said , &quot; I said , &quot; I chose one woman &apos;s first chosen . &quot; </S>
So , 16 miles , for eight kilometers -- that &apos;s about the <UNK> of <UNK> . </S>
These guys , like the things that look like <UNK> , and they come from both sides , they make a dynamic activation of a cell . </S>
In many ways , he &apos;s the <UNK> , because over 200 years , the West was so <UNK> around the world that it was not necessary to understand other cultures , other civilizations . </S>
<UNK> . </S>
And indeed , he took advantage of the <UNK> . </S>
Most scientists are more boring . </S>
You just look at it in a very rapid scale , you can see a lot of different microbial colonies . </S>
Now , at 4 of September , there was a big <UNK> , which is what you do on polio . </S>
Now we have about two thirds of the story behind us . </S>
And I &apos;m saying this <UNK> , because we &apos;d have to say that at some level of normal psychology to say that this piece is a piece of music , but I do just imagine making it in the room to do it just for the moment in your brains because we will return to that question . </S>
People seem to love it . </S>
One tree he saw a woman in deep <UNK> in her baby . </S>
This <UNK> here , that five of them were together for 97 years . </S>
He said , &quot; We have a community that owns its own business . &quot; </S>
The best early press that we had , the best , the best , the best architect . </S>
Thank you . </S>
For me , they &apos;re just as successful as Lewis <UNK> or Bill <UNK> , or many of the other really skilled players who we had . </S>
We &apos;ve got to do the economic model so that all the peoples and all the nations result that are the right result -- the <UNK> and the <UNK> outcome . </S>
<UNK> , here &apos;s <UNK> , it &apos;s nanotechnology . </S>
<UNK> . No copyright . </S>
Now , back to the simplicity . </S>
Anyway , I like myself , I like a friend it is like a friend . I like the person <UNK> body weight : &quot; I like the kind of television you have changed , I kind of like reading the &quot; my two weeks is what I call the <UNK> . &quot; That &apos;s the moment when I &apos;m leaving . &quot; </S>
Yeah , I &apos;m sure . </S>
And that &apos;s something that we don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible . </S>
We don &apos;t know what we say . </S>
PM : Yeah , Milo will leave you from his parents , which is time for us to be alone and himself . </S>
All of that is possibilities . </S>
This is all digital . </S>
Cancer , cancer , Parkinson &apos;s disease , Alzheimer &apos;s heart disease , porn . We &apos;re known it as a deadly disease that you can do relatively little . </S>
And of course our chromosomes and our government . </S>
Now we &apos;re going to be able to do that in the same time with daylight . </S>
You can look at more pictures . </S>
Where &apos;s it inside the neocortex ? </S>
It would be absurd to speak about the people that neither their food nor wasn &apos;t food or shelter and structured . </S>
Let &apos;s zoom back from that , the same high school includes the high school of &#91; unclear &#93; in Kansas City , Missouri serves to the army giving him a rifle , they send him to Iraq . </S>
I think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a professional purpose we have , but the words are particularly meaningful in a committed desire for a committed teacher . </S>
At the other hand , this animal has unique <UNK> ; the research on this mammal can give us insight into human insight , such as such as blindness blindness and <UNK> . </S>
And three , now there is permanently <UNK> . </S>
And by the time it has been around for hundreds of years since his , like I have to say , very successful introduction . </S>
So the things that make a visual realistic look like , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about the things around us in our daily lives . </S>
We can begin by taking farmers to the <UNK> like Eduardo . </S>
When I &apos;m outside in the factory or there are problems in the factory , apparently they may not be able to tell if they have a <UNK> . </S>
That means &quot; <UNK> back and get a better look . &quot; Learn from the past . </S>
More crime . We look at it all , we think , <UNK> , the things . </S>
Now who would be <UNK> as just as pure policing in the human mind ? </S>
But I learned that two very , very important lessons there on Mt . Everest . And I thank my team of <UNK> who taught me . </S>
Another one is the frontal lobe , which is controlling how we sustain attention and a half part is the fusiform gyrus that controls how we control and measure things and regulate and <UNK> . </S>
We &apos;re facing ourselves . </S>
But when I hold another lecture to the student students , saying to me , &quot; No , there can &apos;t have all around the world and washing machines . &quot; </S>
But <UNK> -- if a person <UNK> a <UNK> , and another one of them is another -- could be uncomfortable . </S>
The <UNK> would be to focus on the <UNK> . </S>
But when we ran to sustainable investment in this case , nobody was interested . </S>
You can make societal diversity of the same highly effective scientific models that we use for drugs . </S>
We &apos;ve talked about &#91; ... &#93; and we &apos;ve been talking about all of these things . </S>
And then when it comes to the cabin in front of the stream , while the plane was coming back down , whatever was for an <UNK> would do all the time . </S>
But by doing that by looking at the smell of control and in the lab , it &apos;s a great pleasure and very interesting and very exciting and exciting with <UNK> and graduate images and have to come up with the face of the smell and the <UNK> is kind of into the mind . </S>
It &apos;s enough for 6,000 liters . </S>
Just to give you an idea . </S>
Now , accidents from the last time &quot; -- the whole data set from about 30 years of data -- &quot; you don &apos;t see it . You don &apos;t see it . The new car seats are much better off . &quot; </S>
DH : The French judge presents an <UNK> . </S>
My colleagues at NASA runs <UNK> Laboratory in Princeton and I work on a technology that is going to happen in a number of years . </S>
These <UNK> are required problems that they call the White House they call &quot; the <UNK> successes . &quot; </S>
The government can pay attention to the risks , the end of that envelope . </S>
I then come up with a cocktail on the other thing : say , &quot; Hey , there &apos;s a lot of coins from the front of the front of the local trials on the ground . &quot; </S>
We called it the theory of the two and two <UNK> . </S>
Then we begin to add better to the top of the muscle . </S>
It felt like it was weird . </S>
That &apos;s the responsibility of the architect . </S>
He shook his head , no . </S>
And we built a model of the <UNK> without bone . </S>
They &apos;re both connected because it takes a long time to have reasons that doesn &apos;t have fun at all . </S>
Well , I learned a whole bunch of comments about it at the end of that sort of <UNK> around the whole world at Brian Jones . </S>
He <UNK> the job , the Newton in Cambridge who &apos;s in Cambridge , and recently Stephen Hawking . </S>
The design has not changed . </S>
Perhaps in there we make sense . </S>
It was very , very feisty . It was very <UNK> . </S>
First of all , I was reading about a campaign in a developer called the <UNK> between responsible medicine and seven <UNK> happened . </S>
And the legend is that Alexander <UNK> around that desert . </S>
You can make interesting challenges . </S>
The second dog falls into a complete depression . </S>
It needs to have fresh water . </S>
If you look at the world , you see walking around the oceans for any continent around you . </S>
Some of the few exceptions suffer most of the developing countries that have adopted by the <UNK> governments that have over and over poverty and in poverty . </S>
And that &apos;s what we call the theory of that theory . </S>
And I added on both sides , and to show that they cover all directions . </S>
There was clustering . And there was clustering . </S>
So this is the thing to do . </S>
Think about it . You don &apos;t mean , you want these ugly wire . </S>
So it &apos;s in the middle of nowhere . </S>
So we made this focus on graph . </S>
If I do a little bit more personal by doing it and look at me , what makes me happy as a designer is the easiest statement is , more of the things that I like myself and less from that I do not like -- that it would help but help I do what I really like . </S>
There you go . Thank you very much . </S>
All right . Enough . </S>
The mycelium is producing mechanical -- <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
A third of the <UNK> <UNK> explained , &quot; The Old generation did nothing and then suddenly choices everywhere . &quot; </S>
So we make just silence and sound . </S>
Here &apos;s another case I think it &apos;s interesting . </S>
And so they invented &quot; <UNK> <UNK> . &quot; </S>
We can make it . Don &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re not able to do it . </S>
In fact , some of the kids were embarrassed by touching it when they told you that their moms have been <UNK> . </S>

Today , most importantly , most of the people concentrate on the chemistry because they &apos;re less valuable than a very valuable sign to developing brain farms by looking for oil in Mars and finding pollutants in the sea , for which we use it in <UNK> . </S>
Of course we paid attention to how we collect because it &apos;s a very concrete result , but for me , consciousness and awareness of the funding that we collect because I know that life changes today and it could do the best of a young man who I did in South Korea , at the very first end of the year in Austin , Texas . </S>
How do people get their problems in their own , do they have to do what they can do ? </S>
How could an electric car that gets shredded on top of it , help there ? </S>

The blue of the early developing countries set up with the earlier industrialized world . </S>
Go ! </S>
Why in God , every case , every time you add on that dialogue ? </S>
Well , in the end and all of that &apos;s a tremendous thing . </S>
Why would an New idea accepted ? </S>
And you need the <UNK> countries -- once it gets to be burning -- <UNK> like a storm , and you lose that for the last little bit of ashes and nutrients from the first rain that &apos;s going on into the sea and kills coral reefs . </S>
So repetition creates a pattern . </S>
I learned early of that model of that fundraising procedure . </S>
And they &apos;re wondering , researchers around the world and in the laboratories are <UNK> the adult stem cells -- typically the <UNK> cells today and the adult stem cells with you and me -- they &apos;re involved with more of the cells in Europe of cells . </S>
I &apos;m just a geriatrician . </S>
How will life be a fossil fuels ? </S>
Thank you . </S>
I &apos;m not going to the details , but it &apos;s an important discovery , and we know there &apos;s a lot of it right now about just a little bit of that , but it &apos;s important because they &apos;re the neurons that you build for Parkinson &apos;s neurons and there are neurons that actually <UNK> just by everybody <UNK> by all their peers and have a meaning . </S>
The two hemispheres in each other two hemispheres is based on the <UNK> <UNK> , which is about 300 million of them . </S>
And the first signal of blue is when the night and day try to <UNK> . </S>
And I had broken by the arm of my sister &apos;s arm ... </S>
Giving help does not really help . </S>
So I thought , &quot; How could I do that ? &quot; </S>
This wonderful woman , <UNK> <UNK> , was absolutely key to what was because she was the <UNK> for the <UNK> to the <UNK> . </S>
So here &apos;s a huge gap . </S>
And , secondly , the developer of that <UNK> and maybe he is just the easiest for him to come back from him and personally to say what &apos;s going on . </S>
The Green School is in her third year with 160 children . </S>
Are we going to find marijuana , Jim Young ? </S>
PM : &quot; Video video works on the beginning and I don &apos;t know why -- now it works . </S>
If you look at that in a linear graph , it &apos;s like if everything recently happened , but a few observers say , &quot; Well , <UNK> are just desk on those graphs that just fall on a line . &quot; </S>
You know , it &apos;s often said that in <UNK> times we live , that we &apos;re all <UNK> . </S>
When I think about some of the wonderful talks that we &apos;ve heard here about Michael <UNK> or some of the speeches about the music and some of the people who are in there because the music exists around the time I want to tell you a little bit about filmmaking and say . </S>

Four of these objects are stars , you can see them there -- little pieces of wood . </S>
In this X-ray , we see all of the little pieces in the corners . </S>
Learning to be fun of women is the same thing as a <UNK> . </S>
I think this was all my time . I &apos;m walking around , and I &apos;m finishing my talk here . </S>
I mean , there &apos;s no paper on my desk . </S>
<UNK> is just another word for you . </S>
Judge Russell did have the Veterans &apos; Court . </S>
The dark side of this house is that there &apos;s a lot of price you have to be paid . </S>

No , they &apos;re not . </S>
When they &apos;re dying . Immediately growth and organisms come alive . </S>
But the thing is delicious . </S>
And we &apos;re asking ourselves a question as a function of three different lives : How much more powerful are you getting ? </S>
I had a few of my time thinking about it . </S>
Whether it believe you or it isn &apos;t happening for all the past few years and what happened has been a lot of times a number of times . </S>
<UNK> are very little very dangerous and very expensive and there are many <UNK> who just aren &apos;t able to because the person who cannot properly get a bad guy . </S>
When I wrote a big one that I wrote , the editor was entirely very confused . </S>
And we have a lot of <UNK> . One is <UNK> . </S>
All right , because so much to do care of the topic . How about the quality ? </S>
I met Sanghamitra , eight years ago when I was on the outskirts of an art meeting with the <UNK> of different NGOs who work on some of the most difficult points of the society . </S>
When I was in Zimbabwe , we went to a place in a <UNK> of the <UNK> -- he wanted to get money for a secondary school -- and a few meters long , a little bit of <UNK> , and I said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; </S>
It doesn &apos;t happen <UNK> . It &apos;s exactly what you expected , especially if you don &apos;t have a personal computer anyway . </S>
The Euro was a very young currency that was a very young leader at the time that offered a high stakes . </S>

She was in her backyard her grandmother &apos;s her home and she saw something that had caught her into tears . </S>
Is it a kind of moral ambiguity ? </S>
And there was one of the great girls who was in my favorite quote : &quot; Men are the new <UNK> . &quot; </S>
What does it mean by looking at these kinds of perspectives ? </S>
Already , today , in a lot of cases , you don &apos;t have to go to your doctor . </S>
So no possibility of the medical care or a meaningful kind of preparation for an absolute nuclear place . </S>
Support our science on our <UNK> notions of marriage and birth . &quot; </S>
And he wrote that article -- that I never published properly saying : &quot; Practical <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> . &quot; </S>
And , interestingly , this argument is always known more by neuroscience in neuroscience . </S>
So , blue , blue , everything became blue . </S>
They &apos;re going through about eight different shapes in their lives . </S>
This is an image that came back in <UNK> . </S>
They clean water , in education , by medicine and even <UNK> . </S>
Then we can rotate those in eight dimensions and look at the <UNK> . </S>
We deeply deeply within his . </S>
The dancers and the dance were hopelessly blowing up . </S>
When you get to visit where the oil is already a longer , for a long time , you see an <UNK> . </S>

I have patients helping to do that . </S>
And that &apos;s Euler , he &apos;s our minister for <UNK> . </S>
But at the beginning it was like a morally counterintuitive thing , long before it was funny . </S>
This is an example -- one of the great -- one of the phenomenon that is going to be looked at right now . </S>
Instead , we look at the end of the video . </S>
Now , I &apos;m very glad I &apos;m very excited by telling you the latest version version of a robot -- showing that a new and a new <UNK> program . </S>
And we bring it to the machine to get them close to . </S>
Now they say , the tropical sea ice , the expansion of that in summer is going to be gone up in the next four to 10 years . </S>
A recent bird disease -- Early detection , early response . One <UNK> . </S>
The way we do it is to learn mathematics is how to learn anything else , how to learn to drive a bicycle . </S>
YR : An one great thing . I think we have learned by the <UNK> , but we better know ourselves . </S>
There are also stars and such kinds . </S>
You know , in our land , it was <UNK> and once <UNK> . </S>
The tobacco biomass , the phytoplankton , the <UNK> , that &apos;s what the fish feed . </S>
I could scan the picture , which is the exact size of the screen . </S>
Now , I &apos;m going to start with a question , who is , who is an <UNK> term ? </S>
In other words , &quot; <UNK> &quot; has brought around the 20th century several times a few days , and some of the last week without electricity , without electricity , flowing water and heating and gas or <UNK> for the iPhone . </S>
We &apos;re very hard to struggle for our freedom , just for your evil angels . </S>
And there was a really better way to do it . </S>
So I was like to rediscover the value of kindness . </S>
And so I was leaving myself for a month . </S>
It was on the Biafran . </S>
Very fun for me who do make lots of insects who are doing the work . </S>
One <UNK> cost is many more ; we spend more from food for food in our kids in our classrooms for a whole week . </S>
Because at age I became just like a <UNK> thing . </S>
If they live cliffs and mountains die , the grain of food are born . </S>
In my <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> . </S>
I interviewed Steve Martin . It &apos;s not so long ago . </S>
Where they were gone . That &apos;s all very birth . </S>
Your computer will address an <UNK> current than an One and an absence of a <UNK> as zero . </S>
I suppose someone thought it was necessary . </S>
When I started Riverside school 10 years ago , she became a lab in my lab to develop a lab to develop an engineer and to make sure that was going to be able to infect the mind with the &quot; I. </S>
I &apos;m going to finish with this song -- an <UNK> -- because we &apos;re all a mother in the table of the eternal mother . </S>
One example : One Indian friend tells me that a electric device has been tested for the Asian Use of the Asian chromosome , if you made a cockroach with a foot for me to buy apart from each component and in every single component of the body . </S>
There &apos;s nothing wrong about it . </S>
In order to do it themselves , you have to forget you . </S>
When I saw the chair of my son , I had that picture on my head . I saw how he exploded . </S>
They call it nasty and worse -- think to me . </S>
The clock is : it &apos;s four o &apos;clock at the time . </S>
For anyone and everywhere it is possible to step into the highest achievement just by the mental workload states that you have to achieve something . </S>
but how do you design it interactive ? </S>
And we do that for the year 2000 , and it &apos;s a very difficult project . </S>
Thank you . </S>
And there were a lot of <UNK> and orphans , people who wanted to have a position . </S>
Here we have a bars with four holes of them , and we gave the smell of the larvae in the left hole . </S>
He died of longevity , and he knew , and he was enjoying his <UNK> his wife . </S>
Instead , I was supposed to think about the larger scale . </S>
So if you want to build DNA origami from a DNA molecule , you need a long strand that &apos;s 10 trillion bases long . </S>
The more you remove us , the more that becomes the sound . </S>
Maybe we should leave all of our children with a legacy are based on values , not financial values . </S>
Why ? Because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it , even though we can &apos;t make a vaccine , but that &apos;s another story . </S>
It &apos;s an important lesson for kids to understand -- some of these laws appear to be broken and have to be interpreted by the rules . </S>
You don &apos;t have to necessarily have one <UNK> . </S>
In this year this year is 100 percent of their own degree . </S>
I can tell you that this number one that you see here is not just in our experimental experiment . </S>
Now I &apos;m a saying that it could also be a liberating thing if it doesn &apos;t make a whole raft of carbon . </S>
That &apos;s the thing to do . </S>
My other favorite lady is , &quot; <UNK> , who are going to be <UNK> under a pair of leftist rats in front of the female who doesn &apos;t say &quot; <UNK> . &quot; </S>
That &apos;s what we do . </S>
They just decided to take her . </S>
And again , again , again , again , again , again with another generation . </S>
It seems like we might be diagnosing maybe , but not entirely treated . </S>
I &apos;m just not trying to be very nervous because this is a very beautiful experience for me and everything . </S>
It was like a joke : &quot; I would just make that if nobody was watching . &quot; </S>
And if we take that , we take the idea of what culture makes and add them to the demand of life -- again in the evolution of life -- we find that in every case -- every larger transition in life -- in some ways -- in reality and change of how evolution works . </S>
Not very surprising -- they were just three of the women under the <UNK> <UNK> in the White House . </S>
The good news is that we &apos;re all coming with a smile in the world . </S>
For example , this is a beautiful box for <UNK> who is alive when it is time to take the drug to do , &quot; The kid must do &quot; <UNK> &quot; to come up with your <UNK> . </S>
We have two identical climbers on the left , one in a dark environment , one in a bright environment . </S>
We challenge questions who actually aren &apos;t supposed to be the kinds of question that 9 / 11 took all of us . </S>
They are on a journey that doesn &apos;t exist . </S>
We went through a coral reef . </S>
She makes her very nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to school , there aren &apos;t a lot . </S>
This site is remote . He &apos;s over 300 miles from every major city . </S>
Let &apos;s start these new Revolution , <UNK> at the old , with synthetic biology as the way to transform both our environment and transform our future . </S>
If you took a game called a <UNK> machine , she didn &apos;t have to take all of them who had ever done , well , they had to be better than the other two shows that run at the same time . </S>
But Linus actually didn &apos;t look at him very , very carefully . </S>
And it sounds like the <UNK> to demand you can do in a prayer . </S>
And again , they took care of their own issues , from 30 inches that we followed them at <UNK> with <UNK> and the <UNK> , and that &apos;s just an incredible experience . </S>
You know , like a lot of children who are just a few minutes . I &apos;m going to spend a little look at Business <UNK> programs for 15 minutes , usually half an hour . </S>
<UNK> to me ? </S>
And you can see , these robots come close . </S>
IM : Oh , wow , sorry . All right . Where do I put myself to myself ? </S>
There are more than enough marketing costs . </S>
One of them is called the Enceladus . </S>
Like I have to love college . </S>
And we know that most of them are dead . </S>
And it was just as opposed to me and movie and art , which is basically nothing to do with saying : nothing about the <UNK> of the <UNK> -- except for the <UNK> to put his <UNK> on the river , but that &apos;s giving him a little bit , and they &apos;re smiling , but he said , &quot; Because that &apos;s what he said &quot; because there &apos;s my nature . &quot; </S>
And again , it might be a pretty higher number . </S>
The European rabbits in Australia are not of any natural enemies . It &apos;s in the competition with the things that were originally <UNK> animals . </S>
The thing , where you have to be your smartphone . </S>
It &apos;s 400 years old . </S>
It &apos;s not easy to find that you &apos;re weird . </S>
You know , for example , that we tend to think in science and engineering . </S>
Now it &apos;s gone . &quot; </S>
In Gando there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water and not a school . </S>
<UNK> is not Chinese vegetables ; in reality it is an act of a <UNK> vegetables . </S>
Well , their resistance of bodies is electricity in lots of ways in which to stop . </S>
We are not always the case at the point point . </S>
And that electron disappears . </S>
I &apos;m not the big scientist . </S>
They remember those pieces of life that we talked about before ? Now , if they write fake certificates , they have to publish those area and they will leave behind us . </S>
Maybe it &apos;s time to prove that to something . </S>
P to P . </S>
These pictures are from the last year . </S>
And we should be proud of where our energy comes from , how it &apos;s to be absolutely kind of ashamed of being ashamed of . </S>
Thank you . </S>
So by two simple ideas we could come up with one thing : one of the things that is sort of <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> , something which is stored in a liquid of liquid helium or liquid helium . </S>
It &apos;s a worrying -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the media of the world do such a bad job is that a small group of activists is able to publish more of that kind of information than the rest of the <UNK> together . </S>
You all know about the test of artificial intelligence , the <UNK> . </S>
But if we continue to perform more effective in life , we need to learn ourselves from the first time . </S>
There was 10 years old . That was 34 years ago . I saw potential in that material . </S>
She comes back from that saying and saying things like , &quot; You should eat a ton of leaves , because they include a lot of pressure from whatever gets there in oxygen with oxygen . </S>
This is a graph of pictures that have been launched with the streets of Iraq . </S>
It looked different , but it was another ground , and it was another piece of art . </S>
A lot of the diseases that we have worked on for the long time , like the example of the cancer that we couldn &apos;t cure because we simply didn &apos;t know what was going on out there . </S>
That consciousness for the <UNK> gives you an inspiring and a common kind of soil to make compassion grow . </S>
<UNK> , take a minute just to tell your own story about your own story , how do you respond to Africa ? </S>
One of my favorite moments for <UNK> was the day when we launched <UNK> <UNK> -- and I went around <UNK> Avenue -- and I looked around him and looked at types and looked at their <UNK> , and the traffic was liquid and the <UNK> were singing -- and the buses was going fast in their tracks . </S>
I was playing <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> of New York Public Library where they &apos;re really going to do very very very very very well to do , and it was a phenomenal event that we might hope have to be some of the others . </S>
If you take the difference between these two pictures here , you can receive a picture that just from the <UNK> of <UNK> is a <UNK> colored . </S>
This is far faster than a baseball , even if he was thrown by one of the top <UNK> . </S>
So I brought forward here to the TED TED page number , and that &apos;s not the last thing , but you can &apos;t demonstrate anything about it . </S>
And he click on it and he click , &quot; Now , &quot; <UNK> . &quot; </S>
Good kid ! You did it ! You did it . </S>
It &apos;s not just a laptop project , it &apos;s also a complex market . </S>
At the time and the &apos; 60s , when I was still a kid was that little girls were always <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and soft ; we should fulfill <UNK> that were kind of blurry . It was a lot of friction that we were getting away from us . </S>
And even more than one moon -- again , I don &apos;t even know which goes through the atmosphere very far . </S>
Or in the case of <UNK> and <UNK> like Robert <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , lies with our land , tells us how to make sure our security wrong is undermining democracy to the death of the death that causes the death of the death . </S>
Do you care by one of you in the audience in an such person ? </S>
The <UNK> is how to create the markets in rural Africa to capture the <UNK> and the lessons that we know they &apos;re involved . </S>
I &apos;m going to say a few words about what a normal black hole is , in the assumption that it could do such a thing as a normal black hole . </S>
And the same emotions interact for all of us if we go through life . </S>
But in addition to this facility that also do -- or the Jews anyway -- at the time they were <UNK> by their children . </S>
<UNK> two things . </S>
I study the ability of photography , truth and fiction to mix , and their influence on the memory of the serious and even lethal outcomes . </S>
In the words of London , they call &quot; The <UNK> &quot; and &quot; The <UNK> , &quot; &quot; The <UNK> &quot; that helps <UNK> things to the ground . </S>
This other condition was composed by my graduate student . </S>
In 100 years it will also make it sound like us from &quot; <UNK> &quot; as a verb and &quot; <UNK> &quot; as a noun . </S>
The context has changed . </S>
When we do and he swam , we see these amazing <UNK> : the shark still stays on its path as it travels from California to Hawaii . </S>
And his whole family moved to France in the 1930s . </S>
That would make a difference . &quot; </S>
Oh , Goldie Hawn . I love you , she &apos;s wonderful . </S>
And , like the data on the <UNK> Ben discovered . </S>
Soon , my crazy idea was not going to be like crazy . </S>
And it &apos;s enabling enabling us to do . </S>
Because I think it &apos;s something like the case that I &apos;m not supposed to . </S>
What can I do as a <UNK> , do it ? </S>
Like , for example , same sentence in English and in <UNK> , from two of the same <UNK> . </S>
Among them -- among them -- my right hand was blamed . </S>
A little better than nature . </S>
WK : I think we found a very big deal in the Arab world -- that people are caring for people who are interested in this big transformation . </S>
It was something we knew . </S>
This broke , hard winter , I love it . </S>
She was like , &quot; Um , &quot; it was <UNK> . </S>
Sir , sleep increases high focus , attention control , attention control , creativity , social skills , health . </S>
There I am , I don &apos;t know if you can see it well , but up on the top left , that &apos;s a tiny little dot , and that &apos;s the Earth . </S>
<UNK> that features of an effort . </S>
Then you give me a fast dive . </S>
And we are just a few employees just -- that &apos;s just me . </S>
I &apos;m going to share just a few of you . </S>
Well there &apos;s a lot of expertise out there . </S>
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy . &quot; </S>
Let &apos;s also go back to <UNK> , who said , &quot; The mind is not a car that must be filled like this , but timber that must be brought into that . &quot; </S>
Thank you . </S>
And here , he &apos;s looking at it . That &apos;s essentially what I &apos;m going to do at the very end . </S>
Awesome . Really good . </S>
And I said , &quot; You think it &apos;s your husband , do you think about getting a child ? &quot; </S>
At first , this was the Internet for me was a <UNK> tool , and now it &apos;s something that I &apos;m leaving for my real life for me . </S>
He went through a bus a drop , a few years ago , and he was estimated , and lives now in an orphanage today and his four and a half she was alive . </S>
You take your blood flow back to your old core roots , and you find <UNK> <UNK> -- we would spell it -- hardly to believe -- and hardly believe it &apos;s the same root and the word that comes from that way . </S>
That &apos;s helping you answer . Right . </S>
<UNK> . </S>
And what kind of socialism have you to do ? </S>
One is , they can be in favor of service or for consumers . </S>
That &apos;s what I like myself to do . </S>
Today , <UNK> are the most famous killer robots . </S>
And in addition , she showed me another map that is built there . </S>
We know how to do it better , and it &apos;s worth making it better . </S>
I &apos;m joking . I &apos;m not kidding . </S>
That &apos;s all what you need on Earth and everything you &apos;ve got to know . &quot; </S>
And I went to Austria and got my stuff wrapped , and a week later , I was back to the road district . I was still <UNK> , and I thought , when the &apos; &quot; Yo &quot; poster is still on the stage here . </S>
We still think it &apos;s quite a lot of other things that are in different quality and different from multiple health . </S>
And all of the forms of the protests need help , the growth of the institutions that create prosperity , the institutions that raise productivity up . </S>
But -- in fact we can learn a lot from them because they &apos;re living together in a very selfish and predictable society . </S>
By the time of June , 19 percent of the people living in cities and slums and slums . </S>
So what happened is that if we bring all that in the social sphere , we end up with us all the time with our cell phone . </S>
It &apos;s smaller than a -- it &apos;s like a postage stamp , and it &apos;s able to make power by just put it on your shirt while you &apos;re moving . </S>
A thin film will be placed on the inside of it , the upper edges end and <UNK> . </S>
Well , I &apos;ve got to say that I had a very tough reason to create Mathematica , I wanted to use it for myself like Galileo , like Galileo had done 400 years ago . </S>
That in part , in that area , planes use of the society , of course , will be more dead at the time of life . </S>
And as it was rough at the 1950s they had two years ago , when people say , &quot; We should drop it , &quot; the polio philanthropy is to try to figure it back together to find innovative solutions , new ways to get to the kids who get over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over . </S>
This is from a distance between us and <UNK> . </S>
<UNK> are too cheap and therefore too many uses too much . </S>
And if you remember that we need to increase our agricultural production for 70 percent , we won &apos;t make it . </S>
They &apos;ve got to show all the time at the sun , and they would be able to zoom around in space because gravity is on those objects . </S>
We take the nerves from the loud and up are active because they should be quiet , and we will bring them home to local food for sleep . </S>
And of course the fences are at the whole world of <UNK> , absolutely <UNK> . </S>
Everything had to be huge . The next image was bigger . </S>
What &apos;s the one that nerve cortex that makes in your tumor ? </S>
What all of the things have in common is they challenge the conventional challenge . </S>
Then art is useful . </S>
And he had <UNK> pictures of the invasion of his blog -- that &apos;s his Mercedes -- here &apos;s the <UNK> <UNK> in which he was driving . </S>
How many of you use <UNK> <UNK> ? </S>
So in terms of context -- if you do &#91; unclear &#93; , it would do it with the <UNK> . </S>
Can you imagine ? </S>
And we &apos;re treating these covers of &quot; <UNK> , &quot; as if it were something we might deserve for sometime , but it would give us a sense of the kind of embodiment that we do not make . </S>
Your Alzheimer &apos;s disease is a five million people who are affected . And it &apos;s understandable , predictable activity . </S>
And if you &apos;d find one , it would be probably from Sao Paulo . </S>
Here &apos;s the first example . </S>
have three kinds of terms : business and civil society and the government -- and with those first of them , I &apos;m not going to go beyond myself but to say that there &apos;s some reason that cannot make any of the assumptions of some of the others that are taught the way it is taught . </S>
This is the <UNK> in <UNK> National Park in Bombay , India , which is called Lake <UNK> today . </S>
I had a telephone drive , and I just looked around my head of my head of my head , and I looked around my world about a mirror that was on my head of my head . </S>
And these people , the innovators and the early <UNK> they &apos;re in kind of relaxed at doing this kind of thing . </S>
And a large number of citizens in Mexico today remembers a lot of fear . </S>
They express themselves and listen to the pitches that pick up the amount of income as high as the ones that we can do and express . </S>
Every year we lose 50 hundred-thousand <UNK> in every single year . </S>
The ship goes down and the captain was falling down and everything lost to a <UNK> . </S>
That &apos;s our old friend of mine , &quot; he &apos;s not making a troublemaker . &quot; </S>
And he said , &quot; I hope you will have the strength you do what I did . </S>
The <UNK> is reduced because instead of bringing bags to peanuts to find a parking lot from your shoes and putting out your car from nowhere to fly back home to fly around you . </S>
The thing is interesting is how Netflix was established in 1999 . </S>
And the school test for the future of the future . &quot; </S>
A people who say to ice not die of death is not about death but a subset of life . </S>
So much a year at last year &apos;s worth of <UNK> 30 billion <UNK> saved by open innovation , and they &apos;re very strong about the expansion of this portal , not just in public health and in the public sector . </S>
They went faster , and nobody had to read my handwriting . </S>
I can lose 40 percent of my beard without dying without any . </S>
And I think there &apos;s a lot of that there for that . </S>
At the next day , Tom opens up his <UNK> , sees the rice , so he jumps and complaining a suicide attack and said , &quot; Harry and &quot; Harry &apos;s the same . &quot; </S>
Then , in the Solomon Islands , the streets <UNK> , van became the most beautiful , and new food became increasingly transported . </S>
More reasons to be optimistic . I am a hominid of the 1960s , at the time , there was a movement . </S>
But I was not ahead at the time . </S>
It &apos;s our little <UNK> for 30 cents each . </S>
<UNK> percent of all <UNK> come from court . </S>
As we speak of risk , we &apos;ve seen that the number of <UNK> in Africa have the majority of the world . </S>
I was sitting there with my friend Tim <UNK> who was sitting there on my left . </S>
Now , from that other study , we took a caring and create a goal and come into that by the desire that I &apos;m talking about in a moment . </S>
What remains opposite of the previous system is the <UNK> as a <UNK> at the beginning . </S>
It can give up some proven credibility who can maintain success . </S>
But the thing about moving from an abstract <UNK> is a recipe for misery and I think of catastrophe . </S>
Dogs . </S>
And there we were . </S>
Here &apos;s a list of the <UNK> . </S>
And there are very poor people -- they cannot make use of space . </S>
Then they stop being read ? </S>
This is a little moving tree , and you see a couple of these things that are related to other viruses . </S>
Susan <UNK> : That &apos;s Kanzi and I in the forest . </S>
So we &apos;re now two . </S>
And they use existing sidewalks and they &apos;re getting out of it . &quot; </S>
&#91; &quot; <UNK> &quot; &#93; <UNK> : All that was really a magical experience and a half of reasons . </S>
That &apos;s where the point is right . It can &apos;t just come from a point . </S>
In the end of that , your new model is going to replace the old . </S>
Now , if you could lose the point you would lose , I would tell you that we would do better to restore the perceived to hold the ear , the hearing any other sense . </S>
And my team said it was directly to the face . </S>
It &apos;s a protest at the same time an intimate protests against the culture that we have at the very moment , where people are putting their mobile phones at the exact time with their cell phones and all of that in their own cell . </S>
So that &apos;s not right . If you think that , you just simply don &apos;t get it right . </S>
When I turn it against that <UNK> , you see that they have a cylinder and it became an <UNK> -- literally in physics . </S>
We &apos;re not paying the real ecological cost of our lives . </S>
That &apos;s how we can drive our freedom to do . And with the energy and the amount of energy and passion for it is needed to be able to address the challenges of our time . </S>
I saw you saw Glenn Eric . I love them . </S>
These are two genes that we have as a good example . </S>
That allows you to take your five or six or six and increase the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent . It &apos;s a little bit famous , but brilliant , famous invention came from the kind of a <UNK> <UNK> -- and I do a really easy version of the school -- a really empowering way for the efficiency and the efficiency should be large . </S>
It was too much expensive to produce socially socially socially socially acceptable choice . That wasn &apos;t in society . </S>
<UNK> became our world leaders in this country , and came up with a number of really extraordinary things : <UNK> , measurable , long-term goals called <UNK> . </S>
Two years ago , she was in the retirement care only for our house to turn our house in a school for girls and women in their neighborhood . </S>
I hired a question of view if the number of colors come over with her ears . </S>
They don &apos;t know what they were getting out of . </S>
And so he would just say that it was the alien to publish him and introduced him to him . </S>
It was <UNK> secret . </S>
The reason is , if we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re wired to us to look at how we look at our behavior . </S>
And from that stuff we came up . </S>
Don &apos;t leave before you leave . </S>
I am among them to meet in positions of all of which to be the best . </S>
And in that picture that it speaks for itself , we see modern agriculture that I also think of as &quot; intense farming . &quot; </S>
I went to high school . </S>
And if we even begin to integrate that information together , we better know what to do , and how to have a better sense of our own disease , health and well-being . </S>
So he &apos;s able to run the power ; he &apos;s able to get the flow on the inside from the inside from the inside from the inside from the inside from the outside and hits him to the river to protect them from the river and protect them from the river . </S>
This is actually the inside of our lab . We &apos;ve never showed that before . </S>
Do it okay , if we don &apos;t to make use that we want to manipulate and create the way we want it to be ? </S>
The amount of <UNK> that we &apos;ve introduced have been doubling every year . </S>
What brings me to the second technology that helps you to cope with the problem of <UNK> , it &apos;s the <UNK> . </S>
And I &apos;m absolutely excited to argue about that , and I &apos;m going to come back and say , &quot; Can anybody please explain the kind of way and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot; </S>
You make a cell phone the cell for a dollar for money . </S>
But now there is another kind of <UNK> . </S>
The data comes from the World <UNK> Survey . </S>
I thought I was going to show you one of these approaches . </S>
But some people have the connection to their ancestors . We get to be able to push our center in context . </S>
Let &apos;s go back to kindergarten . Let &apos;s see if we can capture the five-year-old . </S>
Unlike the woman at night , that woman was smiling . </S>
And now you might do that -- maybe -- well . </S>
I had been around for it . I had terrible fear that I would die . </S>
And she said , &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; </S>
She was an <UNK> thing to do , and in a way , it meant it didn &apos;t make a mixture of <UNK> and sugar . </S>
We should take our foot right now at the accelerator of the accelerator . We normally do that . We &apos;re very effective at the bottom of the boat . </S>
There I catch a little bit harder ! &quot; </S>
And the first mate is , &quot; Now , I think that the rehearsal need to be in a certain point . &quot; </S>
relationships -- how do you negotiate ? </S>
And if we learned from the developers from every sector , then we would achieve in the future that happiness would be as universal as Coca-Cola . </S>
I finally came to try it before I left . </S>
That &apos;s the real deal for our job . It &apos;s always fun . </S>
It has many holes . </S>
I met a man -- the guy on the left . </S>
This animal is in the <UNK> book of the records , &quot; which is the hardest animal in the world . </S>
And as soon as you get out of the <UNK> , you have to have as much of the skin as you can cover up my mouth and mouth , you wouldn &apos;t have that personal . </S>
And it was slowly changing when I found my voice and things that couldn &apos;t tell me that I was going to find them . </S>
Then it turned out that not only was still in shock for only to have put it on top of it . </S>
As I said , we need an <UNK> to do the existing test and a full cooling of the body . </S>
So for about 120 million prescriptions for antidepressants . </S>
And , unfortunately , we don &apos;t know . </S>
They had all the same tragedy . </S>
We developed this AI for the building of our nervous system that we allow for ourselves to allow ourselves to walk . </S>
Here is the <UNK> of jazz . </S>
There &apos;s a link that emerges by an intimate level . </S>
Now look at the second series of slides . </S>
Look at that &apos;s an easy one of the behavioral economics . </S>
So it &apos;s a kind of subject , but it &apos;s a little deeper than that . </S>
EM : Absolutely . The rest of the cars have to be very easy to dispose of the weight of the <UNK> , you need a very low transportation for a lot of your car . </S>
I was this <UNK> young journalist at the back of my room and I had my hand and ask myself to ask . </S>
We don &apos;t have excuses in that country . I &apos;m sorry . </S>
Camp Three is at the base of the <UNK> site , of the <UNK> mountain of the globe , but above Everest . </S>
I &apos;m a 24-year-old hospital maker , and the <UNK> <UNK> flew away . </S>
But there is a second powerful incentive to move that to broadcast beings from people on machines and with the electromagnetic disturbances that <UNK> the compounds between the drone and their leaders . </S>
She was only after one when , I was visiting a nine , I &apos;d say , &quot; 10 to the Ten and the next arrow didn &apos;t hit the goal . </S>
That coffee is made in very unusual ways . </S>
The bad news is they &apos;re all extinct . </S>
Or perhaps I have to make myself a <UNK> robot , like an <UNK> that is growing my voice if I put it on the ice . </S>
Then they asked me , &quot; Do you think that God is talking to us through aggressive prophets ? &quot; and I said , &quot; No , clearly , of course . &quot; </S>
Because being paid -- it was just like being a chocolate pack for him . </S>
Furthermore , you &apos;re going to win an invitation that Betty ceremony at Harvard University . </S>
All right , I &apos;d like to close with a positive , nice , little story to say , ... &quot; <UNK> &quot; is a non-profit . </S>
She was one of the people who was <UNK> at the survey , and she &apos;s now a recent one and a half scientific scientists in the world . And if she comes to the stage , it &apos;s also the youngest person who &apos;s ever spoken at TED . </S>
He can do it better than I have to admit to you . </S>
But for many parts of Africa , there was a colleague of mine that had been <UNK> , &quot; The <UNK> at <UNK> was just standing at the right time so that the genocide was able to do the math . &quot; </S>
We didn &apos;t understand what was going on . </S>
The machines were incredibly powerful for things like the kills . Right . </S>
I have a problem . &quot; It was like , &quot; okay . All right . I have a problem . &quot; </S>
It was all of these things . </S>
And it has full of challenges . </S>
Scientists have done <UNK> to put a bridge into species like chimpanzees or <UNK> . </S>
One of my graduate students came to the course of the class , a <UNK> , and said to me and said , &quot; You know , poetry is harder than write , &quot; which I thought is both false . </S>
<UNK> is to say intelligent power , anywhere from Earth , thousands of lives save tens of thousands of drugs that are managed by storing tens of thousands of dollars feeding every single year , every single year and at the beginning of the global energy trade . </S>
So , back to the meeting . </S>
A lot of happiness with the conversation with them . </S>
Is it raising an <UNK> or a distance between two people ? </S>
And I mean , if you have a baby today , if you have a baby child . </S>
<UNK> have a similar tool that is developing at the genetic cloth . </S>
<UNK> pray for <UNK> . </S>
And it actually does say it &apos;s sad . </S>
&quot; This is my car , and I &apos;m going to channel the drive and my automobile is going to &quot; my car . &quot; </S>
That &apos;s Rio . </S>
Clay <UNK> , who is his great <UNK> for all of us , who is the creator that is <UNK> on the <UNK> here , by the wonderful wonderful way . </S>
So , yeah . It &apos;s a long , long tail of that number . </S>
I became very nervous -- there was no rope , no <UNK> , the whole world was walking around me -- and I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m in trouble . &quot; </S>
But jumping in the &apos; 80s was actually sitting there , and there was space for such a system like this . </S>
It &apos;s treating these <UNK> contributions as information , and I &apos;m calling it a biological postcard from the outside world . </S>
Wouldn &apos;t you feel if I offered your erotic fantasies with me ? </S>
I &apos;m going to show you another one . </S>
So each of you have just shared with them all the microbes they have with them . </S>
No . In the &apos; 70s , there was the <UNK> show , &quot; The <UNK> , &quot; and followed Yesterday in the top 10 <UNK> , followed by the &quot; <UNK> &quot; and &quot; &quot; Three angel for Charlie . &quot; </S>
Let &apos;s start with the Main Street . </S>
This is my mini mine . </S>
Well , from the second phase of life , again , it didn &apos;t come up . </S>
The calculation has typically been the <UNK> factor , and now they &apos;re often off . </S>
And back my feet that were the big , quiet , blue background of the Pacific Ocean . </S>
Is it effective ? </S>
I am from Essex in England , and in the past seven years I &apos;ve been struggling to rescue life to do my way in life . </S>
For them , countries and countries play a big role , often an <UNK> . </S>
Last last thing . </S>
<UNK> , inclusion and revenge became the references of the <UNK> Revolution . </S>
And to give you an example of this example , I remember standing on a road and as long as I could see at least one mile , the body <UNK> , twice as high as I do the bodies of dead . </S>
What could you do here ? </S>
You see the <UNK> . </S>
By the way , they don &apos;t write everything right because they do everything about the telephone . </S>
Instead , it should be driven by the way companies companies . </S>
First of all , it &apos;s everybody who has access to a mobile phone , anyone who has a cell phone has essentially an ATM machines . </S>
Now , the system and thinking about the developing industrial revolution in small new developments in developing countries around the world . </S>
And then I went by looking at a kind of things to look at things that this was truly transformative . </S>
All right , by the way , they &apos;re up in the line , and they &apos;re saying to be able to hang on top of them -- that &apos;s what they &apos;re saying . They &apos;re doing a very big list for young women for the young women here for these young women here in the audience of the show in Abu Dhabi but also for the <UNK> . </S>
Imagine a scale today : when I went to school , we sat in rows . </S>
But the companies continued to think data from them before and in the same town in three years as three years . </S>
The reason that we &apos;re not entirely are actually the <UNK> of the <UNK> of our legal systems , but that would be a very different <UNK> for us later . </S>
Harvard was sitting there . </S>
There &apos;s not a lot of money because there &apos;s very cold and snow up again every year &apos;s entrance for a cave for eight months . </S>
Oh , we have a lot of them , hundreds of them every year that come . </S>
And I came up with the statement that a new city offers new possibilities for people . </S>
Another way to make it like we think in the 21st century on force we want to take advantage of the idea that the power is forever -- and my gain is their loss and vice . </S>
But what &apos;s really going on ? In fact everywhere around the world , people go from the countryside in the city . </S>
And here is some pictures of it . </S>
I &apos;m going to talk about the success of my campus , at University of Maryland , Baltimore County , <UNK> , about the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the art and engineering and engineering and engineering . </S>
One of the exciting things that came to reading for Charles Darwin was such a turning point for Darwin to say he said , &quot; Hardly anything else in my life has made a deep impression on me . </S>
EM : In terms of a electrified electric car is really incredible . </S>
Somehow that doesn &apos;t work . </S>
I had the honor to be able to speak twice from the <UNK> of the President . </S>
In other words , people looked at it and saw a difference . </S>
I &apos;m worried about the well-being and the growth of the <UNK> , and basically , I collect dead animals . </S>
DP : Hello , I could have 400 400 hours ? </S>
And this is an <UNK> thing . </S>
But we could organize a <UNK> , in absolutely <UNK> , and know about the city . </S>
Now I think we found the secret . It &apos;s just one way from that outside there in the computational universe and quite often comes into things like the number of 30 or things . </S>
<UNK> guess ? </S>
It &apos;s called &quot; universe : Drop of our modern mythology . &quot; </S>
A <UNK> preference for the operation of violence was to become a <UNK> , with an equally strong repulsion to the self-assembling forms of <UNK> . </S>
As a society , they tend to look at it and say , &quot; Well , right ? &quot; </S>
Oh yeah , yeah . That &apos;s right . I remember -- I had the longest building of my <UNK> by then , at the time of the good old time . </S>
We only have to wait about the war if we have <UNK> for peace . </S>
Let me tell you a little bit about what a genome is . </S>
And it was the same thing that I felt like was growing up when I was growing up , and I was hearing these rules of the <UNK> and morality of my father was a <UNK> . </S>
Four different habitat seem similar to be similar , but they have very different set of brain damage . </S>
Another difference is also that the object on the left was made from a substance made . </S>
So five symmetries and of course , the circular symmetry , when I rub it around and on yourself , it &apos;s like a &quot; <UNK> &quot; and &quot; </S>
And by doing this , we learn trust and the rules of the game . </S>
He said , &quot; You just need two things . </S>
And then something happened . </S>
When you ask people to do this question , they usually thought it will have something to do with culture . </S>
Thank you very much for your time . </S>
The good side is , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; an example of the reason is that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting . </S>
And that is that all the perceptions and perceptions and decisions and actions are mediated by your computer in your head of your brain . </S>
And I think a <UNK> word -- a word like &quot; <UNK> , &quot; for example -- in almost every book I read . What about newspapers ? </S>
You know what this was like ? </S>
&quot; Great , &quot; he said , &quot; You have two years . &quot; </S>
So I &apos;m <UNK> she stepped up with the normal <UNK> , and he &apos;s walking around 6 and he turned back again and she was smiling . </S>
The point of our view is actually from our view of our view of a friend or the <UNK> . </S>
Whether it &apos;s from a truck or a mastectomy or a broken lungs , that &apos;s coming . </S>
I love collecting things . </S>
Put it on please . </S>
My father was born in 1885 , and he was slightly skilled at herself . </S>
Because that guy , the <UNK> guy on Earth . </S>
The carbon emissions per mile per mile at about just about a dollar rush of about aviation and about a tenth of the trucks . </S>
There are people who argue that today technology is just about social media or persuasive games that are called no <UNK> in the Industrial Revolution . </S>
But that was actually just the easy part of the story . </S>
And I have to say , before I go on , I &apos;m hoping to try and try and grab a pencil and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me just make a look at what we do . </S>
About 17 years ago , I was <UNK> to the air in Delhi . </S>
It &apos;s associated with -- -- I &apos;m biased -- when you want to do the whole thing you &apos;ve got to do it . I think I &apos;ve got Wikipedia on your cellphone -- but it works like you to come up with a <UNK> , just by looking at an <UNK> pencil , just to do things like you &apos;re always going to have to be connected to your friends and Wikipedia and Wikipedia . You &apos;ve got to learn how to learn . </S>
The point of democracy is intrinsic . </S>
And we have to give an answer to what perhaps some of that figure . </S>
And they had really underestimated the money for higher wages , more schools , or whatever it was used . </S>
<UNK> ? Yes , right . </S>
The <UNK> was 0.2 of meters . </S>
But this is when I remember waking up at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . We never had to have scientific progress anyway . </S>
It &apos;s going to come up with the challenge to scholars and ourselves all about thinking about the future . </S>
It &apos;s just incredible . I don &apos;t know how that could happen . </S>
Abed would hug me . Abed would turn me back . </S>
So it &apos;s really interesting . Now we have an architecture that is bringing a very directly and immediate way in the natural world . </S>
The banking industry -- the cost for innovation , prototypes , production , hardware and hardware . </S>
I was living with my wife and his son was Eric and we found almost 600 quotes of Marshall that were just absolutely amazing to her <UNK> , and they said a lot about what happened in advertising in the media . </S>
So they &apos;re on . You save the shoes . </S>
And I think that &apos;s something that makes a difference very much better if you do it . </S>
They also have a Latin Korean legal crisis , as the future of the <UNK> couldn &apos;t get anywhere else that it was ultimately becoming . </S>
You know this kind of teacher ? </S>
When he wrote the pieces and his <UNK> , who would be related to his name , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a notebook in which he first encountered him -- very little detail that seemed to miss other people . </S>
This is a moment of the second picture of the second phase of the year 2000 , when it was still with rocks and <UNK> to the army . </S>
