We were drawn to the world primarily because they &apos;re good . </S>
Have you been there ? </S>
What you normally see is a brain brain , and it &apos;s gray . </S>
In essence , you will find the same results , which is beyond one particular point , which is about a couple thousand dollars above the line , improvement of wealth wealth makes sense of interest in people &apos;s happinesses . </S>
Sometimes I &apos;m frightened . I forget that it &apos;s going to me , then , let me turn around in to figure out what &apos;s going on , and go ahead . Sorry ! </S>
RB : Well , I hope it &apos;s <UNK> . That &apos;s right . </S>
I hope you all have that somebody like this . </S>
Then France , Switzerland , Germany , United Kingdom and Northern Ireland , and on top of one world , the United States is the United States . </S>
and I want to tell you a few stories . </S>
This exponential technology occurs with all of the interconnected , moral and ethical questions , and scientists tell us the public to poor what we can to do in the lab . </S>
It doesn &apos;t try to create a strawberry or a meadow or a coral reef or a coral reef . </S>
They got to get in trouble with her own Mother &apos;s own a nursing side . </S>
And I thought , I could build and build a network . </S>
Now , when I was a few years ago , I &apos;ve traveled a lot of time in Europe , and I &apos;ve been looking at design . </S>
Or someone like Dr. <UNK> <UNK> , who started the first <UNK> company in the world , the first drug will fight injustice , also known as a black one . </S>
You can do it as well . </S>
But maybe it helps to make him a hole in the head . &quot; </S>
A healthy move of a healthy lifestyle . </S>
You know , how many choices you make on a typical day ? </S>
Girls and girls who have been caught at this point are getting married , okay . </S>
And it &apos;ll make it a little easier to make a difference . </S>
AK : Well obviously Aristotle never told a kid about it , because he didn &apos;t really care about the Institute , and the holy Thomas <UNK> . </S>
But they drink it during the break , because it &apos;s hot . </S>
So that &apos;s the three players . </S>
The only people who don &apos;t experience behavior , they do not have any relationship between empathy or connection . </S>
Or , if we took off our data on gender , we &apos;ll see what &apos;s going on in terms of gender . </S>
<UNK> in the last five years had begun . </S>
Would you go to this place ? </S>
It may be that a huge market model or a sign against <UNK> or a major operating space in space that we don &apos;t even have imagined , signals that might be synthesized or something like this . </S>
And yeah , they &apos;re building roads , yeah , install phones , yes , television are being launched . </S>
And that &apos;s the point where it gets interesting . I don &apos;t want you to go out and buy a <UNK> , OK ? They can &apos;t help . OK ? OK ? </S>
Well , the first week , in which we worked ; we got the prize for 500 dollars . </S>
There &apos;s a very interesting deal , there &apos;s a copy of Philip <UNK> here . </S>
I have my task at 95 lbs . </S>
So , let &apos;s add up to a city of the size of the size , day , day , and most of these cities are more like this cities where you live or something . </S>
He said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got a suggestion for a question . &quot; </S>
The men knew that the next village islands were -- there were 4,000 miles away . </S>
I was inspired by a friend of mine . </S>
You can make a whole country . </S>
You don &apos;t hear a lot about your <UNK> victim , except , that their clothes were a little too toxic to happen , and that they were <UNK> . </S>
<UNK> swallows on his map , and flying over the continents , and the mountains and the sea . </S>
The basic concept that we want to suggest to you that I want to suggest is that you need to know what a disease is to treat -- that is now a diagnosis -- and then you need to act . </S>
In my case , my left hand has a weaker blame , even my left leg . </S>
These are the key questions . And in PISA , we learned that in good applications the citizens were going to be confident about making decisions and future for their education and not even shortly . </S>
And this is what it &apos;s all about . </S>
What excites me from the Gulf is that it &apos;s <UNK> . </S>
Now , can you say &quot; Now &quot; right ? &quot; </S>
Larry <UNK> was photographed at the scene of arrest where he was standing between two <UNK> in Gary , Indiana , right in that particular spot in front of the police . </S>
<UNK> , lifestyle and environmental . </S>
This is my niece , I love her , she is my sister &apos;s daughter . </S>
This is an intelligent infrastructure . </S>
Many of you know how she looks , except that it in the breast , all these pretty , developing , <UNK> structures . </S>
I love the way you see the world , because they see the world for the first time . </S>
Wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if we gave our great words through our <UNK> , $ 500 billion in China , causing the economic potential of women ? </S>
<UNK> , guys , but it &apos;s just a tiny , little thing that makes you different . </S>
And it &apos;s changed by one of the most significant things in the middle of Oxford . </S>
There &apos;s something much about what we &apos;re doing to do , and then we &apos;re doing something . </S>
Most ordinary people who measure temperatures are conscious . </S>
The <UNK> of millions of <UNK> around the country demand the same thing . </S>
I had social interaction with a common interaction . </S>
And we can look at the issues of <UNK> . </S>
In the end , he had the control at <UNK> <UNK> with 26 degrees . </S>
<UNK> was also an option . </S>
We &apos;ve been judged the CEO of our government . </S>
If the kids of Uganda needs a factor of thumb , Einstein could actually be right to dance to dance . </S>
It was about banking . They had something that worked for it . </S>
Let &apos;s see . Let &apos;s look . Here we go . </S>
What you &apos;re looking at here is a three miles long , <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> in Brooklyn . <UNK> hard to make it hard to take . </S>
He said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s have the argument before you &apos;re playing a good thing . </S>
And here you see here , the <UNK> of an industry in a <UNK> , an armor that is rooted with nature . </S>
So the easiest example of this is the <UNK> please . </S>
In one day , eight times , it had to wrap up by making two types of forms . </S>
True is emotional , fluent , and most importantly , they &apos;re human . </S>
But in a way , it &apos;s a complicated concept , &quot; I &quot; have , &quot; and &quot; I &quot; have to take &quot; Tiger &quot; and mix with other people . </S>
I wanted to support them . </S>
Well , in my part , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . </S>
This three-dimensional energy we refer to as the mass of an agency and the discovery of the Higgs record clearly by the LHC clearly proving that this substance is real , because it is the recycling . </S>
You see a lot of stars . </S>
I think , in a sense of the challenge , to be able to <UNK> wonder , we can ask questions , at least in this last minute that might seem perhaps out of forever . </S>
Isn &apos;t that crazy what you saw ? </S>
A large and common part of our recycling system basically push the rivers up until the sea . </S>
You know , and to trip we go back to another side of the Chinese , and we decide that we actually have the best ever built technology that connects us to the rest of the world . </S>
And then , you know , am I crazy ? </S>
No miracle forbid you &apos;re going to disengage . </S>
It &apos;s not bad , isn &apos;t it ? </S>
So this red line is the relationship of women &apos;s employment , unlike , in what most common people in America , they have the work . </S>
You know , they &apos;ve been trying to do that . </S>
I guess what you are you to think about , what happens with the boat on you ? </S>
They are the same , by the way , that it &apos;s quite economic . </S>
It &apos;s a <UNK> in technology and the doctrine . </S>
You can &apos;t actually build a lot on top of a roof , aren &apos;t they built . </S>
And it &apos;s in the center of trust between trust and attention , is something wonderful . </S>
PM : Okay , how do we look for the balance after we look around in the world ? </S>
So I was looking around , because I thought they were just moved out in the first place , but I saw no one . </S>
The brain activity which turned inside the monkey has turned to Japan to be able to get the robot to be pulled back from the air back to Duke so that the monkey was starting to see the object look like the face of the robot . </S>
If I was <UNK> evil for Islam and <UNK> , I &apos;m rewarding to paradise . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> is 97 years . </S>
<UNK> out of nature -- this is the theme . </S>
It &apos;s especially obvious in the West , starting with England and Holland to the part of the Enlightenment . </S>
They are in the same kids , but after generation of Y , it has not been the age of birth . </S>
I had to focus all of my energy to find new species that live deep down into the corals . </S>
This is a traditional Middle Eastern West , which means there &apos;s a real store in the West . </S>
H stands for <UNK> , including <UNK> of greenhouse gases . </S>
So I fear that the changes are not last , and the <UNK> of the <UNK> limb changes everything . </S>
While we &apos;ve been talking about the first attempt with <UNK> stem cells instead of a surgical solution from the U.S. Congress . </S>
Today , we have the dangerous smoke of Africa &apos;s condescension , who are planning to search for nature , and leave it out that it &apos;s their only hope , to save their families and their culture . </S>
There is a drug called reboxetine , a drug I &apos;ve involved with myself to have a brain disorder . </S>
One day , I crossed the bridge above the <UNK> . </S>
And , does that play ? Yes , it works -- until a certain point . </S>
We think that all of what we do as a single one is actually only a drop in the hot rock that it does not make a real difference . </S>
The challenge to explore the design of nature -- and I &apos;m going to explain how we perceive and use . </S>
Anyone ? And 30 years ? </S>
The mission of education , a revolution in response to other people , will seek out without leaving . </S>
And he repeated this in the next two days , which I was with him to take the 50 times . </S>
I &apos;ve not slept for weeks for weeks . </S>
I thought , for some reason , it &apos;s gone and only for family and sister as well . </S>
Let me tell you about the story of <UNK> , one of 18 <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> , a state in North India . </S>
A typical example of this is : &quot; Well , sometimes you need to lie . &quot; </S>
We connected more of sugar . </S>
I didn &apos;t want to become an artist at all . </S>
The second thing he said was , &quot; If kids don &apos;t have education , education happens . &quot; </S>
Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is it a fake ? Is
While we worked on that , <UNK> the form of <UNK> bottle into a Y bottle , and we thought these words , &quot; <UNK> &quot; and &quot; <UNK> <UNK> , are probably the most important questions , the children . </S>
What we found is a whole series of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses from the same group , so that brand new nuclear power systems . </S>
MBI makes four images a breast . </S>
And lastly , what that means is that expected outcome of baseball ? </S>
We &apos;ve got a lot of classic &quot; jazz ones . &quot; </S>
In the middle , there is an English language that has been done by a professional language for English , that we paid 20 cents a word for his translation . </S>
That means that they specialize in terms of reproduction . </S>
You know , we want to need some sense of our ideas for our ideas . </S>
It &apos;s so wonderful to be back . </S>
Not if you &apos;re a woman who has trouble . Okay , you must get your care skills out there . &quot; </S>
She gets the grape , she eats it . </S>
All arm , just with air . </S>
And he also gave that fake letter from the <UNK> -- in a way , which was an arts project that was funded by the New York subway . </S>
Now , people line , they say things like , &quot; Why do I like electricity ? </S>
Incredible . This is the <UNK> migration of a <UNK> at all . A pretty awful journey . </S>
Now , there are certain situations that mental model does not turn to the reality . </S>
We went to a <UNK> auction in Palo Alto and bought 11 feet in <UNK> . </S>
It &apos;s not <UNK> -- no joke . <UNK> Word in the same thing that you all have of , all mind . </S>
These things evolved at a very short time . </S>
And then I learned to fly an crushed plane . And I got my vow . </S>
But it &apos;s still in Mathare Valley . </S>
I recognize this fear that says , &quot; Is this fair ? &quot; &quot; and &quot; Do you get a job . &quot; </S>
And there &apos;s another sign of oxytocin out there . </S>
And at that time , you &apos;d be sick . </S>
It &apos;s a kind of a blowing off . </S>
Many of you have kids , and that &apos;s a huge change in life . People don &apos;t worry about big change if they &apos;re worth it . </S>
So , when we go out and say acute , there &apos;s no good thing if you &apos;re in the gene -- the equivalent of this virus pretty much the same . But I guarantee that the most common sequence among those viruses on the screen on the top there are in the identical regions . </S>
So let &apos;s just think about data a little bit about data . </S>
After an operation , everything else has changed . </S>
Either we &apos;ve started , and the &quot; the <UNK> &quot; had no effect , or so the groups are so strong so that we can think of ourselves . </S>
Now , if you take the billion viruses out -- and they adjust you to a drop from liquid -- you can drive it to interact with something at the periodic table . </S>
And we see these families , these <UNK> families , from father to son , from father to son , and that hurts . </S>
Has somebody to have the movie of butterfly and star ? </S>
I tried the broccoli . <UNK> . &quot; </S>
And other examples : this was <UNK> to work on the subject . </S>
He came from <UNK> . </S>
I want you to hear the version of the genes , and we &apos;re going to play those first pieces . </S>
We &apos;re learning what it means to communicate with someone who is not just another human being . </S>
That &apos;s what evolution tells us . It &apos;s true . It &apos;s almost ambiguous . </S>
We went around and talk to people who told us , &quot; You can &apos;t do a clinical trial , you know ? </S>
They &apos;ve done so much so that it &apos;s very difficult for them to discover emerging markets , new markets , then it &apos;s going to be <UNK> for you alive . </S>
It turns out we &apos;re fighting and we want to challenge challenges . </S>
Just to say what we &apos;ve shown here , this income , income -- history -- crime and patents , all in a graph . </S>
The most important thing is we get to get big numbers . </S>
And course , without their executives , they wouldn &apos;t survive , and so this makes a difference that nature would go with these <UNK> . </S>
This has to happen to heart resistance as well . </S>
So my jaw sank at the bottom , and after I recovering myself , &quot; I would like to have the sort that the only way the most species had . &quot; </S>
We &apos;ll try to show you the pages in high school . </S>
Are you going to me ? Do you want extinct ? </S>
So this kind of into a <UNK> system , pretty much like the stars . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> -- <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> -- <UNK> <UNK> -- the voice of Doc , and the <UNK> sounds of listeners . </S>
So , I &apos;m looking at other things in terms of physics . </S>
Then we went to <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> . </S>
And your politics isn &apos;t very special . </S>
And that &apos;s where young men disappeared . </S>
Why not ? Every virus is the virus , insects and nuclear power . </S>
In fact , I applied to the local College in <UNK> , and was rejected by all seven attacks . </S>
Audience : Itay Talgam : Why not ? </S>
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks . </S>
I felt it was an uncomfortable reaction to my family . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , with a pole with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and the idea that she could go back into something interesting environment , so that they could see what they see , and they understand how they operate and interact with each other , and what it should happen next , and what it should happen next , and what these ideas are going to go out ? &quot; </S>
I know nobody &apos;s going to be involved in our supply chain . </S>
There &apos;s a project I &apos;m going to show you , so I &apos;m very excited about it and I wanted to share it with you , because it &apos;s about building a new level of trust . </S>
If you &apos;ve done the lens now , you literally literally pull it out . </S>
But don &apos;t interact with people who don &apos;t interact like you themselves . </S>
But I found that there &apos;s almost no way to find someone who is supplying that treatment . </S>
People are looking at decades there . </S>
Open you up . Or do you do surgery ? </S>
<UNK> is more important for us than that . </S>
They never did something . </S>
And she came to the town and she sat down and she said , &quot; I need to buy new shoes ! &quot; </S>
The other way is that a certain kind of <UNK> that you want to know about are going to be like little girls . </S>
It &apos;ll take a day where you can make hundreds of thousands of tests very cheaply , if you like to know , You can experience about your own legacy . </S>
Peace is not the pigeon , and the rainbow -- that &apos;s how beautiful you might like . </S>
You know , during the first two years old , they killed all our animals into the gardening classes . </S>
And I &apos;m asking this question . </S>
And in fact , what kind of work they &apos;re trying to do to enrich the world , abandon them , to take that out . </S>
So there -- you got to -- you know , this is amazing because it &apos;s really amazing , because you get to see living animals in a new way . </S>
In some respects they literally had this kind of symbolic look at mathematics , in fact , they couldn &apos;t see what happens with their noses and their noses . </S>
The mind will be the best that can organize and put it in any context , but it does not have a lot of success . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
Obviously , since we &apos;re a gamer model , technological trends are something we need to know about , and that we need to know . </S>
It &apos;s <UNK> deeply . </S>
These are the cells all around . </S>
Today , <UNK> can build a robot like the industrial worm , the one my father and I &apos;ve been trying to build . </S>
And with this problem , we need to do something . </S>
So there &apos;s no reason why you really don &apos;t have the technology at a time . </S>
But , Julie , you were so ready to school . &quot; You were so ready . &quot; </S>
I was asked to come out to <UNK> , and even forward to that fourth and fifth five and a lecture . </S>
The bears that play more . </S>
It &apos;s simple , the goats , very simple . </S>
And the only way I think the best way is to get people to take the idea seriously that the world &apos;s maybe not flat , is not nearly flat , is data and fact <UNK> . </S>
They &apos;re in some of their masks . </S>
The company created the state of 190 million dollars . </S>
How are projects with creative vision and a lot of complexity like the Pantheon even implemented ? </S>
However , low social class is called , well , the underlying effective actions . </S>
It &apos;s not just about the fact that I told you about Zimbabwe , but to the defenders around the world , who are looking for these hydrogen nets . </S>
And that means &quot; easy and <UNK> , &quot; could not be easily and <UNK> , and things that we think we need for complex , might just be <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
I certainly never a ignored failure . </S>
And in some cases , oxytocin can even boost the timing . </S>
We can take objective data by analog arguments . </S>
The energy that I tell you about a chemical energy turned into my food , was originally from a nuclear reaction , and so I think it &apos;s a little bit to perfect in terms of energy , and to use it as an innovative social model . </S>
So I sat there for two months , and I tried to make various opportunities for the next changed year of my life as a photographer , because they would take me safely . </S>
<UNK> dunes are just one fifth of our deserts . </S>
Together with these kids , I also did a remarkable change . </S>
Guess what would that come up ? </S>
So I can take this data -- and they transform it , reflecting the symptoms on the left , and then they say anything we know about Steven and everybody else and what &apos;s all together . </S>
So , how are we doing this ? </S>
I got an email from him , and it was , &quot; Hi , Ray Ray . </S>
A lot of sleep variation in itself is not interesting . </S>
And that &apos;s where I became interested in how to make matters of what life is worth living . </S>
You &apos;ve probably heard of cholera here from cholera , but we don &apos;t hear what our autism &apos;s hearing . </S>
The acid stocks on the Artic Ridge reservation between 85 and 90 percent . </S>
So , the power of being able to be able to go into a new way and to build themselves to the entrepreneurs about how that financial service should look like them and the people they &apos;re walking around , they &apos;ve launched this week <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> , to get what they need to get through the investment of family and friends . </S>
They &apos;re rooted in an integrated story of the bubbles , started in the &apos; 50s with the Global <UNK> crash , followed by many others . </S>
This is a fourth way that you &apos;ve been going to be coming out by now . </S>
It &apos;s the other <UNK> . &#91; not &quot; the &quot; World Trade Organization &quot; &#93; &quot; </S>
And we &apos;re very bad at it ; it &apos;s a very difficult problem . </S>
You can learn three interesting things . </S>
Maybe , these critics have learned from their last lesson . </S>
It became part of an absolute transformative way of dealing with people . </S>
Now , some of us may even choose to fill in a pair of light that they remembered to wash their hands . </S>
California has the highest risk of distributed wiped out there against all 50 states . </S>
Maybe a dig in American <UNK> where you &apos;d never seen a <UNK> <UNK> , who was a <UNK> vagina , I became infected with an <UNK> of <UNK> eyes . </S>
These forests grow to grow 10 times faster than conventional protein , they &apos;re much more dense and richer . </S>
It &apos;s not about charity , because it &apos;s not about charity . </S>
It &apos;s one of the most <UNK> things that came out . </S>
It makes failure invisible , unthinkable and unavoidable . </S>
It &apos;s a pretty special one . It was just one of the things in front of Parliament , when the economy collapsed in the <UNK> . She was developed with a Ph.D. center , and now we started doing this project . </S>
On the other side of the world , a teenager used to take a video and send it to a whole stranger . </S>
We want to take <UNK> and measure . </S>
You can see some interesting , typical , urban cities . </S>
And I also won &apos;t be an issue for choice biological institutional imperative , because if somebody believes your sexual orientation is a decision , then you can try &quot; gray . &quot; </S>
A chromosome , of course , is just a piece of recycled material material . </S>
So I &apos;m just going to show you quickly , meet Romo captures a video so that you see me and all of the TED audiences . </S>
And a third occurred to that <UNK> of <UNK> and she said , &quot; Mr. <UNK> , I answer X count ; they &apos;ll give me X number . &quot; </S>
And it isn &apos;t . That &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen . Look at the picture . </S>
And if you &apos;ve been here , the clinic is closed and you need to go back . And you &apos;re so engaged , struggling with other things to move , and move it all over , until it &apos;s too late . </S>
And it turns out that technology isn &apos;t actually dying . </S>
Thank you . </S>
So let me show you here . </S>
In every spot , we built exhibitions in history , and history went back to travel . </S>
If you want to look at large volumes , then it &apos;s about behaviors . </S>
A piece of bread can drive forever , and hope becomes your bread for you to live alive . </S>
I never read an interview or a lecture or a lecture . </S>
And we can go to the library . &quot; </S>
My hypothesis is that American soldiers are good , usually . </S>
And the people , depending on who they are , between 90 percent and 95 percent of their energy to go to a destination . </S>
Now , let me show you -- the only issue at TEDMED -- that pleasure is so important for our health , I &apos;m going to keep getting so few behaviors if they don &apos;t give you a sense of fun . </S>
I talked to a lot of friends out of the <UNK> , and they -- I asked her , &quot; Well , what kind of device should people consider every human being to know more ? &quot; </S>
I &apos;ve just contacted him in the course of many moments of jazz mathematics using his life to be infused and suing guests around all over the world . </S>
Have you been watching the box ? </S>
To follow those rules into origami , we can actually see pattern , like this visible crease crease pattern , called <UNK> , which is not orally for themselves . </S>
And I &apos;ll get back to that in high school , because I think the results are striking until now , and I &apos;m just looking forward into the future and I &apos;m happy to think about what &apos;s going to happen in the next eight years , as we go forward into 2015 . </S>
White was an empowered help , and the idea that he agreed to me was an awful shock to me . </S>
But this is only the case , because I &apos;m putting it down a flat surface . </S>
Now , there are all sorts of <UNK> systems that you have in the wild , in the real world , things like shake out -- sit and so forth . </S>
And <UNK> <UNK> at the edge of the ice here waiting there &apos;s a whale whale being close up close enough to attack this , and if a shark , they throw it out and cut it into the top , under the ice , and cut it into pieces . </S>
But because of our partner based on social fields -- like <UNK> , <UNK> and the Sierra Club and crab -- there was actually something to change after a film . </S>
I hope I will never hide out again , and I hope that I can change statistics through my country statistics and help other people to live in and live to be more and more fulfilled , both at work and in the building . </S>
A doc can get serious , but it &apos;s reassuring , a great medicine . </S>
And Rick <UNK> described this in the last two years ... </S>
I &apos;m a human who has been very much of luck . </S>
So this is a wonderful place of time you can interfere with this , and you know what happened in adolescence . </S>
The population of Europe &apos;s first instituted , 20 percent in about 65 years old . </S>
It &apos;s as if you &apos;d take someone out of a <UNK> house to deal with food , and then in the house , because oil kept it up further from the leak . </S>
To dream of them there &apos;s a goal , we hope , when our dreams died , pray when our hope has left hope . </S>
If you think about the loss , that the eruption of a disaster , I believe that we &apos;ve done a lot to do what effects have on the ocean , for a long , long time . </S>
I &apos;ve just got my education out of some other way . </S>
Our Asian culture of South Africans need to be known as painful as painful . </S>
So , thanks to my dear teenage years of fact , I &apos;m on the Internet , on the two best friends of a football game , Google and Wikipedia . </S>
My story is the two brains . They like it might be unexpected , our gut is a brain brain . </S>
So we looked at this stuff , and we moved on to the side of the leg to return to to more politically serious issue . </S>
This is extremely rare in mammals . </S>
It will be a place where people can meet , where it &apos;s room for nature . </S>
All I was seeing in business was the right passion between the <UNK> between the <UNK> and the <UNK> . </S>
Simple , isn &apos;t it . </S>
B means , for example , this little yellow point goes up to the starfish , the protocell starfish , and so on . </S>
Through the <UNK> and God for me unknown , I could use the bits of my past , <UNK> , <UNK> . </S>
So I &apos;m going to make more of the elements within any individual . </S>
This is a completely solo , and I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m telling you that , but at that moment , when everybody laughed , I knew I shouldn &apos;t . </S>
60 houses were broken , and 40 were broken . </S>
Our teachers deserve a better treatment . </S>
What was most surprised with most of the most acute precision is every time that he has been to , every <UNK> that he has got , every <UNK> he had , and what it used to happen to realize for innovation . </S>
So we thought we could just make a model -- <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> , so that you can calculate from different parts of the year , you can actually calculate those <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> in your skin -- <UNK> and NO . </S>
My family &apos;s poor , the health care system in my home . </S>
In <UNK> , about every five black white voters have said , &quot; Yeah , one of the important reasons why I voted for Barack Obama is he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; OK ? &quot; </S>
But I had a problem because I &apos;m making all of this flying stuff and people will say , &quot; Oh , I know your work . </S>
And I wanted to move that freedom of motion . </S>
And so you could link them with government performances , but a neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative to civic services . </S>
They define the system . </S>
Saturn itself is a rich <UNK> . </S>
And then they aggregate , and they sell it to the top as a greater price as an unfair agent at all . Very strange is . </S>
Andy <UNK> is working on increasing , sent to the L.A. at <UNK> , engaging with <UNK> and urban <UNK> -- making tree trees , connecting people and engineering to create a greener town . </S>
And he goes , and you stop looking at some of the rare birds and algae and weird faces . </S>
Please look at this short video of my recent video here , &quot; Kids in the Taliban . &quot; </S>
What do you think was up ? &quot; </S>
I &apos;d like to use an <UNK> ad called <UNK> -- the fall of a children &apos;s book called &quot; <UNK> <UNK> , &quot; an <UNK> for everything that means &quot; <UNK> , &quot; to find it , in <UNK> , <UNK> , etc . <UNK> , October . &quot; </S>
Now , I wasn &apos;t necessarily asking an interest in what &apos;s going on in my life , but the science became an entirely new appreciation of stress . </S>
So here are architectural archetypes , built out of the desert itself . </S>
It has very important effects on understanding of the failure of failure , as well as an austerity , as long as it &apos;s engaging in the core , which is the most <UNK> cause of killer evidence . </S>
Now I am here and I talk about his idea . </S>
It was an extraordinary honor to meet some of my <UNK> in Britain &apos;s behalf , women , all of whom they &apos;re out of the path . </S>
Our cities are being placed in the last few years , are with electronics and electronics . </S>
But this question is often , and it makes me sad at the point : &quot; How about corruption ? </S>
It wasn &apos;t until first , but the idea that he launched was the city &apos;s Tokyo , and the surrounding Native figures are the oats . </S>
We &apos;re going to go through four arguments that we &apos;re going to see and drive the new <UNK> , called the new <UNK> . </S>
Sometimes , I put people back to their place at the table , in fact , if they had built this function , and put it in their little wooden chairs . </S>
They asked that to give you a 10 year-old name ? </S>
And it &apos;s not about finding a profitable cure , or a successful cure , we &apos;ll find the cure . </S>
But most of all , I want you just for any human and away from that , to appreciate the girl in order to get from the part that goes from the part of the value , to appreciate that part of the body , to understand that it &apos;s in the future . </S>
Everything in nature is wasted in a constant cycle , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re driving over the beginning of the beginning , and that &apos;s what happened for some period of time . And it &apos;s an important statement to understand . </S>
One was his <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
But so -- and I want to show you some numbers . </S>
And I just came to the bottom : If you go around and sit down and sit with one glass of red red , and talk to people as well , you don &apos;t really want to talk all the time . </S>
Now , let me introduce you three of our students . </S>
And during Ivan continues , there is a storm and the bread of the box comes out of the grass . </S>
This is not an especially <UNK> thing . </S>
If you just put it together with the overall overall score , it looks like it was up in this century to 600 degrees Fahrenheit . </S>
Except that light in the real world isn &apos;t going that way . </S>
And that makes the computer so powerful , these <UNK> , that can be put together . </S>
And you can see , it &apos;s a <UNK> , in terms of the precision , of engaging , of innovation and <UNK> of <UNK> violence . </S>
Well , um <UNK> . <UNK> me , just kidding me out . </S>
And there was one group within a company that was in a different building . </S>
And this is how you get this product . This is here -- I haven &apos;t changed anything , and this is the original . </S>
What we need to think about , if we think about conservatives -- except this case , the beginning of the beginning -- is this is what you want to be , you go to church . </S>
It &apos;s quite cool . You can get a lot of <UNK> with your <UNK> . </S>
I think I &apos;m going to start with a simple twist ! </S>
There are a lot of people who think about all these poor people : &quot; Oh , all this horrible things . <UNK> out their buildings . &quot; </S>
This has not been noticed in the regular consumption of land that have been applied to the data . </S>
This whole plant has toes . </S>
A linear , a <UNK> . </S>
Those who are here who are you who are going to ask yourselves , where is the United States ? </S>
But she had been trained to escape from those men into blue uniform , and when they came to them now , oh , they had a very good wire to them . </S>
If you notice a Triceratops , you see how it changes , its <UNK> . </S>
There &apos;s a major graffiti version , called <UNK> , about 40 feet to the surface of the glacier . </S>
Thank you so much . </S>
They divided into different screens , and added its own version . </S>
We can either dig or dig , or we can feed the wind for us . </S>
Anyway , I went out of his office , and I went through this hospital -- and there I had my epiphany . </S>
Good afternoon . </S>
Fortunately , the majority of the family , to the better part of the community , to the better part of the future , let &apos;s take a moment of arguing and begin to discuss . </S>
And then you can do a shared model , you know , a common call center . </S>
What I &apos;m going to say in this school is some of the things I &apos;m going to say , is going to cause an agreement . </S>
And in doing so , we &apos;ve got a better way into autonomous communities , which might need to be able to take the infrastructure off , instead of pulling down trees and building the spaces for the edges . </S>
But what &apos;s the only thing you &apos;re dealing with at <UNK> , or in there we &apos;re deep sleep deep ? </S>
So I closed her eyes , I got her breath , and the first melody I ever came to my mind and was of course , &quot; <UNK> &quot; theory of &quot; <UNK> and Bess . &quot; </S>
<UNK> number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure . </S>
We &apos;ve been doing , <UNK> <UNK> -- the kids home to get to the bus to come back to work , to go through politics , to get very quickly to cook , and for a couple of valuable hours of football players at Sunday morning , on the beginning of the day , from the beginning of the day , by the beginning of the day , and the <UNK> . </S>
And the website , and the project , really , is the very <UNK> . </S>
I mean , I was really the high high school for me . </S>
This will be about five o &apos;clock right now . </S>
For example , in the previous <UNK> , there &apos;s new rules out there . </S>
Maybe there &apos;s going to be a bad day , you could get better than that . </S>
To conclude , the architecture is moving me out . </S>
So the challenges of education , on a place like this , not kings and learning from Kenya and United Kingdom . </S>
A few years ago , I realized that there is an orange cloud on the planet . </S>
But I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ve got to get help in the right way . </S>
JE : And when that theory means that while a mouse feels like this , it &apos;s going to smell , hear and touch it from a series of zeroes . </S>
We can show our results . We can make things better than that . </S>
We would reduce dramatically dramatically dramatically by building cities for the people . </S>
Thank you so much . </S>
There &apos;s always been done <UNK> . </S>
You know , I really am very proud of you here , to that conversation . </S>
Now , the natural selection selection has been great , incredibly powerful . </S>
And what keeps looking at , in fact , in getting 150 schools to 7,000 children . </S>
Literally , from the microbes from the ocean &apos;s meat , in fact , we proved as a cure for questionable drugs in some people . </S>
I &apos;ll show you this . </S>
It must have been a very unusual day . </S>
I look at myself as a spiritual person , just without drying out , and I don &apos;t think there &apos;s going to be anything . </S>
And the last thing I &apos;m going to show you is the latest <UNK> machine , is something that I created with Hal <UNK> , who was introduced by my colleague of a previous project , Bill <UNK> . </S>
If you think about how the world was so fast , you have a headrest who wanted to arrest you . </S>
&quot; Let us read this mom a letter . </S>
What &apos;s going on here ? &quot; </S>
Between March 19 , 2012 , the finalists of the competition has been discovered . </S>
So you &apos;ll see on the history of the history of cellulose is now about a technological invention ; it &apos;s a <UNK> for invention with a wide range . </S>
We need to move around and patients <UNK> from the idea that you need to travel for their own lives for a special place and travel system , because these places are often the wrong and most expensive tools for their own . </S>
There are over 40,000 varieties of spiders . </S>
These artifacts of rooms and shops are so interesting . </S>
Fortunately , this a few years ago , because I heard a gentleman , Dr. <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
So I had to do it , I had to dance as I was writing . </S>
And so I wanted to come up with something to be a better teacher , and to give my students in English as well as an educational system and bigger than better <UNK> or more points in some sense . </S>
Republicans say that Republican , Republicans . That &apos;s no surprise . </S>
Your heartbeat decrease your heartbeat , they &apos;re living longer , energy efficient and nutrients throughout the membranes to slow down , etc . , etc . </S>
What country did the model ? </S>
And of course , this is the <UNK> . </S>
People have the remarkably interesting thing , often to be able to look at a depth of pain against controlled conditions and enjoy it -- like , for example , <UNK> <UNK> . </S>
The truth is , there &apos;s an economy -- there &apos;s no <UNK> like <UNK> , but it &apos;s a <UNK> . </S>
So for example , every single emotion of marriage is different or endangered society -- but there are some commonalities that are visible , if there are endangered species that are rising , but there are going to be many democracy faster , are getting richer and larger after their top , they go together . <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> of the second to be the first <UNK> , and only a few decades after building their greatest set of countries , and only a few centuries after building their greatest monuments , and as the population is the highest . </S>
There are 1.1 billion people whose toilet are the roads , the waterfront , public places , and that &apos;s the technical term for public health services , but that &apos;s just in the open . </S>
That &apos;s why ? I say this because , again , nothing exists , if not a good reason , our beautiful , your civilization , your civilization . </S>
I used to be a <UNK> . </S>
This message came from in the last few weeks . </S>
What &apos;s out . </S>
It &apos;s entertainment , fun and relief had to be the most important . </S>
All of that took me two out of the seven days in the week . </S>
Some of them were sold by bones to Japan , where they sold for 15,000 dollars a piece . </S>
Just to that story , what I &apos;ve been getting so used to be like this . </S>
But of course , this pipe is easy to have its surface . </S>
And he sings right in their ear . </S>
I don &apos;t know that &apos;s an issue , but I want to convince you that there &apos;s something else in that . </S>
You know nothing . You hear more . Where is it ? </S>
So I mean that Western and African diplomats , the peacekeepers who are the victims of the United Nations , the staff of most nongovernmental workers who work on the solution to conflict , all the world in a particular way . </S>
Fortunately , Dr. <UNK> <UNK> came up in the fossil record . </S>
So if we can figure out how we can do it , we have the vaccine , and it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s some evidence for that we &apos;re getting to solve this problem . </S>
AG : But what will it be used ? What &apos;s the use of this ? </S>
And if you &apos;re a little propeller here . </S>
It is the kind of complicated cycle I want to share with you today . </S>
Ooh . Good . Good . </S>
So , people aren &apos;t easy to help . And there are books that criticize the U.S. foreign aid . </S>
And she told me , she stopped to go to the clinic after the study died , because they &apos;re not sick for the bus to be sick , to go to the 35 miles . </S>
They are less rare than the <UNK> , but it &apos;s not so rare . </S>
And if I said all this , for free , you &apos;d just say , you know . </S>
I know there are other businesses in relation to compassion , but Google is the environment I know for 10 years . So I &apos;m going to use Google as a rubber band . </S>
And I just gave them antibiotics that we had for tuberculosis . </S>
He bleeds out . </S>
You don &apos;t find any Saudi penguins in Argentina . </S>
I just want to just to figure out how important this event was . </S>
But look at this : If the world were wealthy as large as the United States is now , there would be five times as many scientists and engineers who would go public grades and all that would share . </S>
In fact , <UNK> on <UNK> acts . </S>
It &apos;s a <UNK> knee with <UNK> mimicking mimicking the natural human knee . </S>
Something weird , which I love to be in this area , next to this robot , where you can get books on request , those little brain systems that come out . </S>
He said , &quot; He called the <UNK> &quot; and &quot; <UNK> , &quot; it took him to meet him and he helped him to meet girls . </S>
Now , I don &apos;t know what you think about it , but I think that &apos;s a pretty stupid decision , because what you &apos;ve done with that is you &apos;ve made a permanent gap of destruction by making it look like this , but it would cover the destruction forever . </S>
You cannot tell from the war system from the war of Vietnam . </S>
But if we &apos;re exploring this last frontier on this planet , then we need to live there . </S>
You can move those colors . You can drive it . Or maybe something else . </S>
Happy students sit in large classes . </S>
The second assumption that the American views of choices are affected , is something like that . </S>
The average lifespan in the United States and the U.K. is <UNK> years , but we know more than a thousand professional scientific research that you can convert to the masses of your four to 10 years . </S>
And she said , &quot; Well the first thing that everybody is learning is that you need to encourage the Koran for education , you need to support it as well . </S>
They &apos;re supposed to be in the future themselves and everything else to survive . </S>
Is there a limit for us as we live together ? </S>
Just do that just make the red one , and then they &apos;d be quite simple , and then , until you reverse , there are 20 different kinds of hustles . They &apos;re based on variations . </S>
And I want it to imagine , it &apos;s a picture of you . </S>
There are three now , and they need to stay there . </S>
It &apos;s not a <UNK> . </S>
On one hand , we have Mathematica , with what &apos;s happening from the ground , <UNK> language and structure of a large network of microorganisms , can make a lot of numbers to do with just a few lines . </S>
What is the common denominator between oil and plastic and operational ? </S>
They used this software so far to target all sorts of things , from roads all up to to local homes , to local businesses , to <UNK> . </S>
By 2015 , in the United States , more than 60 years old , than under 15 . </S>
Everything came in my laptop and my cell phone . </S>
And thank you the World of the World , and that uses so many governments and funds that 20 million Nigerians in 2009 were released in 2009 . </S>
And so my question is , yeah , let &apos;s try and address the politics over the Middle East , but let &apos;s take a look at history . </S>
He said , &quot; No , I would talk to the individuals . &quot; </S>
We called the Project Face 2 bases . </S>
And people get to learn a lot about their various studies , for example , at birth , in childbirth , when they &apos;re being told by is the circuit side of its mother . </S>
For example , if you damage through layers of injury , they don &apos;t work well . You can &apos;t leave the mucus out of the body . </S>
It &apos;s our health , our lives , our own , our children . </S>
So , the chairs : <UNK> and <UNK> . </S>
BF : You know , over the last couple of years has been a kind of a tradition of us , something dangerous to Richard , and we &apos;ve done this in our <UNK> . This is a funny thing to do with Daniel I. </S>
There was a lot of social inequity . </S>
So you can see why you should have just , you know , say , you know , consciously , you know , isolated Indians ? </S>
It &apos;s similar to a jet jet . </S>
But to my defense , I have so much of it , that I never submitted to the logo . </S>
They &apos;re protecting the balance up into our ecosystems , save us . </S>
And specifically , I &apos;d like to say a few words about <UNK> , and this project &apos;s a little bit different than the previous two , but they &apos;re both very conducive the similar features of the experience , the engineering skills and the mathematics to work all at the universities , because we need to believe that in math , that means that everything else ought to be taught . </S>
Somebody always watches us . </S>
They had found extraordinary successful . </S>
And I was lucky , because I had a lot of options . </S>
At the end of the first , we ran together , and what we did was we want to follow what &apos;s going on . </S>
Today , 54 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , which is a spread of eight billion dollar media media . </S>
Some people call that peer-to-peer . </S>
And that doesn &apos;t change at all aspects of their life . </S>
If you look at the Y-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a 50 percent chance of living with potential lighting in contact or indirectly , as if it &apos;s rising up outside . </S>
So when I got out of the preparation , it was still like that there was two schools . </S>
It &apos;s almost as if it &apos;s developing the idea of the symmetries . </S>
I want to turn out of your interest and your commitment to put this vision out here . </S>
Goodbye Abraham Lincoln . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> was not an <UNK> , who was the <UNK> in the <UNK> of the <UNK> , and later later . </S>
I was crying . They asked me to come in . </S>
We &apos;ve created a model that shows where these fields may be . </S>
So we &apos;re in denial , and we don &apos;t really want to make a lot of what &apos;s really going on here . Okay , here &apos;s the really key thing here . </S>
So this brings up to the lessons at Number two : cells make the whole work . </S>
Google Dennett , &quot; Grey . &quot; </S>
Well , the average American will be to take the moral exercise in the head of this person , and to have something with that person in common ? </S>
But it &apos;s massive , both in the scale and it &apos;s an important part . </S>
Because as high quality , we &apos;ve been asking for higher prices . </S>
They want to participate in the <UNK> department , but only when they &apos;re paying attention . They &apos;re interested in it . </S>
You had to have a car seat , and on the left you have Rupert Murdoch , or the BBC , the BBC . </S>
And I always had these things . </S>
It &apos;s an invitation , perhaps even a <UNK> to enter the <UNK> of your life , the <UNK> and the bars that we never want to enter , but when we &apos;re entering it , we feel we feel too strongly when we do it . </S>
Today , the IMF has remained limited means by one percent . </S>
I &apos;m the daughter of a man who participated all throughout his life , was the leader of the optimists . </S>
It literally <UNK> . </S>
Judge Forer did what they had to do , and afterwards they did , they did their chair . </S>
And although I think it &apos;s safe to play -- because I know something about it -- I think it &apos;s able to look at his own desires and his own inner drive , which I think has made his basis in all of us in human history . </S>
And why are these information ? </S>
Many of us , I imagine that the exploitation of the oceans in the last 50 or maybe 100 years ago was really becoming serious . </S>
So we &apos;ve done a section of the mouse systems and these are all the kind of cool technologies . Each of these with the little things around here : saying , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s just try to do this thing : &quot; God has this red little thing to think that it means that it &apos;s only a neural framework , it might have the cells that tells it , then perhaps is what it says to the nuclei , which is what is it like to do . &quot; </S>
As you can see , the spectrum is really diverse . </S>
There are a number of other problems with it . It &apos;s very hard to make it happen . </S>
And the passion it is growing is the most important of humanity . </S>
I was born without my left -- without my right hand . </S>
By 2015 , we &apos;re going to have three billion hands on the planet . </S>
The house they used to be empty . </S>
I believed everybody could . </S>
<UNK> includes this idea of something very valuable . </S>
Scientists at Penn University began <UNK> the bees at their food . They noticed that every grain of malaria , the bee can collect at least six million <UNK> of pesticides , even as well as herbicides , <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> , who are the <UNK> and the toxic than are the active ingredient . </S>
Each time it goes up to the center , they &apos;re looking at the interface of the interface as if they were throwing out the environment , and then they &apos;re spinning . </S>
Then it &apos;s like -- I should be nervous , because it &apos;s an even better ? </S>
Our data industry , we &apos;re very unfair on this system . </S>
They both have two , they &apos;re both a light bulb . </S>
So , instead of looking at under some of the rooms at home , you can actually see these burst-pulsed devices , and getting over and collected over here , getting wet and wet and roll off with a light tunnel into a dark tunnel . </S>
OK . So , most of you think , B is right . </S>
Okay , so let me show you something more . </S>
Maybe he &apos;s going to take an impact on the sweet side of it , a massive transformation in the way in which we look at life . </S>
Easy and becomes a portable . </S>
We need to be concerned with that there are differences among individuals we know , and also between the <UNK> be
