Well , in my part , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . </S>
This three-dimensional energy we refer to as the mass of an agency and the discovery of the Higgs record clearly by the LHC clearly proving that this substance is real , because it is the recycling . </S>

We think that all of what we do as a single one is actually only a drop in the hot rock that it does not make a real difference . </S>
The challenge to explore the design of nature -- and I &apos;m going to explain how we perceive and use . </S>
Anyone ? And 30 years ? </S>

What we found is a whole series of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses from the same group , so that brand new nuclear power systems . </S>
MBI makes four images a breast . </S>

We &apos;ve got a lot of classic &quot; jazz ones . &quot; </S>
In the middle , there is an English language that has been done by a professional language for English , that we paid 20 cents a word for his translation . </S>

And he also gave that fake letter from the <UNK> -- in a way , which was an arts project that was funded by the New York subway . </S>
Now , people line , they say things like , &quot; Why do I like electricity ? </S>
Incredible . This is the <UNK> migration of a <UNK> at all . A pretty awful journey . </S>
Now , there are certain situations that mental model does not turn to the reality . </S>
We went to a <UNK> auction in Palo Alto and bought 11 feet in <UNK> . </S>
It &apos;s not <UNK> -- no joke . <UNK> Word in the same thing that you all have of , all mind . </S>
These things evolved at a very short time . </S>
And then I learned to fly an crushed plane . And I got my vow . </S>
But it &apos;s still in Mathare Valley . </S>
I recognize this fear that says , &quot; Is this fair ? &quot; &quot; and &quot; Do you get a job . &quot; </S>
And there &apos;s another sign of oxytocin out there . </S>
And at that time , you &apos;d be sick . </S>
It &apos;s a kind of a blowing off . </S>
Many of you have kids , and that &apos;s a huge change in life . People don &apos;t worry about big change if they &apos;re worth it . </S>
So , when we go out and say acute , there &apos;s no good thing if you &apos;re in the gene -- the equivalent of this virus pretty much the same . But I guarantee that the most common sequence among those viruses on the screen on the top there are in the identical regions . </S>
So let &apos;s just think about data a little bit about data . </S>
After an operation , everything else has changed . </S>
Either we &apos;ve started , and the &quot; the <UNK> &quot; had no effect , or so the groups are so strong so that we can think of ourselves . </S>
Now , if you take the billion viruses out -- and they adjust you to a drop from liquid -- you can drive it to interact with something at the periodic table . </S>
And we see these families , these <UNK> families , from father to son , from father to son , and that hurts . </S>
Has somebody to have the movie of butterfly and star ? </S>
I tried the broccoli . <UNK> . &quot; </S>
And other examples : this was <UNK> to work on the subject . </S>
He came from <UNK> . </S>
I want you to hear the version of the genes , and we &apos;re going to play those first pieces . </S>
We &apos;re learning what it means to communicate with someone who is not just another human being . </S>
That &apos;s what evolution tells us . It &apos;s true . It &apos;s almost ambiguous . </S>
We went around and talk to people who told us , &quot; You can &apos;t do a clinical trial , you know ? </S>
They &apos;ve done so much so that it &apos;s very difficult for them to discover emerging markets , new markets , then it &apos;s going to be <UNK> for you alive . </S>
It turns out we &apos;re fighting and we want to challenge challenges . </S>
Just to say what we &apos;ve shown here , this income , income -- history -- crime and patents , all in a graph . </S>
The most important thing is we get to get big numbers . </S>
And course , without their executives , they wouldn &apos;t survive , and so this makes a difference that nature would go with these <UNK> . </S>
This has to happen to heart resistance as well . </S>
So my jaw sank at the bottom , and after I recovering myself , &quot; I would like to have the sort that the only way the most species had . &quot; </S>
We &apos;ll try to show you the pages in high school . </S>
Are you going to me ? Do you want extinct ? </S>
So this kind of into a <UNK> system , pretty much like the stars . </S>
<UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> -- <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> -- <UNK> <UNK> -- the voice of Doc , and the <UNK> sounds of listeners . </S>
So , I &apos;m looking at other things in terms of physics . </S>
Then we went to <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> . </S>
And your politics isn &apos;t very special . </S>
And that &apos;s where young men disappeared . </S>
